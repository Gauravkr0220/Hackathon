 
 Abstract  In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) refers to computational reconstruction of an unknown 3D magnetic resonance volume from stacks of 2D slices corrupted by motion. While promising, current SVR methods require multiple slice stacks for accurate 3D reconstruction, leading to long scans and limiting their use in time-sensitive applications such as fetal fMRI. Here, we propose a SVR method that overcomes the shortcomings of previous work and produces state-of-the-art reconstructions in the presence of extreme inter-slice motion. Inspired by the recent success of single-view depth estimation methods, we formulate SVR as a single-stack motion estimation task and train a fully convolutional network to predict a motion stack for a given slice stack, producing a 3D reconstruction as a byproduct of the predicted motion. Extensive experiments on the SVR of adult and fetal brains demonstrate that our fully convolutional method is twice as accurate as previous SVR methods. Our code is available at github.com/seannz/svr. 1. Introduction  For non-invasive imaging of the brain where the subject may potentially exhibit severe uncontrollable motion—such as in the case of the fetal population—two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are typically used to acquire a stack of 2D brain slices and assemble them into a 3D volume, a computational procedure often referred to as slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR). Unlike 3D MRI acquisitions where the entire 𝑘-space (Fourier) coeﬃcients can become corrupted even from a single motion event, 2D techniques can restrict this corruption to within a slice while leaving the 𝑘-space data for the other slices intact. Le SVR procedure can then be applied on the non-corrupted slices to enable artifact-free imaging of the brain and facilitate other downstream tasks, such as brain morphometry [1–3], whole brain segmentation [4–6] and atlas creation [7–9].  A large number of classical SVR techniques [10–18] are descended from the work of Rousseau et al. [19], where the SVR task is posed as an optimization problem to recover an unknown 3D volume from observed 2D slices. Such inverse methods do not have the capability to learn the latent space of reconstructions, and as a result, typically require multiple orthogonal slice stacks to cross-regularize the estimation of the motion of each stack, adding a computational burden to an already iterative numerical method. More recent methods [20–25] overcome the burden of numerical optimization by directly predicting the position parameters of 2D slices with neural network models. However, these approaches process slices independently of each other and cannot constrain the reconstruction in 3D space [20–22] or require multiple slice stacks for accurate reconstruction [25], precluding their use in time-sensitive applications such as fetal fMRI [26, 27].  In the closely related tasks of pairwise image registration [28–32], motion [33–39] and depth estimation [40–43], fully convolutional network (FCN) architectures have been used Figure 1: Method overview. Inspired by monocular disparity estimation (a), we tackle slice-to-volume reconstruction (b) by predicting slice motion from a single stack of 2D slices using a fully convolutional network model. ?e intensities of the 2D slices are splatted using the slice motion predicted by our network and the splatting is then interpolated to produce an artifact-free 3D MR reconstruction.

 to enable accurate non-iterative prediction of an underlying deformation, motion and disparity from a pair of images. By formulating the SVR task as a supervised motion estimation problem, we can reduce the task at hand to a problem that is more readily tackled using a convolutional framework. Lis convolutional approach to SVR bears a certain resemblance to monocular depth estimation, where disparity is predicted from a single view [42]. Lis is illustrated in Figure 1.  In this work, we propose a fully convolutional method for SVR with application to single-stack MRI. We pose the SVR task as a supervised image registration problem and train a convolutional network on paired (slice stack, motion stack) data to predict slice motion directly, producing a 3D volume reconstruction as a result (Figure 2). Our approach requires only a single slice stack for reconstruction, is many orders of magnitude faster than optimization approaches [10–18], and reduces error in the predicted motion by 2× compared to the recent transformer-based model [25]. Our contributions are: • Splat–Slice U-Net Model. We interpret the iterations of classical SVR as a series of splat and slice operations to design a 3D FCN model for fast slice motion prediction. • Supervised Learning. We formulate a parameter-free loss function to facilitate training with true slice motion for slice motion prediction with sub-voxel accuracy. • Artifact-Free Reconstruction. We obtain artifact-free 3D reconstructions by splatting slice data and imputing missing intensities via supervised interpolation. 2. Related Work  In fetal imaging, slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) is an important inverse problem with reconstruction methods ranging from traditional optimization-based ones [10–19] to recent learning-based ones [20–25], which we now review.  2.1. Optimization Approaches  Optimization-based SVR [10–18] traces its way back to the seminal work of Rousseau et al. [19], who predicted the underlying 3D MRI volume by alternatingly estimating the slice motion and volume from three orthogonal slice stacks and super-resolving the ﬁnal predicted volume. Le method of Jiang et al. [10] is closely related to [19] but adopts a grid search to estimate the slice motion parameters to overcome the non-convexities of the optimization problem. Gholipour et al. [11] and Kuklisova-Murgasova et al. [13] attribute the cause of poor reconstructions to inaccurate slice alignments and propose reconstruction strategies to combat misaligned slices post-hoc. Uus et al. [18] extend [13] to accommodate deformable motion models as would be required, e.g., in the reconstruction of the placenta. While the focus of our work is on brain reconstruction, our supervised learning approach similarly accommodates diﬀerent motion models (rigid and deformable) by encoding regularity of motion directly into the training motion ﬁelds without additional regularization.   Several SVR approaches extend [19] by reparametrizing slice motion for a more favorable computational complexity or ﬂexibility of the slice motion. Kim et al. [12] propose to lower the cost of motion estimation by aligning 1D lines of intersection between 2D slices. Alansary et al. [15] propose to handle deformable slice motion by partitioning slices into square patches and estimating a separate set of rigid motion parameters for each patch. However, this strategy produces a patch-wise linear approximation of the underlying motion and leads to block artifacts in the reconstructed volume. In our work, we represent slice motion as dense motion ﬁelds to enable straight-forward artifact-free 3D reconstruction.  In optimization-based SVR methods, good initialization of the 3D volume and the slice motion can help mitigate the deleterious eﬀects of local minima in the objective function on the reconstruction. Kainz et al. [14] propose techniques to automatically select a reference slice stack to improve the initialization of the 3D volume. Tourbier et al. [16] initialize the 3D volume with an age-matched template image, which acts as prior knowledge in the reconstruction framework. By contrast, we task our fully convolutional network model with robustly determining slice motion in the presence of image non-convexities, allowing it to dispense with templates and produce subject- and pathology-speciﬁc reconstructions. 2.2. Learning-Based Approaches  Currently, the majority of machine-learning-based SVR methods [20–25] predict the position parameters of slices (9

 numbers) within the underlying MRI volume by using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN). Le predicted position parameters are then used to warp the slices and recover the underlying MRI volume. Le CNN model of Hou et al. [20] consists of the convolutional layers of VGG-16 pre-trained on ImageNet [44] and a dense connected head to predict the anchor points (AP) of the individual slices. Yeung et al. [24] extend [20] and predict the position parameters of all slices jointly, introducing an inter-slice attention layer between the extracted features and the output to conditionally predict the motion for each slice given the features of other slices.  More recently, a non-convolutional model for SVR was proposed by Xu et al. [25] in an unsupervised setting using a vision transformer model [45–47]. Although this produces promising results, it scales quadratically with the number of slices due to inter-slice attention computations and requires hyperparameter tuning to balance diﬀerent terms in the loss function. By posing the SVR task as a supervised registration problem within a convolutional framework, we signiﬁcantly lessen the complexity of modeling pairwise slice interaction through convolutional weight sharing and obviate the need for hyperparameter optimization in the loss function.  Le problem of regressing slice position (or even motion) against intensity data is highly non-convex due to the image landscape [19]. While there have been eﬀorts to overcome image non-convexities in learning-based image registration [31, 32], these concerns are not addressed in learning-based pose prediction works [24, 25] and are exacerbated further by separate processing of the individual slices [20]. Posing SVR as image registration allows us to appeal to e.g. [31, 32] to address the fundamentally non-convex nature of SVR. 2.3. Pre- and Post-Processing  SVR techniques typically involve slice pre-processing as a ﬁrst step to reject slices exhibiting considerable intra-slice motion and segment relevant, e.g., the brain, structures from the scan. Anquez et al. [48] propose a method to skull-strip fetal volumes, which can be used also to mask out non-brain structures in MR slices for small inter-slice motion. Tourbier et al. [16] propose to localize brain regions in MR slices by block-matching an age-matched template to the slices then registering the matched regions back to the template. Kainz et al. [49] localize brain regions based on rotation-invariant descriptors for labeling brain. Keraudren et al. [50, 51] use a dense SIFT and random forest classiﬁcation for voxel-level segmentation. Some shortcomings of these methods include high computational complexity [16, 48] as well as the need to handcraft features [50, 51] for segmentation.   Learning-based approaches to fetal segmentation include the methods of Rajchl et al. [52] and Salehi et al. [53], both of which use FCN models [54] to predict foreground masks directly on slices. For post-processing of the reconstructed 3D volume, Xu et al. [55] propose neural volume rendering similar to NeRF [56] to super-resolve reconstructions at an arbitrary resolution. In this work, we additionally train an interpolation network to postprocess the raw reconstructions and interpolate over regions of missing intensities that may appear in the single-stack reconstruction case, producing an artifact-free reconstruction for other downstream tasks. 3. Mathematical Preliminaries 3.1. Slice Acquisition Model  In high-resolution 3D MRI of subjects exhibiting severe uncontrollable motion, fast slice acquisition sequences such as single shot fast spin echo are used to “freeze” the motion in-plane, substantially mitigating motion artifacts compared to multi-shot methods [57]. SVR procedures aim to align an acquired stack of slices thereby removing the remaining (in-plane and through-plane) motion across slices.  Let us denote the coordinates inside the MRI scanner by (𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) and assume a stack 𝑓 of 2D slices is acquired along the 𝑧 axis with spacing 𝑠 from an underlying volume 𝑣. Le model for the acquisition of the 𝑘th MR slice is [11, 19]:  𝑓𝑘(𝑥,𝑦)=𝜀+∫(𝑣∘𝑢𝑘)(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)ℎ(𝑠𝑘−𝑧) d𝑧∞−∞  (1) for 𝑘=1,...,𝐾, where 𝑢𝑘 :(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)↦(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)′ denotes an unobserved slice-varying rigid spatial subject motion, ℎ denotes the point spread function of slice acquisition, and 𝜀 captures all MR-induced errors such as noise, bias, etc.  To discretize model (1), suppose 𝑣 is sampled on a cubic lattice of 𝑁3 points and 𝑓𝑘 on a 2D lattice of 𝑁2 points. We can write the discretized model (up to random noise) as  𝐟=[𝐟1;...;𝐟𝐾]∈ℝ𝑁2𝐾,   𝐟𝑘=𝐇𝑘𝐔𝑘𝐯∈ℝ𝑁2, (2) in which 𝐔𝑘 and 𝐇𝑘 represent discretizations of (∘𝑢𝑘) and ℎ(𝑠𝑘− ⋅), respectively. In the small motion regime, we can further appeal to Taylor’s approximation and deﬁne  𝐔𝑘𝐯=𝐯+[𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠(𝐯𝑥),𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠(𝐯𝑦),𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠(𝐯𝑧)]𝐒𝐮𝑘, (3) in which 𝐒𝐮𝑘 represents the expansion of the coeﬃcients of motion 𝐮𝑘 in a basis 𝐒 and 𝐯{𝑥,𝑦,𝑧} are the respective spatial derivatives of the 3D volume. We accommodate deformable motion models by setting 𝐒 to the identity matrix, in which case, 𝐮𝑘 denotes the vectorization of a 3D motion ﬁeld. 3.2. Classical SVR Methods  For brevity, let us write 𝐔=[𝐇1𝐔1;...;𝐇𝐾𝐔𝐾] and the associated motion parameters as 𝐮=[𝐮1;...;𝐮𝐾]. We can write the SVR problem with three orthogonal stacks as  minimize   𝐷(𝐮{1,2,3},𝐯{1,2,3})=‖𝐔1𝐯1−𝐟1‖22            +‖𝐔2𝐯2−𝐟2‖22+‖𝐔3𝐯3−𝐟3‖22 subject to  𝐯1−𝐯2 = 𝐯2−𝐯3 = 𝐯3−𝐯1 = 𝟎 (4) in which 𝐮{1,2,3} denote the parameters of motion in each of  the stacks. Contrast-invariant loss functions such as mutual

 information loss [58] are also popularly used in place of the quadratic one shown here for simplicity. Here, we introduce optimization variables 𝐯{1,2,3} with equality constraints as opposed to a single variable 𝐯 to facilitate solving (4) using alternating optimization strategies similarly to [17, 19].  A simple alternating optimization strategy which does not introduce dual variables is to relax the equality constraints to the quadratic penalty  𝑅(𝐯{1,2,3})=‖[𝐯1,𝐯2,𝐯3]−[𝐯2,𝐯3,𝐯1]‖22 (5) and optimize the relaxation  𝐽(⋅)=𝐷(𝐮{1,2,3},𝐯{1,2,3})+𝜆𝑅(𝐯{1,2,3}), (6) in which 𝜆 is a parameter controlling the relative weights of the data ﬁdelity term 𝐷 and the coupling term 𝑅. Objective (6) in fact corresponds to the objective implicitly optimized by Rousseau et al. [19] when the mutual information loss is used in the data ﬁdelity term 𝐷. Optimizing (6) using block coordinate descent yields updates for 𝐯1,𝐮1,𝐯2,𝐮2, 𝐯3 and 𝐮3, where the 3D reconstructions (𝑣-update) and the motion parameters (𝑢-update) of each stack are updated in turn with the other two reconstructions ﬁxed at each turn.  In the 𝑛th iteration of the block coordinate descent, the 𝑣-update step for a given stack amounts to computing  𝐯𝑛←(𝐔𝑛∗𝐔𝑛+2𝜆𝐈)−1 (𝐔𝑛∗𝐟𝑛+2𝜆𝐯̅̅̅̅𝑛), (7) in which 𝐯𝑛 and 𝐟𝑛 denote the reconstruction and 2D slices of the 𝑛%3rd stack, respectively, and 𝐯̅̅̅̅𝑛 denotes the average reconstruction from the two stacks orthogonal to 𝐯𝑛. We can interpret this update as a reconstruction of a new 3D volume from a weighted sum of the last average 3D reconstruction and warped slices, followed by Wiener-deconvolution. Lis interpretation of the 𝑣-update will guide our construction of a fully convolutional network later in Sec 3.3.   Algebraically, (𝐔,𝐔∗) deﬁne an adjoint pair of warping operators, which we will refer to as “slicing” and “splatting” respectively [59]. In the case where there is injective motion relating a slice stack 𝐟𝑛 to a 3D volume 𝐯, we can obtain 𝐟𝑛 by “slicing” 𝐯 with 𝐔𝑛 and obtain 𝐯 by “splatting” 𝐟𝑛 with 𝐔𝑛∗. Figure 3 illustrates the two adjoint warping operators in the discrete case when multi-linear interpolation weights are used for fractional slicing and splatting.  Le 𝑢-update for the motion of the 𝑘th slice in a stack is  𝐮𝑘𝑛←(𝐒∗𝐕𝑘𝑛∗𝐕𝑘𝑛𝐒)−1𝐒∗𝐕𝑘𝑛∗(𝐇𝑘𝐯𝑛−𝐟𝑘𝑛), (8) in which 𝐕𝑘𝑛=𝐇𝑘[𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠(𝐯𝑥𝑛),𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠(𝐯𝑦𝑛),𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠(𝐯𝑧𝑛)], with the 𝐯{𝑥,𝑦,𝑧}𝑛 denoting the respective spatial derivatives of the given 3D volume reconstructed in the (𝑛−1)th iteration.  In practice, subject motion in an MR slice likely exceeds one voxel in magnitude but the linear model of warping (3) stays valid only if the slice is ﬁrst blurred at the scale of the motion. Due to this, motion is often estimated on a pyramid in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner, using the motion ﬁeld estimated at coarser levels to initialize motion at ﬁner ones [60]. MRI acquisitions also suﬀer from a bias ﬁeld due to non-uniform main magnetic ﬁeld and radiofrequency coils, introducing a global intensity shift between the unknown volume and the slices. A key challenge in optimization-based SVR methods is determining, at each scale, motion in the presence of bias and extreme slice artifacts. Mistaking either for motion can quickly lead to pitfalls of local minima in the optimization objective especially at coarse scales. However, it is diﬃcult to hand-craft a reconstruction pipeline which can overcome image non-convexities due to sheer numbers of acquisition-speciﬁc design choices to be made (e.g., non-linear ﬁlters). 4. Fully Convolutional SVR  Using a FCN model for SVR enables us to bypass hand-crafted acquisition-speciﬁc reconstruction pipelines as well as numerical optimization. Rather than formulating SVR as the prediction of absolute slice coordinates in 3D space as is typically done in other learning-based methods [28–32], we cast SVR as the registration of some unobserved 3D volume to an observed stack of 2D slices. We train a FCN model to predict motion relating the slices to a 3D volume given only the slices as input, producing a 3D volume as a by-product of registration. Conceptually, this is similar to the problem of monocular depth estimation [40–43], where one’s goal is to predict disparity (motion along the epipolar line) relating a single 2D image to the depth of the underlying 3D scene. 4.1. Neural Network Architecture  CNN architectures such as those used in semantic image segmentation can produce suboptimal outcomes for motion estimation tasks if the motion is large or images exhibit ﬁne texture [33–39]. While fully convolutional networks such as the U-Net [54] are endowed with a multi-scale architecture and could theoretically estimate motion in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner, using convolution kernels to parameterize warping

In splatting (bottom), the same motion vector endpoints deﬁne coordinate locations in a ﬁxed image to push data to. Multi-linear weights are used for fractional splatting and slicing, guaranteeing diﬀerentiability w.r.t grid data.

 (space-varying transforms) is inherently ineﬃcient, both in terms of parametrization and computation; see, e.g., [33, 39].  Our network model (Figure 4) bears similarities to those used in pairwise image registration [28–32], which predict image motion by processing the image pair across multiple levels of convolutions. Lese network models are typically equipped with warping layers between adjacent levels such that only the residual motion needs to be estimated at every level. Notionally, the slice stack assumes the role of a ﬁxed image while the 3D volume, which we seek to estimate, can be seen as a moving image. As discussed in Sec. 3.2, we can obtain the features of the 2D slices (ﬁxed image) by slicing the features of the 3D volume with the estimated motion. To obtain the features of the 3D volume, we splat the features of the slice stack using the same motion estimate.  Note that in our case, only the ﬁxed image (slice stack) is given, so the downward transform needs to process only the ﬁxed image. Le upward transform synthesizes ﬁxed image features by unpooling lower-resolution ones, concatenating them with the skip features and processing them via a series of convolutions. Le moving image (or 3D volume) features are synthesized in parallel by unpooling their low-resolution counterparts, concatenating them with the splattings of skip features and processing them via convolutions. Le moving image features are ﬁnally sliced, concatenated with the ﬁxed image features and processed using a series of convolutions to output residual slice motion, which is added to the lower-resolution motion that was used during splatting and slicing.  In terms of implementation, both the slice stack and the 3D volume features are seen as (B,C,D,H,W) tensors, where the D dimension acts as the slicing dimension in the case of slice stack features. 3D volume features are processed using convolution and pooling kernels of shape (3,3,3) and (2,2,2) respectively, while slice features are processed using kernels of shapes (1,3,3) and (1,2,2), respectively, so that each slice can be processed independently. Within the residual motion extraction stages, the ﬁrst convolutions are performed with kernels of shape (4,3,3) and strides of (4,1,1) since slices are internally represented as 3D slabs with thickness of 4 voxels and the motion needs to be regularized across each slab. We handle diﬀerent slice spacings in real data by scaling the 2D input slices to a 4:1 slab thickness to voxel spacing ratio.  4.2. Rigid Motion-Compensating Loss  Inexact positioning of subjects in MRI scanners typically introduces a global subject oﬀset (rotations and translations) in the acquired slices. For reconstruction, however, we need only recover the motion of the slices relatively to each other ignoring global shifts. To ensure that we penalize prediction errors only in the relative slice motions, we compensate for any global rigid motion shift that may exist in our predicted motion stack before computing the training loss against the prediction target. Assuming an MSE training objective, we can express our motion-compensating training loss between the predicted 𝐮 and ground truth 𝐲∈ℝ𝑁×3 motion ﬁelds as  𝓛(𝐮,𝐲)=min[𝐑,𝐭]‖𝐮+𝐩−(𝐲+𝐩)𝐑−𝐭‖𝐹2, (9) in which 𝐑 represents a 3×3 rotation matrix, 𝐭 represents a 1×3 translation vector, and 𝐩∈ℝ𝑁×3 is a matrix of voxel coordinates. In words, this loss ﬁrst performs a global rigid alignment between the point clouds 𝐮+𝐩 and 𝐲+𝐩, such that only the non-rigid motion component between the two point clouds is penalized. Loss 𝓛 reduces to the usual MSE loss in the absence of global rotation 𝐑 and translation 𝐭.  To solve the optimization problem (9), we ﬁrst minimize the unconstrained version of problem (9) over the space of all [𝐑,𝐭]∈ℝ3×4 to obtain a minimizer [𝐑′,𝐭⋆], then factor 𝐑′ into its rotation and shear matrices as 𝐑′=𝐑⋆𝐒⋆. From the singular value decomposition 𝐑′=𝐔𝚺𝐕∗, we see that  𝐑⋆=𝐔sign(𝚺)𝐕∗,𝐒⋆=𝐕abs(𝚺)𝐕∗, (10) a factorization known as the polar decomposition [61]. Le resulting rotation matrix 𝐑⋆ is the minimum mean squared- error approximation of 𝐑′, and consequently, the solution of the original rigid motion-constrained problem (9) is given by the pair [𝐑⋆,𝐭⋆]. Le loss 𝓛(𝐮,𝐲) is then backpropagated and the weights of our SVR network model updated. Figure

Interpolating Reconstructions  In general, a 3D volume reconstructed from a single slice stack can contain holes if regions of the underlying volume are missed in all slice acquisitions due to subject motion. In comparison with natural images, MR scans typically exhibit a limited diversity in imagery and have a strong prior on the distribution of underlying 3D volumes. Lis justiﬁes the use of interpolation techniques to ﬁll holes in reconstructions to satisfy regularity constraints (e.g., on pathology). We turn to a fully convolutional interpolation model trained in advance on (true reconstruction, volume) pairs. True reconstructions (with holes) can be obtained readily at train time by warping slice stacks with ground truth slice motion. While the search for the best interpolation network model is not the focus of this work, we ﬁnd that a standard U-Net model trained with true reconstructions as the target and using the mean squared error loss produces good results. Figure 2 (right) shows the training procedure for our fully convolutional interpolator.  5. Experimental Results  We run extensive experiments on both adult MRI stacks (for which ground truth MR volumes are available) and fetal ones, for which only reference volumes are given. For each experiment, we train a SVR network in a supervised fashion on paired (slice stack, motion stack) data and an interpolator network on paired (slice–splat volume, underlying volume) data (Sec. 4.3). Le data augmentation hyperparameters and training details are given in Appendix A. We use the mean squared error (MSE) and the average end-point error (EPE) [33] to measure prediction error; see Appendix A. 5.1. Single-Stack SVR of Adult Brains  SVR experiments on synthetic sliced MRI volumes can reveal qualitative and quantitative characteristics of a SVR method by facilitating comparison across the reconstructed and the ground truth 3D MR volumes. We curate 1100 adult brain MR scans from ABIDE, -2 [62], ADHD [63], COBRE [64], GSP [65], MCIC [66], OASIS [67], PPMI [68], UKB [69] and B39 [70], and split the scans into 1000 training and 100 validation examples. All scans have a 2563 volume with 1mm3 resolution. Le scans are aligned to the Talairach atlas [71] to facilitate slicing along the sagittal, axial and coronal directions; see Appendix A for details on training and sample generation.  Slicing Directions and Reconstruction. Single-stack SVR can achieve diﬀerent reconstruction accuracy depending on the direction of slicing (sagittal, axial and coronal). To study the eﬀect of slice direction on the accuracy of the predicted motion, we train a separate network for each slice direction and plot in Figure 6, the validation MSE and Endpoint Error of the motion predicted by each network. Le ﬁnal validation error attained is the lowest for sagittal stacks at 0.89 (MSE) and the highest for axial stacks at 1.33 (MSE). Such a slight increase in the prediction error for axial stacks most likely stems from fewer “corner” features to track and align in axial slices, leading to a less precise alignment. Motion Prediction Error. We plot distributions of the per- subject errors of the predicted motion stacks across 500 held-out scans in Figure 7. As expected from the validation error curves seen in Figure 6, sagittal predictions have the lowest median motion MSE and the tightest interquartile range. On average, our predicted motion is accurate to less than a voxel although the PPMI dataset exhibits slightly higher errors. Reconstruction and Interpolation. Figure 8 visualizes the 3D reconstructions obtained using the predicted motion. We align all reconstructions back to the Talairach atlas [71] for comparison across diﬀerent reconstructions. We also include reconstructions with the missing intensity data interpolated using our interpolator described in Sec. 4.3. Le splat results show that our network predicts linear motion ﬁelds without the need for additional linear projections. Le interpolation removes holes as well as slicing artifacts that interfere with downstream tasks such as brain morphometry. Larger holes are seen when splattings are viewed along the slicing axis.

 5.2. Single-Stack SVR of Fetal Brains  Here, we curate 98 T2w fetal brain atlases and reference reconstructions across the CRL Fetal Atlases [72] and FeTA [73] (0.8mm3, aligned to age-matched CRL atlases) and split them into 86 training and 12 validation FeTA examples. We use two real T2w slice stacks from MIAL [16] for test. In the case of fetal SVR, we train a single splat–slice network on all possible slicing directions by applying a random rotation (Euler angles between ±180º) to our training examples. We compare our method with state-of-the-art SVRnet [20] and SV oRT [25]; see Appendix A. Optimization-based methods do not work on single stacks and are not compared against. 3D Reconstruction and Interpolation. Figure 9 visualizes the reconstructions obtained using our predicted motion. We align FeTA reconstructions to their gestational age-matched atlas [72] for comparison across diﬀerent methods. SVRnet [20] completely fails to align slices in most of the cases and SV oRT (v2) introduces large slice misalignments, leading to suboptimal 3D reconstruction with apparent distortion. (Le SV oRT and SVRnet reconstructions are processed using our interpolation.) Our reconstructions are more faithful to the underlying 3D volumes up to ambiguities from slicing. Le last two rows visualize reconstruction of the two real MIAL acquisitions for which no ground truth exists and motion is smaller. Unlike SVRnet, the proposed method generalizes to real acquisitions even when the network model is trained on synthetic slice stacks with diﬀerent motion and acquisition parameters, e.g., PSF. See Appendix B for more examples. Quantitative Results. Table 1 lists the prediction accuracy of diﬀerent methods on validation subjects with 4 folds. In addition to motion EPE, we report the slice PSNR, obtained by slicing the true volume with the predicted motion, and the PSNR of the ﬁnal reconstruction. Le three-stack results are from [25], which lists the anchor point errors (APE). In the single-stack case, our method reduces error in the predicted motion by 77.6% and 44.6% relative to the SVRnet [20] and SV oRT (v2) predictions, respectively. Le slice and volume PSNR have also improved but unlike the EPE, these metrics depend on the PSF of acquisition and reconstruction and do not deﬁnitively measure alignment accuracy.

Using the motion stack predicted by our network, we splat slice data to reconstruct the underlying 3D volume (b). Using our pre-trained interpolator, we then interpolate the missing intensities (holes) in our reconstruction (c). ?e result is similar to the true 3D volume (d). We additionally visualize in (b) and (c) the splat and interpolated results when the true motion is used.

 6. Discussion Limitations. Our fetal SVR network is currently trained on automatically segmented brain slices. Training with original unsegmented slice stacks can improve the robustness of our approach against imperfectly generated segmentations. Future Work. Given that our approach predicts dense slice motion for reconstruction, we plan to extend our approach to problems where the acquired slices can undergo deformable motion—e.g. in fetal torso or placental reconstruction [18]—and cannot be tackled using rigid motion SVR. Also, better interpolation networks, such as those that are equivariant to rigid motion, can further improve reconstruction; see [74].  7. Conclusion In brain imaging, slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) is an important computational technique for the imaging of subjects whose motion cannot easily be controlled. Yet, the majority of SVR techniques previously proposed do not reap the beneﬁts of FCN models that have gradually become the mainstay in closely related tasks, such as image registration and segmentation. Le few learning-based SVR techniques resort to pretrained ImageNet classiﬁcation and even vision transformer models. Not only does our work ﬁll the gap in the SVR method development timeline but it also shows that a FCN model can produce state-of-the-art SVR outcomes. Acknowledgments.
