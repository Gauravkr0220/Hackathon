ABSTRACT
A trajectory is a sequence of timestamped point locations that cap-
tures the movement of an object such as a vehicle. Such trajectories
encode complex spatial and temporal patterns and provide rich
information about object mobility and the underlying infrastruc-
tures, typically road networks, within which the movements occur.
A trajectory dataset is evolving when new trajectories are included
continuously. The ability to detect anomalous trajectories in online
fashion in this setting is fundamental and challenging functionality
that has many applications, e.g., location-based services. State-of-
the-art solutions determine anomalies based on the shapes or routes
of trajectories, ignoring potential anomalies caused by different
sampling rates or time offsets. We propose a multi-scale model,
termed MST-OATD, for anomalous streaming trajectory detection
that considers both the spatial and temporal aspects of trajectories.
The model’s multi-scale capabilities aim to enable extraction of
trajectory features at multiple scales. In addition, to improve model
evolvability and to contend with changes in trajectory patterns,
the model is equipped with a learned ranking model that updates
the training set as new trajectories are included. Experiments on
real datasets offer evidence that the model can outperform state-
of-the-art solutions and is capable of real-time anomaly detection.
Further, the learned ranking model achieves promising results when
updating the training set with newly arrived trajectories.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the diffusion of mobile computing and geo-positioning tech-
nologies, spatial trajectories of moving objects (e.g., vehicles or
pedestrians) are being collected at an unprecedented scale [ 23,33].
Such trajectories, in the form of sequences of timestamped loca-
tions, capture rich movement information, and they fuel a range of
urban computing applications, such as movement pattern mining
[31,32], traffic flow control [ 19,30], local-event exploration [ 9,26],
and other urban computing applications.
Given rich movement information, anomalous trajectory de-
tection has important applications in location-based services. For
example, anomalous trajectories can reveal abnormal driving be-
havior. In online taxi platforms, detecting such behavior can help
prevent passengers from being overcharged due to unnecessary
detours [ 3,15]. As another example, anomalous trajectory detection
can help detect and predict events such as accidents and congestion
in road networks [ 18,27], thus providing technical support and
foundation for location-based service providers such as online nav-
igation and intelligent maps. Anomalous trajectory detection refers
to the process of identifying trajectories that exhibit significant
deviations from normal trajectories. A trajectory is considered to
be anomalous if it does not follow a normal route [ 24,29]. Con-
sider the example in Figure 1, where we have a set of trajectories
between a source and a destination. For the purpose of the example,
we assume that trajectory 𝑇1(red) is a normal trajectory, while
trajectory𝑇2(blue) is anomalous as its route deviates significantly
from that of 𝑇1.
While the detection of anomalous trajectories has attracted sub-
stantial attention, two key challenges still need to be addressed:

Figure 1: Illustration of spatio-temporal anomalies. 𝑇1,𝑇2,
𝑇3, and𝑇4are trajectories from the same source to the same
destination.
(1)Inability to detect spatio-temporal anomalies. Most ex-
isting detection methods [ 2,13,15,16,20,24,28,29] focus primarily
on detecting spatially anomalous trajectories. These methods con-
sider a trajectory to be anomalous if it deviates from the route
taken by most other trajectories. These methods do not take into
account temporal differences between trajectories that follow the
same route. However, being able to detect temporal anomalies also
has important uses and should not be ignored. Consider Figure 1.
Trajectory𝑇3(purple) follows the same route as 𝑇1(red). However,
𝑇3takes considerably longer to travel from 𝑝1to𝑝2than𝑇1, i.e.,
6 minutes vs. 2 minutes. Assuming that 𝑇1is normal,𝑇3should
then also be considered as an anomalous trajectory. In real-world
applications, ensuring consistent sampling time intervals is chal-
lenging due to different types of sampling devices and missing data
[25]. Although a trajectory is considered as a normal trajectory
in terms of its location coordinates, the time intervals between
consecutive points may differ significantly from what is seen in a
normal trajectory. Thus, the trajectory is still anomalous. Differ-
ences in sampling intervals and missing sampling points can result
in an anomalous trajectory being indistinguishable from a normal
trajectory. It is therefore important to consider temporal differences
when detecting anomalous trajectories.
(2)No support for updates. As machine learning continues to
advance, many recent approaches to trajectory anomaly detection
employ machine learning to leverage these advances. Machine
learning uses trained models to extract features from trajectories
that can be used to detect anomalies [ 7,15,20]. However, currently
available learning-based methods focus on detecting trajectories
using pre-trained weights and do not provide support for updating
models as new data is collected. Irreversible changes to a road
network such as new roads and traffic regulations, e.g., one-way
lanes, speed limits, and traffic lights, call for updatable trajectory
sets and models. Therefore, it is essential to be able to update models
as new trajectories become available. To achieve high trajectory
anomaly detection performance, it is necessary to achieve efficiently
updatable training that keeps models up-to-date with the latest data,
while avoiding costly retraining of entire models from scratch.
In this light, we propose Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Online
Anomalous Trajectory Detection (MST-OATD) method. In MST-
OATD, a trajectory is represented by a spatio-temporal embeddingsequence. A multi-scale inference strategy is proposed to capture
multi-scale spatio-temporal trajectory features. We partition tra-
jectories into segments of different sizes. The multi-scale strategy
then combines spatial and temporal features of trajectory segments
at different scales. When inferring normal route features, we used a
Gaussian mixture model to model features, where different Gauss-
ian components can represent different types of trajectories. In ad-
dition, inspired by learned indexing [ 12], a learned ranking model
is introduced to learn the ranks of the probability of a trajectory
following a particular type. This ranking model can obtain ranks
with constant complexity as new trajectories are collected, and
the ranks are used to update the training trajectory set when new
trajectories are collected.
Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we propose a
novel anomalous trajectory detection framework called MST-OATD
that can detect both spatial and temporal trajectory anomalies. Sec-
ond, we develop a strategy to capture trajectory features at multiple
scales that is effective and efficient. The relationships between tra-
jectory segments at different scales are used for latent route infer-
ence and generation. Third, we introduce a learned ranking model
to learn the rank of a trajectory based on the probability of following
each Gaussian component. This is used to update the training set at
constant complexity. Finally, we report on extensive experiments
with online anomalous trajectory detection on two large-scale real-
world datasets, finding that MST-OATD outperforms existing meth-
ods. We also find that using the ranking-based update strategy
enables better detection results than other update strategies. Our
code is available at https://github.com/chwang0721/MST-OATD.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Anomalous Trajectory Detection
Existing methods for identifying spatially anomalous in trajecto-
ries can be categorized as either metric-based or learning-based
methods [ 15]. The former typically use hand-crafted features and
predefined metrics such as distance or density to detect anomalies.
An early study [ 6] identifies typical trajectories between locations
of interest and computes the distance of each segment of the target
trajectory to reference trajectories. IBAT [ 29] detects anomalies
by finding the trajectories with the same SD pair as the reference
trajectory and employs the notion of degree of isolation. IBOAT [ 2]
is another isolation-based method for online detection. Learning-
based methods learn the features of normal routes and use these
to calculate anomaly scores of target trajectories. The probabilistic
method DB-TOD [ 24] models driving behavior/preferences from
historical trajectories using reinforcement learning. The RNN-based
method ATD-RNN [ 20] characterizes a trajectory by learning its
trajectory embedding using a stacked RNN. Recently, the genera-
tive sequence model GM-VSAE [ 15] has been proposed. Inspired
by the VAE [ 10], it uses a Gaussian mixture model to represent
trajectory features in latent space. ATROM [ 5] is a probabilistic
metric learning model that focuses on recognizing which type of
anomaly a trajectory exhibits. SafeTrip [ 21] uses several factors
such as distance and speed to estimate the probability of abnormal
safety events in a ride-hailing scenario.
Compared to detecting spatially anomalous trajectories, few
methods focus on the temporal information in trajectories. TPRO [ 34]
 
2981Multi-Scale Detection of Anomalous Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in Evolving Trajectory Datasets KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
develops a time-dependent graph to find popular routes in a given
time period as reference routes. An improved version of TPRO,
TPRRO [ 35] is proposed to speed up the detection process. The
recent time-dependent method DeepTEA [ 7] uses traffic patterns as
a reference and combines these with trajectory patterns. However,
these methods are time-dependent methods, they focus on obtain-
ing normal routes at different time periods, which is different from
our goal of detecting spatio-temporal anomalies.
2.2 Rank Prediction Model
The B-tree and its variants (e.g, B+-tree [ 1]) are the most commonly
used index structures for querying. Given a query, they aim to
return the position of a value within a key-sorted set. A recent study
of learned indexing [ 12] argues that the B-tree can be thought of as
a learnable model. The position of a key within a sorted array can be
approximated as a cumulative distribution function. As a result, the
model can be implemented using machine learning, such as linear
regression. Inspired by this, a similarity search called LIMS [ 22]
uses a polynomial function to predict the ranks of elements in
clusters. In our study, this technique can be used to predict the
ranks of trajectories. Although rank prediction using this method is
not exact due to the uncertainty of machine learning [ 4], the need
for an exact lookup is not necessary in our training set update. Our
focus is on updating distributions rather than performing a precise
search. Therefore, the learned index technique is suitable for rank
prediction in our application scenario.
3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
We proceed to present definitions and formally state the online
anomalous trajectory detection problem.
3.1 Preliminaries
Trajectory Point. A trajectory point 𝑝=(𝑙,𝑡)captures the spatial
location𝑙of a mobile object at a specific time 𝑡.
Trajectory. A trajectory 𝑇=⟨𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝𝑛⟩is a sequence of trajec-
tory points 𝑝𝑖that capture the movement of an object over time.
Given a trajectory 𝑇,𝑇(𝑠)and𝑇(𝑡)denote its spatial and temporal
aspects, respectively: 𝑇(𝑠)=⟨𝑙1,𝑙2,...,𝑙𝑛⟩and𝑇(𝑡)=⟨𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡𝑛⟩.
Trajectory Segment. A trajectory segment 𝑇[𝑖;𝑗]is a consecutive
sub-sequence of trajectory 𝑇=⟨𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝𝑛⟩from𝑝𝑖to𝑝𝑗, 1≤
𝑖≤𝑗≤𝑛.
Route Type. Given a set of trajectories {𝑇1,𝑇2,...,𝑇𝑁}from differ-
ent regions of a city (e.g., downtown or suburbs) and using different
types of roads (e.g., freeways or streets), we use this information to
assign a route type 𝑐to each trajectory.
Trajectory Rank. The rank𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇)of a trajectory 𝑇is defined
as the rank of the probability among all the trajectories that a
trajectory𝑇has, or follows, route type 𝑐. In the example in Figure 1,
we assume that 𝑇1(red) represents a trajectory following the route
type𝑐. Then we assume that the probabilities of 𝑇2(blue),𝑇3(purple),
and𝑇4(orange) following route type 𝑐are 0, 1, and 0.5, respectively.
Therefore,𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇3)=1,𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇4)=2, and𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇2)=3. The
probabilities are calculated based on a Gaussian mixture model, to
be described in Section 4.2.2.3.2 Problem Statement
Online Anomalous Trajectory Detection. A trajectory 𝑇is con-
sidered anomalous if its route deviates significantly from the normal
routes or its time consumption differs significantly from those of
normal trajectories with the same route. The objective of online
anomalous trajectory detection is to acquire knowledge of regular
route patterns and update the anomaly score at each time point.
Section 5 outlines the methodology for calculating the anomaly
score𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑇). The range of the score is [0,1], and𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑇)can
reflect the combination of spatial and temporal anomalies of 𝑇.
4 THE MST-OATD MODEL
We proceed to present the MST-OATD method. The overall archi-
tecture of MST-OATD is illustrated in Figure 2.
4.1 Trajectory Embedding Computation
To extract trajectory features, it is essential to represent trajectories
using low-dimensional embeddings. To achieve this, we compute
spatial and temporal embeddings and perform multi-scale fusion.
4.1.1 Spatial Embedding. We map spatial locations of trajectories
to cells in a uniform grid following a previous study [ 14]. Given a
trajectory𝑇, the spatial sequence 𝑇(𝑠)=⟨𝑙1,𝑙2,...,𝑙𝑛⟩is transformed
into sequence g=⟨𝑔1,𝑔2,...,𝑔𝑛⟩, where𝑔𝑖denotes a grid cell. We
use𝑒𝑔𝑖to represent the grid cell id embedding of 𝑔𝑖. However, grid
cell id embedding is not a complete representation of a trajectory
point because it ignores the positional relationships between the
grid cells. Inspired by Graph Convolutional Networks [ 11], we
generate an aggregation matrix 𝐻for the grid cells:
𝐻=e𝐷−1
2𝑊e𝐴e𝐷−1
2, (1)
where𝐴is the adjacency matrix. In the grid mapping, adjacent
grid cells are cells with common edges and e𝐴=𝐴+𝐼,e𝐴is used to
aggregate features of a grid cell and its adjacent grid cells. Next,
degree matrix e𝐷is calculated as e𝐷𝑖𝑖=Í
𝑗e𝐴𝑖𝑗, and𝑊is a weight
matrix for e𝐴, which is learned to obtain the weights of adjacent grid
cells since the influence of adjacent grid cells vary. For instance,
cells connected by a road, influence each other more than cells
without a road connection.
Therefore, the spatial embedding 𝑒(𝑠)
𝑖can be calculated by mul-
tiplying the aggregation matrix and grid cell id embedding:
𝑒(𝑠)
𝑖=𝐻𝑒𝑔𝑖=e𝐷−1
2𝑊e𝐴e𝐷−1
2𝑒𝑔𝑖 (2)
Based on the method above, the spatial trajectory 𝑇(𝑠)can be
embedded as a sequence of vectors e(𝑠)=⟨𝑒(𝑠)
1,𝑒(𝑠)
2,...,𝑒(𝑠)
𝑛⟩.
4.1.2 Temporal Embedding. Compared to the spatial embedding,
the temporal embedding is more difficult to compute because the
method used for spatial embedding may fail to capture periodic fea-
tures, which is an important characteristic of temporal information.
Instead, inspired by Time2Vec [ 8], we learn temporal embeddings
using a neural network with a periodic activation function to ex-
tract periodic and non-periodic features. For each timestamp 𝑡in a
trajectory, we represent 𝑡by a tuple𝜏consisting of values for dif-
ferent levels of time units (e.g., dates, hours, minutes and seconds).

where𝑓1(·)and𝑓2(·)are learnable fully connected layers, Fde-
notes a periodic activation function that helps capture periodic
behaviors at different levels without the need for feature engineer-
ing,[·∥·] is the concatenation operator. In MST-OATD, we choose
the𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 function asF, representing periodicity at different time
units. With Equation 3, the temporal information of a trajectory
𝑇(𝑡)=⟨𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡𝑛⟩can be embedded into a sequence of vectors
e(𝑡)=⟨𝑒(𝑡)
1,𝑒(𝑡)
2,...,𝑒(𝑡)
𝑛⟩.
4.1.3 Multi-scale Fusion. A trajectory is a sequence of trajectory
points, and the connections between different segments of a tra-
jectory play a crucial role in representing the trajectory’s features.
As single-scale methods focus mainly on individual points within
a trajectory, they face challenges in achieving a comprehensive
representation of an entire trajectory. Furthermore, it is essential to
integrate spatial and temporal information. To address these issues,
we provide a multi-scale fusion module that effectively captures
spatio-temporal features across multiple scales.
Specifically, a cross-attention module is adopted to fuse spa-
tial and temporal embeddings. The spatial and temporal attention
results ˆe(𝑠)andˆe(𝑡)are computed as follows:
ˆe(𝑠)=Softmax(e(𝑡)𝑊(𝑠)
𝑞e(𝑠)𝑊(𝑠)
𝑘𝑇/√︁
𝑑𝑘)e(𝑠)𝑊(𝑠)
𝑉
ˆe(𝑡)=Softmax(e(𝑠)𝑊(𝑡)
𝑞e(𝑡)𝑊(𝑡)
𝑘𝑇/√︁
𝑑𝑘)e(𝑡)𝑊(𝑡)
𝑉,(4)
where𝑊(𝑠)
𝑞,𝑊(𝑠)
𝑘, and𝑊(𝑠)
𝑉are the weights for spatial cross-
attention;𝑊(𝑡)
𝑞,𝑊(𝑡)
𝑘, and𝑊(𝑡)
𝑉are the weights for temporal cross-
attention; and 𝑑𝑘is the dimensionality of 𝑊(𝑠)
𝑘and𝑊(𝑡)
𝑘. The
trajectory embedding eis then calculated as shown in Equation 5:
e=[(Norm(FFN(ˆe(𝑠))+e(𝑠))∥Norm(FFN(ˆe(𝑡))+e(𝑡)))] (5)
Here, FFN denotes a feed-forward network, and Norm is the Layer
Normalization operation. We use e𝑘to represent a trajectory embed-
ding at scale 𝑘. Specifically, since we have a sequence of embeddings
e=⟨𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒𝑛⟩of length𝑛,e𝑘is computed as follows:
e𝑘=⟨ˆ𝑒𝑘1,ˆ𝑒𝑘2,...,ˆ𝑒𝑘⌈𝑛/𝑠𝑘⌉⟩, (6)where𝑠𝑘denotes the segment size of scale 𝑘,ˆ𝑒𝑘𝑖is the mean of the
values of embeddings in the 𝑖-th segment of scale 𝑘,⌈·⌉denotes the
rounding-up operation, ˆ𝑒𝑘⌈𝑛/𝑠𝑘⌉is the last segment of trajectory 𝑇
because the length of a trajectory is not necessarily divisible by the
size of the segment, which are calculated as shown in next:
ˆ𝑒𝑘𝑖=(Í𝑖×𝑠𝑘+1
𝑗=(𝑖−1)𝑠𝑘+1𝑒𝑗/𝑠𝑘𝑖<⌈𝑛/𝑠𝑘⌉Í𝑛
𝑗=(𝑖−1)𝑠𝑘+1𝑒𝑗/𝑠𝑘𝑖=⌈𝑛/𝑠𝑘⌉(7)
In order to capture the correlation between the segments in a
trajectory, we use an attention layer for embeddings at different
scales, the aim being to compute the attention score of segments in
the same trajectory. The calculation is shown in Equation 8:
˜𝑒𝑘𝑖=Í
𝑗Softmax(𝛼𝑖,𝑗)ˆ𝑒𝑘𝑗, (8)
where𝛼𝑖,𝑗=𝑊𝛼·tanh(𝑊𝑖·ˆ𝑒𝑘𝑖+𝑊𝑗·ˆ𝑒𝑘𝑗);𝑊𝛼,𝑊𝑖, and𝑊𝑘are the
parameters to learn; and ˜𝑒𝑘𝑖is the𝑖-th segment embedding at scale
𝑘after the attention layer.
We use ˜e𝑘to represent the embedding of trajectory 𝑇at scale𝑘
after multi-scale fusion, and ˜e𝑘is calculated using the method above.
Different scales capture different characteristics of trajectories. For
example, smaller scales can capture intricate details such as corners.
Conversely, larger scales are required to capture trajectory features
such as their overall shape.
4.2 Route Inference
To extract spatio-temporal features of the trajectory 𝑇at multiple
scales, we propose an inference network 𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠),𝑟(𝑡)|𝑇)to infer
latent route vectors given a trajectory 𝑇. Here,𝜃denotes the pa-
rameters of 𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠),𝑟(𝑡)|𝑇)to be learned, where 𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑡)are
spatial and temporal latent vectors. To cope with the uncertainty of
trajectories, we model 𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑡)using Gaussian distributions:
𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇∼𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠)|𝑇)=N(𝜇(𝑠),𝜎2(𝑠))
𝑟(𝑡)
𝑇∼𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑡)|𝑇)=N(𝜇(𝑡),𝜎2(𝑡)),(9)
where𝜇(𝑠),𝜎2(𝑠),𝜇(𝑡), and𝜎2(𝑡)are parameters of the spatial and
temporal Gaussian distributions.
The route inference stage consists of single-scale and multi-
scale inference. Single-scale inference acquires latent vectors at a
particular scale, while multi-scale inference combines vectors at
different scales.

4.2.1 Single-scale Inference. We provide a specialized module for
route inference, focusing on a specific scale. Our approach employs
recurrent neural networks (RNN) to enable single-scale inference.
The RNNs operate at each timestamp 𝑡𝑖, taking in the trajectory
embedding ˜𝑒𝑖and generating a hidden state ℎ𝑖as follows:
ℎ𝑖=𝑔1(˜𝑒𝑖,ℎ𝑖−1), 𝑖=1,2,...,𝑛 (10)
Here,𝑔1(·)represents the RNN module, while ℎ𝑖−1denotes the𝑖−1-
th hidden state. Using this method, ℎ(𝑠)
𝑖andℎ(𝑡)
𝑖can be obtained
given ˜𝑒𝑖,ℎ(𝑠)
𝑖−1, andℎ(𝑡)
𝑖−1. We useℎ(𝑠)andℎ(𝑡)to refer to the final
hidden states derived from the spatial and temporal embeddings,
respectively.
4.2.2 Multi-scale Inference. To combine single-scale trajectory fea-
tures, we propose a probability-based multi-scale inference module
for latent route inference. Gaussian mixture models are used to
model the spatial and temporal latent vectors to contend with the
complexity of the trajectories. The parameters of the spatial and
temporal Gaussian mixture distributions at scale 𝑘can be obtained
by performing linear transformations on ℎ(𝑠)𝑘andℎ(𝑡)𝑘:
𝜇(𝑠)=𝑓3(Í
𝑘𝜆(𝑠)
𝑘ℎ(𝑠)𝑘), 𝜎2(𝑠)=𝑓4(Í
𝑘𝜆(𝑠)
𝑘ℎ(𝑠)𝑘)
𝜇(𝑡)=𝑓5(Í
𝑘𝜆(𝑡)
𝑘ℎ(𝑡)𝑘), 𝜎2(𝑡)=𝑓6(Í
𝑘𝜆(𝑡)
𝑘ℎ(𝑡)𝑘),(11)
whereℎ(𝑠)𝑘andℎ(𝑡)𝑘are the final hidden states of the spatial and
the temporal embeddings at scale 𝑘,𝜆(𝑠)
𝑘and𝜆(𝑡)
𝑘are spatial and
temporal parameters at scale 𝑘, and𝑓3(·),𝑓4(·),𝑓5(·), and𝑓6(·)are
fully connected layers. Further, 𝜇(𝑠),𝜎2(𝑠),𝜇(𝑡), and𝜎2(𝑡)are the
multi-scale processed parameters of spatial and temporal Gaussian
mixture distributions. These two distributions contain information
about spatially and temporally normal routes.
Furthermore, since vehicles may travel in different regions of
a city (e.g., downtown or suburbs) and on different types of roads
(e.g., freeways or streets), it is not reasonable to model all trajec-
tories with a single distribution. Similarly, normal trajectories are
different at different times, e.g., morning and evening rush hour
trajectories differ from ones at other times, so it also makes sense to
temporally categorize trajectories into different types. Motivated by
this, we assume that there are 𝐶types of routes both spatially and
temporally. We use a multinomial distribution 𝑝𝜙(𝑐)=Mult(𝜋)
to represent the distribution of route types, where 𝑐is a variable
that determines the type of a trajectory and 𝜋is the distribution
parameter. For each type, a Gaussian distribution is used to model
the latent vector, as shown in Equations 12:
𝑝𝜙(𝑟(𝑠)|𝑐(𝑠))=N(𝜇(𝑠)
𝑐(𝑠),𝜎2(𝑠)
𝑐(𝑠)),𝑝𝜙(𝑟(𝑡)|𝑐(𝑡))=N(𝜇(𝑡)
𝑐(𝑡),𝜎2(𝑡)
𝑐(𝑡))
(12)
Here,𝑝𝜙(𝑟|𝑐)denotes the probability of a type 𝑐route being
traversed by the trajectories, and 𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑡)are the spatial and
temporal latent route vectors. Next, 𝜇(𝑠)
𝑐(𝑠)and𝜎2(𝑠)
𝑐(𝑠)denote the
mean and variance of the spatial distribution of type 𝑐(𝑠), and𝜇(𝑡)
𝑐(𝑡)
and𝜎2(𝑡)
𝑐(𝑡)denote the parameters of the temporal distribution of
type𝑐(𝑡)). The latent vectors 𝑟(𝑠), and𝑟(𝑡)and the route types 𝑐(𝑠),
and𝑐(𝑡)can be inferred from Equation 13:
𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠),𝑟(𝑡),𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇)=𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠),𝑟(𝑡)|𝑇)𝑞𝜃(𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇)(13)Basically,𝑞𝜃(𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇)can be considered as the probability of
spatial type 𝑐(𝑠)and temporal type 𝑐(𝑡)given the route of a tra-
jectory𝑇. Since the trajectory 𝑇can be encoded into spatial and
temporal latent vectors 𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇and𝑟(𝑡)
𝑇,𝑞𝜃(𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇)can also be
written as𝑝𝜙(𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇,𝑟(𝑡)
𝑇). Then,𝑝𝜙(𝑐|𝑟𝑇)can be converted
by the Bayesian formula as shown in Equation 14:
𝑞𝜃(𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇)=𝑝𝜙(𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇,𝑟(𝑡)
𝑇)
=𝑝𝜙(𝑐(𝑠))𝑝𝜙(𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇|𝑐(𝑠))
Í𝐶
𝑖=1𝑝𝜙(𝑖)𝑝𝜙(𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇|𝑖)·𝑝𝜙(𝑐(𝑡))𝑝𝜙(𝑟(𝑡)
𝑇|𝑐(𝑡))
Í𝐶
𝑗=1𝑝𝜙(𝑗)𝑝𝜙(𝑟(𝑡)
𝑇|𝑗)(14)
Therefore, the spatial and temporal latent vectors and their types
can be inferred using 𝑝𝜙(𝑟|𝑐)and𝑝𝜙(𝑐), which are defined above.
4.3 Trajectory Reconstruction
To enable online detection, we design a generation network 𝑝𝛾(𝑇|𝑟),
where𝛾represents the parameters of the network. The distribution
𝑝𝛾(𝑇|𝑟)denotes the probability that a trajectory 𝑇follows normal
routes contained in 𝑟. RNNs are also used to generate trajectories.
Given a sequence of embeddings e<𝑖=⟨𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒𝑖−1⟩and a la-
tent route vector 𝑟, the hidden state 𝑚𝑖is updated as shown in
Equation 15:
𝑚𝑖=𝑔2(𝑒𝑖,𝑚𝑖−1)𝑖=1,2,...,𝑛 𝑚 0=𝑟, (15)
where𝑔2(·)is an RNN to be learned, and 𝑚0is the initial hidden
state, which is also the spatial latent route vector. The 𝑒𝑖at the𝑖-th
step is generated according to Equation 16:
𝑒𝑖∼𝑝𝛾(𝑒𝑖|e<𝑖,𝑟)=𝑝𝛾(𝑒𝑖|𝑚𝑖−1). (16)
With this method, 𝑒(𝑠)
𝑖can be calculated given a sequence of spatial
embeddings e(𝑠)<𝑖and spatial latent route vector 𝑟(𝑠); and𝑒(𝑡)
𝑖can
be calculated given a sequence of temporal embeddings e(𝑡)<𝑖and
temporal latent route vector 𝑟(𝑡).
Using the generation network, the spatial and temporal aspects
of trajectory 𝑇,𝑇(𝑠)and𝑇(𝑡), can be generated sequentially by
𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑠)|𝑟(𝑠))and𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑡)|𝑟(𝑡)).
4.4 Optimization
The parameters to be learned include the spatial and temporal
embeddings, 𝜃for route inference, and 𝛾for trajectory generation.
The training objective is to maximize the marginal log-likelihood
of generated trajectories:
log𝑝𝛾(𝑇1,𝑇2,...,𝑇𝑁)=𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1log𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑠)
𝑖)𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑡)
𝑖), (17)
where𝑁is the number of trajectories used for training. The mar-
ginal log-likelihood is optimized by maximizing the lower bound on
the sum of marginal likelihoods L(𝜃,𝜙,𝛾 ;𝑇(𝑠))andL(𝜃,𝜙,𝛾 ;𝑇(𝑡)).
Appendix provides the details on calculating the lower bound.
5 ONLINE ANOMALOUS TRAJECTORY
DETECTION BY MST-OATD
To detect anomalous trajectories, we use the detect-by-generation
strategy. Given a trajectory 𝑇and latent route vectors 𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑡),
the generative networks 𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑠)|𝑟(𝑠))and𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑡)|𝑟(𝑡))are used to
 
2984KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Chenhao Wang, Lisi Chen, Shuo Shang, Christian S. Jensen, & Panos Kalnis
compute the probability that 𝑇was generated from the latent vector
𝑟. To find the most likely route type in the spatial and temporal
latent space for each trajectory, we compute the probability of the
trajectory following all types, and we select the highest type as
the final type. The anomaly score of a trajectory 𝑇is defined in
Equation 18:
Score(𝑇)=1−arg max
𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)exp[log𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑠)|𝜇(𝑠)
𝑐(𝑠))𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑡)|𝜇(𝑡)
𝑐(𝑡))
𝑛],
(18)
where arg max is the operation that finds the argument that maxi-
mizes the argument function, 𝑛is the length of the trajectory, which
is used to normalize the anomaly score of trajectories with different
lengths, and 𝑐(𝑠)and𝑐(𝑡)are the types of the spatial and temporal
embeddings. Here, we use 𝜇(𝑠)
𝑐(𝑠)and𝜇(𝑡)
𝑐(𝑡)to approximate the latent
vectors of each type.
For online detection, the anomaly score Score(𝑇≤𝑖)is determined
by the log-likelihood at the previous timestamp and the upcoming
trajectory point:
Score(𝑇≤𝑖)=1−arg max
𝑐(𝑠),𝑐(𝑡)exp[log𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑠)

6 EVOLVING DATASET UPDATE
Sections 4 and 5 present the MST-OATD model and its application to
online detection. However, as road conditions change over time and
new trajectories are collected, the pre-trained spatial and temporal
features may not match the current trajectory patterns. Therefore,
a method to update the model with new data is needed.
A natural approach is to update the model weights with a con-
stant number of newly collected trajectories, replacing the oldest
ones. However, this approach is not always optimal. For example,
if all of the newest trajectories are from a particular type, simply
replacing the oldest trajectories may not result in a rapid shift in
the data distribution. Our goal is to ensure that the training and
target data distributions remain consistent, as this allows the model
to be fine-tuned with greater efficiency. To achieve this, we pro-
pose a ranking-based update strategy that prioritizes updates of
the training set based on the spatial distribution of the trajectories.
Since the update process is inherently a temporal problem, we
focus on updating the training set according to the spatial distribu-
tion. More specifically, suppose we have a set of trajectories that
spatially follow a Gaussian mixture distribution with 𝐶components.
As discussed in Section 4.2.2, the probability that a trajectory 𝑇is
of type𝑐in the spatial domain is expressed as 𝑝(𝑐|𝑇)=𝑝(𝑐|𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇),
where𝑟(𝑠)
𝑇is the spatial latent vector of 𝑇. We compute the proba-
bility that each trajectory follows a particular type, and then rank
them in descending order. We place a trajectory in the type with
the highest rank and replace the earliest trajectory in the type with
the lowest rank.Further, considering that our model supports online detection,
the efficiency of updates is also critical. The input to our ranking-
based model is the probability that the trajectory has a particular
type, as discussed in Section 4.2.2, and the output is the rank of
the probability of the trajectory in that type. Traditional search
structures like B-trees can handle this problem with O(log𝑛)time
complexity. Inspired by learned indexing [ 12], it is possible to view
the rank of a trajectory as an estimate of the cumulative distribution
function (CDF). Equation 20 models the relationship between the
trajectory rank 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇)and the probability of 𝑇having spatial
type𝑐:
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇)=𝐹(𝑝(𝑐|𝑟(𝑠)))∗𝑁, (20)
where𝐹(·)is the estimated cumulative distribution function and
𝑁is the total number of trajectories. Specifically, we use logistic
regression to implement the model as follows:
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇)=[1+𝑒−(𝑤·𝑝(𝑐|𝑟(𝑠))+𝑏)]−1∗𝑁, (21)
where𝑤and𝑏are the weight and bias. The use of the Sigmoid
activation function is able to restrict the output to [0, 1], which
is consistent with the output range of the cumulative distribution.
The regression model learns the data distribution by minimising the
squared error of the function. The loss of category 𝑐is calculated
as follows:
𝐿(𝑤;𝑏)=Í𝑁
𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖−𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇𝑖))2, (22)
where𝑦𝑖is the real rank of trajectory 𝑇𝑖. Using this method, the
trajectory rank of 𝑇can be obtained within a constant operation.
The Appendix provides the pseudo-code of evolving dataset update
using the learned ranking method.
7 EXPERIMENTS
7.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets: We conducted experiments on two real-world taxi tra-
jectory datasets, namely Porto1and Chengdu2. Porto contains an
entire year of trajectories from 442 taxis in Porto, Portugal, where
positions are sampled every 15 seconds. Chengdu contains over
1.4 billion trajectory points from approximately 14 thousand taxis
in Chengdu, China from August 3, 2014, to August 30, 2014. In
Chengdu, the sampling rate is non-uniform. In our experiments,
we use a ten-day subset of the Chengdu dataset.
Prepossessing: Following a previous study [ 14], we converted
the underlying geographical spaces of Porto and Chengdu into
100m×100m grids. In Porto, trajectories with more than 50 points
are divided into trajectories with lengths between 20 and 50, and we
also delete at random 30% of the points in each trajectory to make
the durations between points uneven. In Chengdu, trajectories
longer than 100 points are divided randomly into trajectories with
lengths between 30 and 100. Table 1 gives information about the
two adjusted datasets. For Porto, we use the first two months of data
to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of MST-OATD and to
train the ranking model. The remaining data is used to evaluate the
performance with the evolving dataset update algorithm. Similarly,
the first three days of data in Chengdu are used to evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency and to train the ranking model. The

remaining seven days of trajectories are used to update the training
set. For each dataset, we randomly select 80% of the trajectories for
training and 20% for testing.

Ground Truth: In the absence of a label dataset for anomaly detec-
tion, some studies attempt to label anomalies manually. However,
manual labeling is time-consuming and lacks uniform standards.
Instead, we generate anomalous samples according to specific rules.
Following previous studies, we use a perturbation scheme to gener-
ate spatial and temporal anomalies. Specifically, we use parameters
𝛼and𝑑, where𝛼is the fraction of continuous outlier and 𝑑is the
moving distance of outliers. In GM-VSAE [ 15], a spatially anoma-
lous trajectory is generated by moving a part of a trajectory by a
certain distance. However, in this method, the moved part of the
trajectory is not continuous. Our method moves a continuous part
of a trajectory. For example, 𝛼=0.1;𝑑=3means that 10% of a
trajectory deviates by 3 grid cells. It should also be noted that tra-
jectory perturbations affect the timestamps of the trajectories. We
assume that the speed of a trajectory is constant, so as the distance
traveled increases, the time interval will change to keep the number
of trajectory points constant. The proportion of anomalous samples
generated is set to 5% in all experiments.
Evaluation Metric: We use Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC) to
evaluate the performance of anomalous trajectory detection. Since
the anomalous samples make up a small proportion of the datasets,
the positive and negative samples are unbalanced. The goal of the
evaluation of anomaly detection is to evaluate the ability to discover
positive samples, for which PR-AUC is suitable.
Baselines: We consider six existing methods for online anomalous
trajectory detection:
•iBAT [29]. This isolation-based anomalous trajectory method
detects anomalous trajectories by checking how much a tar-
get trajectory can be isolated from reference trajectories.
•SAE [17]. The sequence autoencoder is an RNN-based sequence-
to-sequence model learned by minimizing a reconstruction
error. The anomaly score is also defined based on the recon-
struction error.
•VSAE [10]. The variational sequence autoencoder is a degen-
erate GM-VSAE model, where the latent route distribution
is a Gaussian.
•TPRRO [35]. This method distinguishes outliers from time-
dependent popular routes using a time-dependent transfer
graph.
•GM-VSAE [15]. This Gaussian mixture variational sequence
autoencoder is an RNN-based sequence-to-sequence model.
This method can handle complex trajectory distributions by
considering the latent space as a Gaussian mixture model.
•DeepTEA [7] This is a state-of-the-art time-dependent method
that combines dynamic traffic conditions and trajectory pat-
terns to detect anomalies.7.2 Effectiveness Evaluation
Table 2 shows experimental results on the Porto and Chengdu
datasets. To evaluate the online detection capability, we vary the
observed ratio 𝜌of the trajectories, i.e, only part of the trajectory
are observed during detection. We can find that compared to the
metric-based method iBAT and TPRRO, the learning-based methods
have significant advantages. The proposed MST-OATD outperforms
all baselines. MST-OATD has an average promotion of 18.6% on
Porto and 2.9% on Chengdu compared to the best existing method,
DeepTEA. The average promotion is the mean value of the PR-AUC
improvements over DeepTEA divided by DeepTEA’s PR-AUC in
each set of experiments. For full trajectory detection, MST-OATD
achieves high PR-AUC results even when the offset distance is
small, which means that it is capable of outlier detection even when
anomalous parts are not obvious. For example, when 𝛼=0.2and
𝑑=2, the PR-AUC can be as high as 0.892 and 0.949 on Porto and
Chengdu, respectively. For online detection, we set the observed
ratio to 0.5 and 0.7, which means that only the first 50% and 70%
of a trajectory can be observed. MST-OATD can again outperform
all baselines including two methods that leverage temporal infor-
mation TPRRO and DeepTEA. On Chengdu, the improvements are
smaller than on Porto due to the higher PR-AUC values, making
improvements it more difficult. In addition, the shorter time horizon
of Chengdu limits the use of temporal information.

7.3 Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis
We perform parameter sensitivity experiments on the two datasets
and present our analysis. Two hyperparameters influence the per-
formance of MST-OATD the most: the dimension of the RNN hidden
state and the number of Gaussian components. The trajectory per-
turbation parameter is set to 𝛼=0.1,𝑑=3in the ablation study,
and we focus on the result of detecting complete trajectories. The
number of Gaussian components varies from 5 to 100, and the
dimensionality of the hidden state varies from 128 to 1024. The
experimental results are shown in Figures 3 and 4. We find that the
PR-AUC is highest when the number of Gaussian components is
20 on both Porto and Chengdu. The best detection performance is
achieved when the dimensionality of the hidden state is set to 512
on both Porto and Chengdu.
7.4 Ablation Study
We conduct an ablation study on Porto and Chengdu to assess the
effectiveness of the two modules of MST-OATD. We thus compare
MST-OATD with two variants:

•MST-OATD w/o T: This variant only uses spatial informa-
tion for training and detects spatial anomalous trajectories.
•MST-OATD w/o M: This variant uses the single-scale in-
ference, not multi-scale inference, on both the spatial and
temporal dimensions.
MST-OATD outperforms the two variants, confirming the effec-
tiveness of multi-scale inference and temporal embedding. We find
that temporal embedding has a substantially larger impact on de-
tection performance than has multi-scale inference in general. This
suggests that the combination of spatial and temporal embedding
is most critical to anomalous trajectory detection. Furthermore,
the improvement due to using spatial and temporal embeddings is
more significant when the anomaly distance is short or the anomaly
fraction is small. This indicates that the temporal anomalies of a
trajectory are more pronounced than the spatial anomalies. Multi-
scale inference yields almost the same improvements for each set
of experiments on both Porto and Chengdu.

7.5 Efficiency Evaluation
Figure 5 shows the average run time per trajectory. The efficiency
tests are performed on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. In the
efficiency evaluation, the numbers of Gaussian components of GM-
VSAE, DeepTEA, and MST-OATD are all set to 10. TPRRO and
iBAT are the most time consuming methods as they extract normal
routes first and then compare a trajectory with these routes. VSAE
is the fastest deep learning method because it does not need to
encode trajectories in a latent space as does SAE. Due to the parallel
spatial and temporal generation, the detection speeds of MST-OATDand GM-VSAE are basically the same. However, due to the use of
Gaussian mixture distributions, the detection time is proportional
to the number of Gaussian components, making these two methods
slower than VSAE and SAE. The detection speed of DeepTEA is
lower than those of the other learning-based methods as it needs
to capture traffic patterns before generating trajectories. It is worth
noting that MST-OATD only takes 0.413 ms to detect a trajectory
in Porto and 0.636 ms in Chengdu, which is sufficient for real-time
detection.

7.6 Updatable Training Evaluation
We further evaluate the effectiveness of our ranking-based method
when performing updatable training. Figure 6 shows the PR-AUC
 
2987Multi-Scale Detection of Anomalous Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in Evolving Trajectory Datasets KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
when detecting anomalous trajectories on Porto and Chengdu. We
compare ranking-based approach with two other methods: tempo-
ral update and a pretrained model, denoted as temporal and pretrain
in the figure. Temporal update replaces the oldest trajectories in the
training set when new trajectories arrive, and the pretrained model
keeps the weight of the model unchanged. We also report the aver-
age PR-AUC for the three methods in Figure 6. We can see that our
proposed ranking-based method outperforms the pretrained model
and the temporal update strategy. With the passage of time, there is
some degradation in the effectiveness of the pre-trained model, as
the characteristics of trajectories change over time. However, the
performance of training with temporal updating and ranking-based
updating does not show a significant decline.
8 CONCLUSION
We propose MST-OATD, a multi-scale model for online anomalous
spatial trajectory detection. MST-OATD utilizes both spatial and
temporal embeddings, and a multi-scale inference strategy is de-
signed to improve the performance of the trajectory representation.
MST-OATD can detect both spatial and temporal anomalies and
supports online detection. We also introduce a learned ranking
model to update the trajectory training set based on the distribu-
tion of incoming trajectories. We report on extensive experiments
on two real-world, large-scale taxi trajectory datasets. The results
offer evidence that each component of MST-OATD is effective and
efficient and show that MST-OATD is capable of outperforming
six baseline methods. The updatable training also shows that our
proposed ranking-based update strategy is capable of state-of-the-
art performance. In future research, it is of interest to extend our
model to support other trajectory data mining tasks.

B ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION DETAILS
The marginal log-likelihood is optimized by maximizing the lower
bound on the sum of marginal likelihoods L(𝜃,𝜙,𝛾 ;𝑇(𝑠))and
L(𝜃,𝜙,𝛾 ;𝑇(𝑡)), as specified in Equation 23:
log𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑠))𝑝𝛾(𝑇(𝑡))≥L(𝜃,𝛾,𝜙 ;𝑇(𝑠))+L(𝜃,𝛾,𝜙 ;𝑇(𝑡))
=E𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠),𝑐(𝑠)|𝑇(𝑠))[log𝑝𝛾,𝜙(𝑇(𝑠),𝑟(𝑠),𝑐(𝑠))
𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑠),𝑐(𝑠)|𝑇(𝑠))]
+E𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑡),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇(𝑡))[log𝑝𝛾,𝜙(𝑇(𝑡),𝑟(𝑡),𝑐(𝑡))
𝑞𝜃(𝑟(𝑡),𝑐(𝑡)|𝑇(𝑡))](23)
The lower bound can be converted to the form of Equation 24:
E𝑞𝜃(𝑟,𝑐|𝑇)[log𝑝𝛾,𝜙(𝑇,𝑟,𝑐)
𝑞𝜃(𝑟,𝑐|𝑇)]=E𝑞𝜃(𝑟|𝑇)log𝑝𝛾(𝑇|𝑟)
−E𝑞𝜃(𝑐|𝑇)[𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑞𝜃(𝑐|𝑇)||𝑝𝜙(𝑐))]−E𝑞𝜃(𝑐|𝑇)[𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑞𝜃(𝑟|𝑇)||𝑝𝜙(𝑟|𝑐))],
(24)
where E𝑞𝜃log𝑝𝛾(𝑇|𝑟)denotes the reconstruction error. 𝐷𝐾𝐿(·||·)
is the KL divergence between two distributions. The first term is
the reconstruction loss. It reflects the loss between the generated
and the real trajectories. The second is the category loss, which
is the loss between the distribution of trajectory types and the
multinomial distribution. The third is the Gaussian loss, which is the
loss between the latent vector and a specific Gaussian distribution.C DETAILS ON EVOLVING DATASET UPDATE

The whole process of updating an evolving dataset is shown
in Algorithm 1. The input is the original training set 𝑈and a
newly collected trajectory 𝑇, and𝑈can be divided into 𝐶cate-
gories,𝑈={𝑈1,𝑈2,...,𝑈𝐶}. The output is the updated training
set˜𝑈. First, for each type of route, we calculate the probability
that trajectory 𝑇follows type 𝑐and use the probability to obtain
the trajectory rank 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑐(𝑇)based on the learned ranking model,
a setRis used to store all the ranks of trajectory 𝑇(Lines 1–6).
After obtaining the ranks of each type, we calculate the highest
ranked category 𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥 and add trajectory 𝑇to the subset 𝑈𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥
(Lines 8–9). Using the same method, we calculate the lowest ranked
category𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛and remove the oldest trajectory in category 𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛,
which denotes as 𝑇𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡 _𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛. During the update process, as we
remove the oldest trajectory from the lowest ranked category set
when a new trajectory becomes available, there may be cases where
the lowest ranked category set, denoted as 𝑈𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛, becomes empty.
In such cases, we instead remove the oldest trajectory from the
second-lowest ranked category, provided it is not empty, and so
forth (Lines 9–14). Finally, we obtain the updated training set ˜𝑈
and return ˜𝑈as the result (Lines 15–16).
D EXPERIMENTS
D.1 Implementation Details
We implement MST-OATD using Python 3.10.12 and Pytorch 2.0.1.
Experiments are run on a machine with a 40-core Intel Xeon CPU,
an NIVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, and 128 GB of RAM. The AdamW
optimizer, initialized with a learning rate of 0.002 and decaying by
0.9 after every 2 epochs, is used for model training. The batch size
is set to 1600 for the Porto dataset and 300 for the Chengdu dataset.
The embedding dimension is 128 and the hidden state dimension is

512 in our method, the same settings are applied to the baselines.
We use 3 different scales for multi-scale inference, with scale sizes
of 1, 2, and 4. For training on evolving datasets, the size of the
training set is set to 80,000 for Porto and 200,000 for Chengdu. We
repeat the experiments 5 times with different random seeds and
report the average performance.
D.2 Experiments for longer trajectories on
Porto dataset
To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in detecting longer
trajectories, we clip trajectories to a maximum of 100 points in the
Porto dataset and perform experiments. The preprocessed dataset
contains 1,162,423 trajectories and 37,856,009 points. The perfor-
mance comparison with GM-VSAE and DeepTEA is shown in Table
4. We have two observations: First, our proposed MST-OATD stilloutperforms the state-of-the-art methods, DeepTEA and GM-VSAE,
when the maximum trajectory length is set to 100; Second, setting
the maximum trajectory length to 50 and 100 maintains almost the
same detection performance, indicating that our method is applica-
ble to the detection of trajectory anomalies of different lengths.
