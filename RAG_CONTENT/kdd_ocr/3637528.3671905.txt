ABSTRACT
Adapting large language models (LLMs) to unseen tasks with in-
context training samples without fine-tuning remains an important
research problem. To learn a robust LLM that adapts well to unseen
tasks, multiple meta-training approaches have been proposed such
as MetaICL and MetaICT, which involve meta-training pre-trained
LLMs on a wide variety of diverse tasks. These meta-training ap-
proaches essentially perform in-context multi-task fine-tuning and
evaluate on a disjointed test set of tasks. Even though they achieve
impressive performance, their goal is never to compute a truly gen-
eral set of parameters. In this paper, we propose MAML-en-LLM, a
novel method for meta-training LLMs, which can learn truly gen-
eralizable parameters that not only performs well on disjointed
tasks but also adapts to unseen tasks. We see an average increase
of 2% on unseen domains in the performance while a massive 4%
improvement on adaptation performance. Furthermore, we demon-
strate that MAML-en-LLM outperforms baselines in settings with
limited amount of training data on both seen and unseen domains
by an average of 2%. Finally, we discuss the effects of type of tasks,
optimizers and task complexity, an avenue barely explored in meta-
training literature. Exhaustive experiments across 7 task settings
along with two data settings demonstrate that models trained with
MAML-en-LLM outperform SOTA meta-training approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) and achieved state-of-the-art performance
on a variety of diverse tasks. Recently, LLMs have been demon-
strated to learn in-context [18], without expensive and compute-
intensive fine-tuning. In-context learning (ICL) involves pre-appending
the target sample by carefully selected task-specific exemplars -
which act as conditioning for LLMs on that particular task. Learn-
ing in-context is an attractive proposition as its evaluation only
requires inference. With no gradient updates required, ICL can
potentially improve LLM generalization to new and diverse tasks
with only a few examples.
Even though out-of-the-box pre-trained LLMs show good ICL
performance, multiple avenues of research have demonstrated
improved ICL performance by warming-up out-of-the-box LLMs
[4,13]. A few model warmup techniques for improved ICL perfor-
mance have been proposed recently like MetaICL [ 13] and MetaICT
[4]. The evaluation of such models on unseen tasks proves their
efficacy in generalization. Meta-training usually involves adapt-
ing (i.e., fine-tuning) pre-trained LLMs using a diverse set of tasks,
formatted as an ICL instance by pre-appending exemplars in the
prompts during training. Once the model is meta-trained, the eval-
uation is usually performed on a distinct and disjoint set of tasks,
never seen during training. The process of warming up has been
dubbed as meta-training in these approaches which borrows from
research in classical machine learning literature of meta-learning
which attempts to warm up models for faster adaptation to unseen
tasks.
One of the most commonly utilized techniques for meta-learning
in classical literature is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
proposed by Finn et al . [6]. MAML is formulated as a two-step
optimization problem where the inner loop adapts copies of the
model parameters to various diverse tasks, while the outer loop
updates the initial model parameters involving a second-order gra-
dient update calculated on the adapted parameters. Even though
LLM meta-training approaches [ 4,13] are eponymous to meta-
learning, they do not utilize the two-step optimization framework

en-LLM. The figure demonstrates a single model parameter
(𝜃) update step from parameters at step 𝑖-𝜃𝑖to step𝑖+1
-𝜃𝑖+1. The dotted lines represent the adaptation phase and
the solid lines represent the update. As MetaICL does not
have an explicit adaptation phase, the update happens di-
rectly and with only a limited parameter space explored.
The parameter updates for a single step is calculated using
only a single task. On the other hand, MAML-en-LLM first
explores a wide parameter space using multiple adapted pa-
rameters and subsequently performs the final meta-update
with the second-order gradients calculated from the inter-
mediate adapted parameters.
for meta-training LLMs instead only adapting the model parame-
ters continuously using a mixture of diverse tasks. For all practical
purposes, the proposed meta-training approaches are analogous to
multi-task fine-tuning with added exemplars in the training sample
prompts. Training models in this way does not fully exploit the pa-
rameter space and nor does it benefit from second-order gradients
that guide the direction of meta-updates. In this paper, we propose
MAML-en-LLM (pronounced Mammaliam ), a novel method for
meta-training LLMs. Figure 1 visualizes the differences between
our approach and the most popular state-of-the-art meta-training
approach (at the time of writing) - MetaICL.
Our main contributions are detailed below:
•This paper is the first work to effectively utilize principles
outlined in meta-learning literature and propose MAML-en-
LLM - a novel methodology to meta-train LLMs, specifically
for improving ICL performance.
•We demonstrate that MAML-en-LLM outperforms existing
meta-training approaches on ICL generalization performance
on two commonly encountered settings - when training data
is either limited (low resource) or abundant (high resource).
•We report that models trained using MAML-en-LLM demon-
strate superior performance on the challenging setting of
very few-shot adaptation to unseen domains.
•We present results on design considerations previously un-
explored in meta-learning literature on LLMs, namely - the
effect of number of exploration states (tasks), the role of
optimizers, and the effect of task types on generalization.2 RELATED WORK
2.1 In-context Learning (ICL) in LLMs
In-context Learning (ICL) was first proposed by Brown et al . [3]
as an extremely inexpensive alternative to regular fine-tuning. ICL
requires no parameter updates as the input prompt is pre-appended
with task-specific exemplars which are examples of the specific task
to be performed. LLMs have been shown to perform exceptionally
well when prompted with a few examples of the task pre-appended
in the prompt [ 18]. This behavior was first studied for LLMs in
GPT-3 [ 15]. Subsequent studies have shown that they can even
solve complex problems like math [ 15] and reasoning [ 17]. Why
LLMs are so adept at in-context learning remains an open research
topic that is attracting attention; for example Akyürek et al . [1]
compares their behavior to linear models. Empirical approaches
like [ 21] and [ 10] have demonstrated that types of exemplars are
important for ICL performance.
2.2 Meta-Learning for Generalization
One of the most popular approaches for meta-learning was first
proposed by [ 6] as Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The
goal of MAML was to warmup pre-trained models over a diverse
set of tasks using an inner-outer minimization algorithm to learn a
general set of parameters that can be adapted to new tasks using
only a few examples (few-shot).
The inner loop usually focuses on a set of tasks, while the outer
loop utilizes the learned parameters and the second-order gradient
information from the inner loop to update the model, in turn captur-
ing the direction of gradient updates. Usually, MAML requires the
outer loop to perform a second-order gradient update which results
in a higher computational burden. Even though MAML is effective,
it is not without serious issues; for example, it is known to suffer
from memorization [ 20], which entails the model repeating the
data shown to it during training without learning anything. MAML
has also been shown to be sensitive to training hyper-parameters
and complex strategies have been proposed to enforce stability dur-
ing its training process [ 2]. MAML has also been used with some
success for training language models [ 5,8,11,16] on particular
tasks.
2.3 Meta-training for improving ICL
To improve the ICL performance of out-of-box pre-trained mod-
els, several meta-training approaches have been proposed. We dis-
cuss the two seminal works - MetaICT [ 4] and MetaICL [ 13] here.
MetaICT uses BinaryCLFs and LAMA datasets to create tasks while
also pre-appending human-generated instructions to each task.
MetaICL on the other hand uses a wide variety of disjoint tasks
with no human-generated instructions to meta-train pre-trained
LLMs. Both approaches update the model parameters on a batch
from training tasks continuously - making them similar to fine-
tuning. A recent related work [ 14] attempts to utilize MAML to
train LLMs for improving Prompt Tuning. However, the work is
significantly different from ours - as generalization is performed
on learned soft embedding of tokens and not on model parame-
ters - a vastly different objective from ours which is improving ICL
performance.

Comparision to existing works. We discuss the salient differ-
ences with MetaICL first. MetaICL discards principles of meta-
learning and effectively only uses multi-task fine-tuning to meta-
train their models. Next, MetaICT follows an identical training
process to MetaICL. Even though MetaICT attempts to compare
MetaICT to MAML, they only utilize the first-order approximation
and a single task to update the model parameters in the inner opti-
mization step possibly due to not conducting proper investigation
into a myriad of sources of errors like optimizers and exploration
states. Our work is significantly different wherein, we use second-
order gradients to meta-train models and also provide exhaustive
results and discussions around utilizing MAML-en-LLM for various
types of tasks.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we first go over the standard meta-training proce-
dure for improving ICL performance of LLMs by discussing the
problem setup. Subsequently, we provide a mathematical overview
of current SOTA approaches and our proposed approach. Next, we
provide finer details for MAML-en-LLM and its various components
- task adaptation and aggregated meta-update phases in addition to
detailed optimization perspective.
3.1 Meta-training: Problem Statement
In-context learning is an inference-only method, where exemplars
from the same tasks with expected output values are provided in the
prompt as conditioning for the LLM. During meta-training, a similar
setup is followed where for a given train sample (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖), belonging
to a task C,𝑘samples(𝑥1,𝑦1),(𝑥2,𝑦2),...,(𝑥𝑘,𝑦𝑘)from the same task
Care sampled. The 𝑘samples are pre-appended in the prompt with
the final train sample 𝑥𝑖. The target label 𝑦𝑖is used to calculate the
loss and the pre-trained LLM ( 𝑓) is meta-trained over all available
training tasks Cwith standard classification training objectives ( ℓ).
Mathematically, a parameter update step can be represented as:
𝜃=𝜃−∇𝜃ℓ(𝑓(𝑥1,𝑦1,𝑥2,𝑦2,...𝑥𝑘,𝑦𝑘,𝑥𝑖),𝑦𝑖)∀(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖)∈C (1)
We provide more detail about the exact update methodology in the
next section.
3.2 Model Agnostic Meta-Learning for LLMs
(MAML-en-LLM )
Note that the present state-of-the-art meta-training methods like
MetaICL[ 13] and MetaICT[ 4] perform optimization in line with
multi-task finetuning. Mathematically, MetaICL and MetaICT solve
a single optimization objective:
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝜃∑︁
T𝑖∼𝑝(T)LT𝑖(𝑓𝜃) (2)
On the other hand, MAML-en-LLM aims to learn a generalizable
set of parameters by training a model on a diverse variety of tasks
with two distinct phases - an inner phase which controls the extent
of exploration - adaptation and an outer phase which controls the
magnitude of the update - the meta-update. As a consequence,
MAML-en-LLM can be represented as a bi-level optimization with
an inner update step and an outer (meta) update step where it solvesa dual optimization training objective given by:
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝜃∑︁
T𝑖∼𝑝(T)LT𝑖(𝑓𝜃−∇𝜃LT𝑖(𝑓𝜃)) (3)
3.2.1 Task Adaptation. The inner optimization adapts the pa-
rameters to a set of tasks. To achieve this 𝑛tasks are sampled where
each task is a set of size 𝑘. The model is adapted on each task by
performing gradient descent on the original parameters for 𝑘steps
also known traditionaly as support set𝑆. The number of elements
𝑘in the support set is equal to the number of steps for adaptation
using gradient descent. Intuitively, the higher the number of tasks
𝑛, the greater the exploration of the parameter space. The adapted
parameters are calculated using Equation 4. Mathematically, the
inner loop adapts to a distribution of tasks T𝑖∼𝑝(T)where𝑝(T)
represents a probability distribution over diverse tasks. Note that a
task represents a randomly sampled batch of training prompts as
discussed in Min et al. [13].
𝜃𝑖←𝜃−𝛼∇𝜃ℓT𝑖(𝑓𝜃) (4)
whereT𝑖∼𝑝(T)is sampled from all tasks and 𝜃represents the
model parameters, 𝛼is the learning rate of the adaptation step and
ℓis the Cross Entropy Loss.
3.2.2 Aggregated Meta-updates. The outer update utilizes a
distinct query set𝑄(⊥𝑆)to calculate the gradients with respect to
the adapted parameters. The size of the query set is kept the same
as the support set (i.e. 𝑘=∥𝑄∥=∥𝑆∥). In classic MAML literature,
the same query set is usually used to calculate the meta-update.
However MAML-en-LLM utilizes𝑛different tasks to perform the
meta-updates. For each task the calculated gradients (using the
query set) are collected and averaged to perform a second-order
gradient update on the original unadapted parameter as per Equa-
tion (5). The outer optimization performs the meta-update on the
unadapted parameter based on the second-order gradient updates of
the adapted set of parameters 𝜃′
𝑖𝑠. Mathematically the second-order
update can be represented as:
𝜃←𝜃−𝛽∇𝜃ΣT𝑖∼𝑝(T)ℓT𝑖(𝑓𝜃𝑖) (5)
where𝛽is the learning rate for the outer optimization step.
3.3 Shared Adaptive Optimizer Moments
One of the most significant differences between MAML-en-LLM and
MetaICL is the presence of a dual optimization problem in MAML-
en-LLM. The dual optimization problem poses unique challenges in
LLMs where the choice of optimizers affects generalization dras-
tically. Note that typically, adaptive optimizers (like AdamW) are
preferred over stateless optimizers (like SGD with momentum). For
a typical adaptive optimizer, given gradients 𝑔𝑡at step𝑡, obser-
vations sampled from a batch 𝐵, hyperparameters 𝛽1and𝛽2, two
moving averages are calculated - the first moment 𝑚𝑡and second
moment𝑣𝑡as follows:
𝑚𝐵
𝑡←(𝛽1∗𝑚𝑡−1+(1−𝛽1)∗𝑔𝑡)/(1−𝛽𝑡
1)
𝑣𝐵
𝑡←(𝛽2∗𝑣𝑡−1+(1−𝛽2)∗𝑔2
𝑡)/(1−𝛽𝑡
2)
Note that the optimizer in the inner update is re-initialized after
every meta-update, implying that the moments are re-initialized
as well. This significantly changes the landscape of optimization,

Figure 2: Schematic figure demonstrating MAML training for meta-training LLMs. MAML is a bi-level optimization framework
with an inner update (adaptation) and an outer update (meta-update). In the figure, the green cells represent the input samples
(prompts), the yellow cells represent task labels, blue components represent functions and purple boxes represent model
parameters. Multiple task batches are utilized to compute a set of adapted parameters (equal to the number of tasks) represented
by𝜃𝑖. The outer update utilizes the adapted parameters to compute second-order gradients ( Δ𝜃𝑖
𝑖) using a separate set of task
batches. The final meta-update updates the unadapted parameter 𝜃with an average of second-order gradients ( Δ𝜃𝑖
𝑖) to compute
the next set of updated parameters.
making inner gradient updates contribute disproportionately more
as the training continues for a longer duration, especially near the
minima. To alleviate this problem, we propose optimizer parameter
sharing between the inner and outer optimizers - i.e., constantly
updating shared moving averages between optimizers where only
a single set of optimizer parameters are updated.
3.4 Consolidated Meta-Training using
MAML-en-LLM
Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of the consolidated train-
ing approach and Algorithm 1 details the exact MAML-en-LLM
training procedure. As we utilize 𝑛tasks for calculating the adapted
parameters and subsequently utilize 𝑘tasks for adaptation steps
and calculating meta-updates, we represent our MAML-en-LLM
terminology by MAML-2k-n. Hence, if the size of the support and
query set is 1 and the number of tasks during adaptations are also 1,
theMAML-en-LLM setting will be represented as MAML-2-1. It is
intuitive to see that the meta-update frequency can easily be calcu-
lated as 2𝑘𝑛, hence for MAML-2-1, the frequency of meta-updates
is2. Similarly, for MAML-2-4, the frequency of meta-updates is 8.4 EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Dataset Description
We utilize two datasets with a wide diversity of tasks - CrossFit
[19] and UnifiedQA [7] consisting of total of 142 distinct tasks. We
use the exact same task splits used by MetaICL [ 13], however due
to active developments, we utilize latest versions of tasks. All the
tasks fall in the following 4 categories with increasing complexity:
text classification, natural language inference, question answering,
and paraphrasing. The training tasks and the testing tasks are
ensured to be disjointed. The testing tasks consist of two types
of tasks - tasks with similar domains in training set and sampled
from unseen domains in training set. The statistics of the dataset
splits are detailed in Table 1.
4.2 Training Details
We utilize a pre-trained GPT-2 Medium [15] consisting of 355 mil-
lion parameters for all our experiments. We consider both the stan-
dard models and Noisy channel models [ 12] for evaluation of all
experiments. Training is performed on 8 Tesla V100 GPUs using
Pytorch and pre-trained model checkpoints are taken from Hug-
gingFace. Training time for MetaICL models for 50k steps is about
5 hours, while for MAML-en-LLM models is about 12 hours.

number of tasks is chosen as 1(MAML-2-1) and 4(MAML-2-4). This
implies the frequency of meta-updates is 2and8respectively. We
train both paradigms of models for 50k steps. For both approaches,
AdamW is used as an optimizer. As MAML models require an inner
and outer optimizer, we utilize AdamW for both optimizers with
identical hyper-parameters. As every AdamW’s optimization step
depends on the last gradient update, we copy the inner optimizer’s
last gradient state to the outer optimizer for every meta-update.
The training seed is set as 100. More details on optimizers can be
found in the Appendix5.5.
Inference. We utilize identical evaluation framework as [ 13] for
fair comparisons. The test sequence length is fixed at 256 or 16
exemplars whichever is lower. The batch size is fixed at 16 samples
during inference.
4.4 Comparison of Baselines and Replication
We compare our proposed methodology against a variety of dif-
ferent models and prompt settings. We utilize 2 types of models -
standard models and noisy channel models as proposed by Min et al .
[12]. For standard models, the training and inference procedure
for a given input sample 𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖and exemplars(𝑥1,𝑦1,...𝑥𝑘,𝑦𝑘)is as
follows (Refer problem setup in Section 3.1):

training and inference procedure as a generative problem rather
than a classification task. During training, the labels and prompts
are flipped and reordered, and the target label is appended in the
prompt itself, while the training instance is treated as the model’s
generated output. Mathematically, the training procedure optimizes
the following:
𝜃=𝜃−∇𝜃ℓ(𝑓(𝑦1,𝑥1,𝑦2,𝑥2,...𝑦𝑘,𝑥𝑘,𝑦𝑖),𝑥𝑖) (8)
During inference, all possible target labels are considered and ap-
pended in the prompt, and the prompt with the highest probability
is treated as the correct label.
𝑦𝑖=arg max
𝑐∈𝐶𝑃(𝑥𝑖|𝑦1,𝑥1,𝑦2,𝑥2,...𝑦𝑘,𝑥𝑘,𝑐) (9)
where𝐶represents all possible labels for the task. For both models,
we consider 3 different settings based on the prompt structure and
the model used. We detail the settings below.
•No ICL: The prompt only consists of the target instance( 𝑥𝑖)
and estimates target label ( 𝑦𝑖).
•RawLM: The prompt consists of exemplars ( 𝑥1,𝑦1,..,𝑥𝑛,𝑦𝑛)
followed by the target sample ( 𝑥𝑖) and estimates the target
label (𝑦𝑖). The model used is a pre-trained out-of-box LLM.
Note, for Channel models, the prompt structure is flipped as
shown in Equation 9.•MetaICL: We replicate the exact MetaICL setting by training
the model identical to [ 13]. Please refer to Section 4.2, for
more information.
Replication of MetaICL. We replicate the training procedure of
MetaICL and Channel MetaICL models on the latest versions of the
datasets and on the GPT-2 Medium models. Differently from the
provided approach, we do not utilize 8-bit optimization and mixed
precision training. Our replicated results agree with the reported
results on all the data splits in the paper and even perform better
than the reported results on GPT-2 Medium (Table 11 in [13]).
4.5 Evaluation Criterion and Metrics
To quantify the performance of classification tasks, macro-F1 score
is utilized (Refer [ 13] for details) which is suitable for settings with
class imbalances. For all other tasks prediction accuracy is used
instead. We report the average and worst-case performance on five
random seeds (identical to [ 13]). To compare performances among
various methods for the same data setting, we report the win-rates
ofMAML-en-LLM models. We consider a ‘win’ for all cases where
both the average and worst case performances of MAML-en-LLM
models outperform their counterparts and are significant (discussed
later). The numbers in bold represent the best-performing methods
for each data setting.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
5.1 Experiment-1: Generalization Performance
We evaluate our methodology on two commonly encountered data
settings in practice. These settings are useful to demonstrate the
efficacy of our method on both high and low-resource settings.
Complete Data Setting (High Resource). Comprised of the entire
training set from each task dataset. We utilize the exact same task
and data splits as MetaICL[ 13]. The statistics for training and testing
data are detailed in Table 1.
Limited Data Setting (Low Resource). We sample 10% of training
data from each task dataset utilizing the same dataset seeds. To
combat the bias introduced during sampling, we ensure the propor-
tion of labels in the sampled data is the same as in the complete
data setting, i.e., the sampling is equally stratified (Table 1).
To compare the generalization performance of MAML-en-LLM
and MetaICL, we evaluate first on test tasks in unseen training
domains and next on all test tasks. As ICL is sensitive to the selected
exemplars in the prompt, we consider five seeds while creating
prompts for the test set. The exemplars are sampled from the train
set of the test tasks and performance is averaged. We report both
the average and the worst-case performances over all five seeds.
Significance Analysis. For all reported results, we pay special care
in determining the significance of the result. If both the averageand the worst-case performance are better, we adjudge the result
significant (bold numbers) based on lower standard deviation.
5.1.1 Performance on tasks from unseen domains. We re-
port the performance of MAML-2-1 and MAML-2-4 along with the
baselines as discussed before in Table 2 (a) and (b) on only unseen
domain of tasks. Note that unseen tasks share no task type with the
training set as well as sampled from completely disjointed domains.
Complete Data. We observe that MAML-en-LLM settings outper-
form MetaICL on 5 out of the 7 task settings (win rate of 0.71)
for standard models and 4 out of 7 task settings (win rate of 0.57)
for channel models on complete data setting. For the task settings
where MAML settings do not outperform MetaICL, we observe that
Non-Para→Para on standard models underperforms significantly
(discussed in Subsection 5.2.3).
Limited Data. Similarly, MAML-en-LLM outperforms MetaICL
on4 out of 7 settings (win rate of 0.57) using both standard and
channel models on limited data setting. These results demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach in low-resource settings. For most
other settings MAML-en-LLM performs at par with MetaICL.
Takeaway. The outperformance of MAML-en-LLM on the unseen
task setting implies that our method learns a more generalized
parameter set. This is a direct consequence of MAML-en-LLM ex-
ploring a wider set of parameter space as demonstrated in Figure 1.
 
2717KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Sanchit Sinha et al.
5.1.2 Performance on all tasks. Similar to unseen tasks, we
report the performances of MAML-2-1 and MAML-2-4 settings in
Table 3 (a) and (b) along with the associated baselines.
Complete Data. MAML-en-LLM settings outperform MetaICL on
thecomplete data settings for all the tasks on 4 out of 7 (win rate of
0.57) data settings. Channel models perform much better, beating
MetaICL on 5 out of 7 (win rate of 0.71) data settings.
Limited Data. For the limited data settings, MAML-en-LLM set-
tings outperform MetaICL on 6 out of 7 (win rate of 0.85) task
settings on both Standard and Channel models. As before, MAML-
en-LLM settings significantly outperform or are comparable with
the MetaICL counterparts on most settings.
Takeaway. The results on both complete andlimited task settings
show that even though MAML-en-LLM performs meta-updates
once every 2𝑘𝑛batches, it is insensitive to amount of train data.
This further attests to MAML-en-LLM ’s efficacy and wide use cases.
5.2 Effect of Task Complexity on Exploration
States (Number of Tasks)
5.2.1 Task complexity. We preface the discussion around explo-
ration states by discussing the exact task settings. Note that we have
a total of seven settings out of which - two are classification, one is
natural language inference (NLI) which is similar to classification,
two are question answering (QA), and one is paraphrasing while
the last one is a mixture of all of them characterized only by the
amount of data. We designate the set of Classification and NLI tasks
asless-complex while Paraphrasing and QA are more-complex. As a
direct consequence to task splits, more-complex tasks should ideally
require a wider parameter space exploration while less-complex
tasks should require relatively less exploration.
5.2.2 Complexity directly affects performance of various
exploration states. We utilize MAML-en-LLM on 2 settings - with
1 task and 4 tasks represented by MAML-2-1 and MAML-2-4, re-
spectively. The more the number of tasks, the more parameter space
is explored by the model before performing the meta-update. How-
ever, on the flip side, more exploration leads to slower convergence
to the minima. The trend we observe is that more number of tasks
(MAML-2-4) benefit more-complex settings like QA and Paraphras-
ing, while a smaller number of tasks (MAML-2-1) help less-complex
settings like classification and NLI. (Table 3a,3b). We report results
on the validation set in the Appendix.
5.2.3 Further discussion on performance. Even though the
task settings are chosen keeping in mind the non-overlap of tasks,
not all tasks are created equal. We believe the choice behind the
task selection and splits is not explored in detail in [ 13]. We attempt
to shed light on why MetaICL or MAML-en-LLM do not perform
well on specific tasks like Non-Para →Para. From our experiments,
we observe both MetaICL and MAML-en-LLM on standard models
actually degrade performance from out-of-box pre-trained models
(Refer last column in Table 3a). This observation alludes to the fact
that standard model training of MetaICL and MAML-en-LLM actu-
ally causes some forgetting to the out-of-box pre-trained models by
disrupting model weights out of box. In other words, pre-trained
out-of-box models are already good enough to perform complextasks like paraphrasing. Hence, task type and design need to be
closely monitored to utilize meta-training approaches.
5.2.4 Further discussion on training sets. Non-QA -> QA and
Non-Para->Para require meta-training on a relatively easier subset
(Non-QA and Non-Para sets mostly include easier classification
and NLI tasks), which makes the test sets significantly challenging.
Indeed, Meta-training on these tasks using MetaICL even causes
some forgetting as compared to pre-trained models. Please refer
to Table 3a where RawLM outperforms MetaICL baseline on chal-
lenging data settings. Refer Table 3a where both Non-Para -> Para
(37.26 to 33.1) and Non-QA to QA (39 to 36.71) give a degradation
in performance. This behavior is mirrored in the original paper as
well [ 13]. Hence, the behavior observed using MAML-en-LLM on
these particular settings is not any different from MetaICL itself
and requires further analysis - out of the scope of this paper.
5.3 Effect of Optimizer Choice
Multiple works have demonstrated that optimizers play a crucial
role in the effective training of LLMs. Stateless optimizers like
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) underperform newer adaptive
optimizers like AdamW [ 9] in LLM training. Note that MetaICL[ 13]
utilizes AdamW. However, MAML-en-LLM utilizes a dual optimiza-
tion problem - which requires two separate optimizers for the inner
and outer optimizations. In Table 5, we provide ablation studies
with two different optimizers - one stateless (SGD) and one adap-
tive (AdamW). Due to compute limitations, we sample a 10% subset
of the training and test data across two seeds for both MetaICL
and MAML-2-1. In row 4, we report the performance utilizing a
combination of optimizers for inner and outer optimizations. Under
MAML-2-1, when using stateless optimizers (SGD+SGD), we do
not see an increase in performance. Next, as the inner optimizer is
re-initialized after every meta-update, we use SGD for inner and
AdamW for outer - resulting in a significant increase in perfor-
mance. Note that using a stateless optimizer in the outer loop is
identical to utilizing both stateless optimizers and the performance
is identical to SGD+SGD. Lastly, we report results on using adap-
tive optimizers in both inner and outer optimization steps with and
without moment parameter sharing (discussed in subsection 3.3).
5.4 Experiment-2: Very Few Shot Adaptation
The second experiment involves adapting the meta-trained models
to unseen domains using only a few samples. Setup: We utilize the
training set of test tasks for sampling both the adaptation samples
and their prompts, ensuring that the same target prompt is never
utilized in exemplars. We sample 16 exemplars or 256 sequence
lengths whichever is lower for the prompts. We consider a total of 16
adaptation data points. The model is adapted using the adaptation
training samples for 16 steps (1 pass over all points) with a learning
rate of 1x10−7using AdamW. The testing set remains identical to
the unseen test tasks mentioned in Table 1.
Takeaway: Generalization to unseen tasks is a paramount problem
in LLM literature. We report the results of very few-shot adapted
models in Table 4. Note that the starting unadapted standard and
channel models are identical to the complete data setting. We ob-
serve for standard models, MAML-en-LLM settings outperform
MetaICL on 5 out of 7 tasks (win rate of 0.71). Similarly, channel

→NLI)
models outperform MetaICL on 5 out of 7 tasks (win rate of 0.71).
Once again we observe that generalization to unseen domains of
tasks is better captured by MAML-en-LLM as the model explores
wider parameter space during training, thus learning better pa-
rameter initializations for adaptation. This behavior has been well
documented in Meta-learning literature like [2, 6].
5.5 Runtime Analysis
In this section, we detail some practical considerations to keep
in mind during meta-training models using MAML-en-LLM. For
reference, Figure 1 details the training procedure schematically.
•Model sizes: Let us assume the size of the computation
graph is in order of the number of parameters of the model
in question. Assume 𝑆(𝜃)=𝑐∗𝑂(𝜃)=𝑂(𝜃)to be the size
of the computational graph during training. For MetaICL, as
there is no adaptation phase, the gradients are computed only
once. Hence at any given instance, the maximum memory
utilization of the computational graph is 2∗𝑆(𝜃), where the
only values are the present parameter state and the gradients.
However, for MAML-en-LLM, after the adaptation step the
number of parameters in the computational graph are 𝑆(𝜃)(unadapted params), 𝑘∗𝑆(𝜃)(𝑘is number of tasks), 𝑆(𝜃)
(meta-update) which is a total of (𝑘+2)∗𝑆(𝜃)parameters.
Hence the memory utilization is a linear function of the
number of tasks. Thus, it is important to control the number
of tasks as per the meta-training strategy and the type of
tasks themselves. For our purpose, GPT-2 Medium with 355
million parameters is used.
•Optimizer states :MAML-en-LLM as opposed to MetaICL
utilizes 2 optimizers for the adaptation and the meta-update
steps respectively. Even though it might be tempting to uti-
lize state-less optimizers like SGD and Adam, LLM training
has been shown to work better when the updates are con-
ditioned on the last gradient state such as with adaptive
optimizers like AdamW [ 9]. Hence, we utilize AdamW for
both adaptation and meta-updates (Optim 1 and Optim 2
in Figure 1). However, after each update step, we copy the
last optimizer state back and forth to both optimizers to
smoothen out the training procedure.
6 LIMITATIONS
•Unstable Training/Performance: Due to the dual opti-
mization procedure of MAML-based approaches, the training
procedure is bumpy and non-smooth, making the training
and validation losses spiky. Observation has been noted[2].
•Task complexity: Based on our observations, we recom-
mend utilizing MAML-2-1 for tasks that benefit from faster
convergence and low-param space exploration (Classifica-
tion, NLI) which are less complex than tasks that require
larger param space exploration (Paraphrasing, QA)
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel method MAML-en-LLM that
meta-trains pre-trained out-of-box models using the principles pro-
posed in meta-learning literature. We demonstrated that MAML-en-
LLM explores a much wider parameter space than current SOTA
meta-training methods like MetaICL and MetaICT due to adaptation
to multiple sets of parameters before the actual meta-update. Empir-
ically, MAML-en-LLM outperforms MetaICL on both standard and
channel models on an extensive set of tasks in both seen and unseen
domains. Subsequently, we also demonstrate that models trained
using MAML-en-LLM can be quickly adapted in a few-shot manner
to a set of tasks in the unseen domain. Overall, MAML-en-LLM
outperforms MetaICL on both performance and generalization.
