Abstract
Data collected in the real world often encapsulates historical dis-
crimination against disadvantaged groups and individuals. Existing
fair machine learning (FairML) research has predominantly focused
on mitigating discriminative bias in the model prediction, with far
less effort dedicated towards exploring how to trace biases present
in the data, despite its importance for the transparency and inter-
pretability of FairML. To fill this gap, we investigate a novel research
problem: discovering samples that reflect biases/prejudices from
the training data.. Grounding on the existing fairness notions, we
lay out a sample bias criterion and propose practical algorithms
for measuring and countering sample bias. The derived bias score
provides intuitive sample-level attribution andexplanation of
historical bias in data. On this basis, we further design two FairML
strategies via sample-bias-informed minimal data editing. They can
mitigate both group and individual unfairness at the cost of
minimal or zero predictive utility loss. Extensive experiments
and analyses on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our methods in explaining and mitigating unfairness.

1 Introduction
Machine learning techniques are increasingly used in high-stake
scenarios such as loans, recruitment, and policing strategies. De-
spite the benefits of automated decision-making, data-driven mod-
els are susceptible to biases that render their decisions potentially
unfair, reflecting racism, ageism, and sexism [ 10,41]. With the
increasing demand for equitable and responsible use of artificial
intelligence, Fair Machine Learning (FairML) has gained significant
attention in both research and practice [6, 31].
Existing FairML research mainly focuses on how to devise learn-
ing algorithms to guarantee that the model has no prejudice or
favoritism toward an individual or group based on their inherent
or acquired characteristics [ 41]. In essence, the bias in machine
learning models is inherited from their training data: even with
perfect sampling and feature selection, data collected from the real
world inevitably contains historical bias [ 41,54], which is a result
of the pre-existing biases and socio-technical issues in the world
[19,32]. For example, discrimination against female/minority by
loan providers recorded in databases can be inherited by the learn-
ing model for loan screening, and eventually leads to outcomes
that are unfavorable for female/minority applicants [ 22]. Similar
situations arise in various domains of daily living, such as employ-
ment, housing, insurance, credit scoring, and many more [ 19,22].
Identifying and understanding such biases encoded in the data is
therefore crucial for achieving more transparent, interpretable, and
equitable machine learning systems.

To this end, we delve into an under-explored aspect of FairML:
discovering samples that reflect biases/prejudices from the training
data. Practically, this can assist human experts in understanding the
bias within the data, locating and scrutinizing discriminatory sam-
ples, and developing more trustworthy FairML techniques based
on these insights. With its root in social, ethical and legal literature
on fairness [ 8,17,20,54], we posit that a good sample bias criterion
should be able to robustly capture various prejudices encoded in the
data, whether targeted towards specific individuals or demographic
groups. Grounding on this, we consider a sample exhibits bias if its
comparable samples from other groups receive different andcredible
treatments. As a practical example, we consider a female applicant
being rejected for a loan as being discriminated if (1) a male appli-
cant with similar conditions gets the loan ( different ), and (2) the
approval is not by chance ( credible ). Intuitively, it captures both
individual-level and group-level fairness and prevents incidental
events or noise in the real world from disturbing bias estimates.
Our criterion is grounded in the overarching principles behind
popular algorithmic fairness notions such as group [ 11,17], indi-
vidual [ 17,27], and counterfactual fairness [ 35], but without de-
pending on intricate causal modeling or requiring additional expert
knowledge. Existing fairness research also largely overlooks the
imperfections in the data: due to various unexpected subjective
and objective factors in data generation and processing, the data
collected from the real world often contains unavoidable noise
and errors [ 21,25], which can significantly disturb the FairML pro-
cess [ 57,58]. To address this, we introduce sample credibility in
FairML to obtain robust bias estimates, and practical algorithms are
further proposed for estimating sample bias and credibility. Our
bias criterion is also self-explanatory: the bias of a sample can be
naturally explained by corresponding other-group samples that
receive different and credible treatments, which provides further
insights for human experts to inspect the bias in the data.
Our bias and confidence estimation require a sample similarity
metirc. In principle, any reasonable similarity measure on the fea-
ture space can seamlessly integrate with our framework. However,
due to the complexity of real-world data, practical applications
typically require human experts to manually design/annotate sim-
ilarities for each task, resulting in significant costs [ 18,20,43].
To this end, we propose a practical and intuitive similarity mea-
surement that requires the minimal user input based on two key
concepts: (i) creating a comparability graph to capture local simi-
larities between input samples; and (ii) applying graph proximity
measures on the comparability graph to capture global similarities
reflecting the manifold structure of the input data. This approach
yields localized, intuitive, and interpretable sample similarities to
better support practical bias attribution and interpretation.
Finally, we explore the potential of mitigating unfairness based
on bias attribution. We propose two strategies to mitigate unfairness
with informed minimal data editing, namely unfairness removal and
fairness augmentation. By discarding a small fraction of samples
with high bias or augmenting samples with low bias, the proposed
methods can mitigate group and individual unfairness at the cost
ofminimal or zero predictive utility loss. Extensive experiments
and analyses on multiple real-world FairML tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed unfairness mitigation strategies.Figure 1 shows the concept and applications of AIM. To sum up,
ourAIM (Bias Attribution, Interpretation, Mitigation) framework
can assist practitioners in addressing the following problems:
•Attribution: Which samples exhibit bias?
•Interpretation: Why is a particular sample biased?
•Mitigation: How to counter unfairness with auditable data
editing and minimal utility loss?
Our contributions are 3-fold:
(1)Problem Formulation. We formulate a novel problem of
identifying samples that encode discrimination in the data,
which is crucial for achieving more transparent FairML.
(2)Algorithm Design. We propose a novel framework AIM.
Armed with credibility-aware sample bias criterion and sim-
ilarity based on user-defined comparable constraints, AIM
offers robust, practical, and self-explanatory sample-level
bias attribution. The results further support efficient unfair-
ness mitigation with minimal data editing and utility loss.
(3)Experimental Evaluation. We provide comprehensive ex-
periments and analyses on real-world datasets to validate the
effectiveness of AIM in explaining and mitigating unfairness.
2 Preliminaries
Notations. Real-world data usually contains both numerical (e.g.,
age, income) and categorical features (e.g., job type, residence). In
this paper, we consider the attribute vector xcontains numerical
features with real values r=[r(1),r(2),···,r(𝑛𝑟)], and categorical
features with discrete values d=[d(1),d(2),···,d(𝑛𝑑)], where
𝑛𝑟/𝑛𝑑denote the number of numerical/categorical features. We use
rx/dxto denote the numerical/categorical part of feature vector
x. For simplicity, we assume numerical features rcontain values
in[0,1]after some scaling/normalization operation. We consider
binary labels and demographic groups following the common set-
ting in algorithm fairness [ 6,10,41]. Without loss of generality, we
consider label space Y:={0,1}and sensitive group membership
spaceS:={0,1}, with positive value representing the favorable
outcome/treatment (e.g., loan approval) and the advantaged group
(e.g., gender/race with favoritism). A dataset with 𝑛samples is de-
noted asD:{(x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖)|𝑖=0,1,···,𝑛}with the𝑖-th data instance
inDas(x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖). We provide the problem definition as follows:
Problem 2.1 (Unfairness Attribution, Interpretation, Mitigation ).
Given a tabular dataset D:{(x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖)|𝑖=0,1,···,𝑛}containing
historical discrimination, we aim to solve the following problems.
Unfairness Attribution : quantifying the historical bias carried by
each instance(x,𝑦,𝑠).Unfairness Interpretation : providing samples
as justifications to explain why a specific instance (x,𝑦,𝑠)is bi-
ased/unbiased. Unfairness Mitigation : debiasing the dataset such
that the predictive model trained on the debiased Dinherits as little
discrimination as possible while retaining the predictive utility.
3 Methodology
In this section, we present our AIM (Bias Attribution, Interpretation,
Mitigation) framework. We first introduce our sample bias crite-
rion for unfairness attribution andinterpretation, then discuss its
rationales and connections to existing fairness notions. In short,
 
2015AIM: Attributing, Interpreting, Mitigating Data Unfairness KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
our criterion captures both individual-level and group-level un-
fairness and prevents incidental events or noise in the real world
from disturbing bias estimates. Then, we propose a novel similarity
measure based on user-defined comparable constraints to support
reasonable attribution and interpretation of sample bias. It allows
practical, configurable, and interpretable similarity computing in
complex heterogeneous feature spaces without relying on human
prior moral judgment. Finally, we propose two practical unfairness
mitigation strategies based on the bias attribution results, namely
unfairness removal (AIM REM) and fairness augmentation (AIM AUG).
By removing/augmenting a small fraction of unfair/fair samples,
our mitigation algorithms can alleviate both group and individual
unfairness with minimal utility loss.
3.1 Sample Bias Criterion
We first introduce the definition of sample bias and then discuss the
rationale for our design. Aligned with the philosophy that fairness
is the absence of any prejudice or favoritism towards an individual
or group based on their inherent or acquired characteristics [41], our
goal is to establish a sample bias definition that can effectively
characterize the prejudices encoded in data, be it directed towards
specific individuals or demographic groups. Specifically, assuming
given (i) an appropriate similarity function 𝜎X(·,·):X×X↦→[ 0,1]
defined on the input feature space, and (ii) the credibility 𝑐𝑖∈[0,1]
of each data instance (x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖), we define the criterion of sample
bias as follows.
Definition 3.1 (Sample Bias ).A data sample(x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖)is biased
if its similar samples specified by 𝜎X(·,·)from the other sensitive
groupD𝑠𝑗≠𝑠𝑖:={(x𝑗,𝑦𝑗,𝑠𝑗)|𝑠𝑗≠𝑠𝑖}receive different (i.e., 𝑦𝑗≠𝑦𝑖)
and credible (i.e., with high credibility 𝑐𝑖) treatments.
In an ideal world, the credibility of samples could be assessed
by domain experts reviewing each data instance. However, this
would incur substantial costs, making it generally impractical in
real-world applications. When human-evaluated credibility is not
available, we propose to use the following more practical definition
of credibility that can be straightforwardly computed:
Definition 3.2 (Sample Credibility ).A sample(x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖)with label
𝑦𝑖is credible if its similar samples specified by 𝜎X(·,·)from the
same sensitive group D𝑠𝑗=𝑠𝑖:={(x𝑗,𝑦𝑗,𝑠𝑗)|𝑠𝑗=𝑠𝑖}received same
treatments (i.e., 𝑦𝑗=𝑦𝑖).
Remark 3.3 (Intuition and Example ).The intuition behind Defini-
tions 3.1 and 3.2 is that if an individual 𝑎from group 𝐴received
treatment𝑦with high credibility (i.e., other same-group individuals
similar to𝑎also receive the same treatment 𝑦.), then an individual
𝑏from group 𝐵with similar attributes to 𝑎should also receive the
same treatment 𝑦. For a practical example, if a male applicant 𝑎is
approved for a loan, and this decision is credible (i.e., not caused
by random rare events or data errors), then a female applicant 𝑏
with similar conditions (income, education, etc.) to 𝑎should also
have her loan approved. If this is not the case, then we consider
𝑏was being discriminated and thus the data sample documenting
her application case exhibits historical bias.Connection to Existing Fairness Notions. Our sample bias cri-
terion is grounded in the overarching principles behind popular al-
gorithmic fairness notions, including group [ 17], individual [ 17,27],
and counterfactual fairness [ 35]. Specifically, as a widely used fair-
ness notion, group fairness (GF) promotes equitable outcomes for
different groups in terms of statistics such as positive rates. How-
ever, GF has been criticized for lacking guarantees on the treatment
of individual cases [ 17,27] since it is defined on the group average.
Alternatively, individual fairness (IF) is based on the consensus that
“similar individuals should be treated similarly", but the absence
of group constraints makes it challenging for IF to characterize
systematic discrimination and related implicit bias in data [ 8,20].
Our bias is defined on individuals but goes beyond just consid-
ering the consistency of similar samples. It simultaneously takes
into account demographic membership to ensure fairness across
different groups. Further, counterfactual fairness (CF) is based on
the intuition that “an individual should receive same decision in
both the actual world and a counterfactual world where the individ-
ual belonged to a different demographic group". Nevertheless, CF
generally relies on causal models that require substantial domain
knowledge and cost to obtain unobserved variables and construct
the associated causal graph. Even with such efforts, causal models
can only be built under strong assumptions [ 35]. Interestingly, re-
cent research suggests that CF is largely equivalent to demographic
parity [47], a basic group fairness constraint.
Our bias definition is partially inspired by CF but has been rea-
sonably simplified, and moreover, taking into account the credibility
of the samples, a point that is largely overlooked by the previous
works but is crucial for robust sample bias attribution. This makes
our definition not reliant on expert knowledge and strong assump-
tions for constructing causal models and (ways of estimating) latent
variables [ 35,47], while also preventing random events/noise in
the real world from disrupting bias estimation. To sum up, com-
pared with existing fairness notions, our sample bias definition can
characterize individual-level and group-level fairness in a practical,
intuitive, and robust manner, while also allowing self-explanatory
bias attribution.
3.2 Unfairness Attribution and Interpretation
Computing Self-Explanatory AIM Bias Score. We now for-
mally describe our AIM bias attribution algorithm. To further illus-
trate the practical implications of our sample bias (Definition 3.1)
and credibility (Definition 3.2) criterion, we present probabilistic
definitions for bias and credibility based on the underlying data
distribution, and show that our criterion can be seen as utilizing a
weighted local regression [ 13–15] to estimate sample bias/credibility
on the observed data. To start with, we give the probabilistic defini-
tion of sample bias 𝑏𝑖for a data instance (x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖):
𝑏𝑖:=Pr[𝑌=¬𝑦𝑖|𝑆=¬𝑠𝑖,𝑋=x𝑖], (1)
i.e., the true probability that a sample with identical attributes x𝑖
but from another sensitive group ¬𝑠𝑖has the opposite label ¬𝑦𝑖. A
larger𝑏𝑖signifies that the sample is more likely to have received
treatment inconsistent with similar samples from different groups,
thus carrying more historical bias.
 
2016KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Zhining Liu et al.
However, it is evident that 𝑏𝑖cannot be directly calculated as the
underlying distribution Pr[𝑌|𝑆,𝑋]is usually unknown. Alterna-
tively, we can utilize weighted local regression (WLR) [ 13] as a non-
parametric statistical method to estimate 𝑏𝑖based on the observed
data. The general idea of WLR is to do regression on samples that
are in the neighborhood of the point being estimated, thereby pro-
viding a more accurate and efficient estimation of the target based
on local data patterns. Here we employ a soft variant, where the sim-
ilarity𝜎X(·,·)specifies the more local samples by assigning higher
weights instead of doing hard nearest-neighbor selection [ 13] as in
the original WLR. For robust bias estimation, we incorporate sam-
ple credibility ˆ𝑐𝑗as the weighting function, which will be defined
later in this section. Intuitively, if a sample 𝑗has low credibility,
sayˆ𝑐𝑗=0, it will have no effect in estimating the bias. Specifically,
recall that for any event 𝐴, we have Pr[𝐴|𝑆,𝑋]=E[ 1[𝐴]|𝑆,𝑋].
We can estimate 𝑏𝑖by doing regression w.r.t. indicators:
ˆ𝑏𝑖:=arg min
𝑏∈R∑︁
𝑗∈D1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖]𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)ˆ𝑐𝑗(𝑏− 1[𝑦𝑗=¬𝑦𝑖])2,(2)
where 1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖]implies that we use different-group samples for
regression,𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)specifies the local samples, and ˆ𝑐𝑗serves as
the weighting function which gives high weights to more credible
data points. Eq. (2) has closed form solution
ˆ𝑏𝑖=Í
𝑗∈D 1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖] 1[𝑦𝑗=¬𝑦𝑖]ˆ𝑐𝑗𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)
Í
𝑗∈D 1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖]ˆ𝑐𝑗𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)∈[0,1],(3)
which can be seen as an realization of our Definition 3.1 for sam-
ple bias: we consider a sample is biased if its similar (with high
𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)) samples from the other sensitive group ( 1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖])
receive different ( 1[𝑦𝑗=¬𝑦𝑖]) and credible (with high ˆ𝑐𝑗) treat-
ments. Similarly, the sample credibility can be defined as the true
probability that sample (x𝑖,𝑠𝑖)should having label 𝑦𝑖:
𝑐𝑖:=Pr[𝑌=𝑦𝑖|𝑆=𝑠𝑖,𝑋=𝑥𝑖]. (4)
A larger𝑐𝑖indicates that the label of this sample is more consistent
with the underlying data distribution, and therefore has higher
credibility. We can estimate 𝑐𝑖in a similar way by solving
ˆ𝑐𝑖:=arg min
𝑐∈R∑︁
𝑗∈D1[𝑠𝑗=𝑠𝑖]𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)(𝑐− 1[𝑦𝑗=𝑦𝑖])2.(5)
The solution of Eq. (5) gives our credibility estimation:
ˆ𝑐𝑖=Í
𝑗∈D 1[𝑠𝑗=𝑠𝑖] 1[𝑦𝑗=𝑦𝑖]𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)
Í
𝑗∈D 1[𝑠𝑗=𝑠𝑖]𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)∈[0,1], (6)
which is also well-aligned with our sample credibility criterion
given in Definition 3.2: a sample is credible if its similar (with high
𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)) samples from the same group ( 1[𝑠𝑗=𝑠𝑖]) received
same (1[𝑦𝑗=𝑦𝑖]) treatment.
Interpreting the AIM Bias Score. As mentioned earlier, and as
readily observed from the bias criterion (Definition 3.1) and estima-
tion (Eq. (3)), our derived AIM sample bias score is self-explanatory:
the bias score ˆ𝑏of each sample can be naturally explained by the
corresponding samples that have contributed to ˆ𝑏. Specifically, as
implicated by Eq. (3), given the bias score ˆ𝑏𝑖of a sample(x𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖),
the bias contribution of sample (x𝑗,𝑦𝑗,𝑠𝑗)toˆ𝑏𝑖is
ˆ𝑏contr
𝑖𝑗=1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖] 1[𝑦𝑗=¬𝑦𝑖]ˆ𝑐𝑗𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)Í
𝑗∈D 1[𝑠𝑗=¬𝑠𝑖]ˆ𝑐𝑗𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)∈[0,1].(7)Intuitively, for sample 𝑖from group A, a sample 𝑗from group B
has large bias contribution 𝑏contr
𝑖𝑗if it is highly similar to𝑖(with
high𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖)) and highly credible (with large ˆ𝑐𝑗), yet received
different treatment ( 1[𝑦𝑗=¬𝑦𝑖]). Practitioners can discover and
audit discrimination present in the data by examining the bias score
and interpretation of each sample. We conduct experiments and
case studies on real-world data in Section 4.2 to validate the quality
and soundness of AIM bias attribution and interpretation results.
Practical Similarity Computation. We now discuss how to de-
termine the similarity metric 𝜎X(·,·):X×X↦→[ 0,1]in practice.
In principle, any similarity measure that satisfies the above definition
can be seamlessly integrated with our framework. However, finding
an appropriate similarity metric is not always easy, as real-world
data can exhibit complex structure in heterogeneous feature space
that contains both numerical (e.g., age, income) and categorical (e.g.,
residence, occupation) values. It often requires human experts to de-
sign task-specific similarity functions based on domain knowledge,
or to directly judge the similarity of sample pairs in the data, both
incurring significant costs in practice [ 20,36]. To address this, we
present an intuitive andpractical similarity measure that requires
minimum user input based on two key ideas: (i) creating a compara-
bility graph to capture the local similarity between input samples;
and (ii) applying a graph proximity measure on the comparability
graph to capture the global similarity that reflects the manifold
structure of the input data.
To start with, we first define the comparability between samples
by limiting the maximum allowed disparity in numerical/categorical
features. Let rx/dxrepresent the numerical/categorical part of fea-
ture vector x, and given user-defined numerical/categorical dispar-
ity thresholds 𝑡𝑟,𝑡𝑑>0, we define sample comparability and the
comparability constraint Ψ𝑡𝑟,𝑡𝑑:X×X↦→{ 0,1}as follows:
Definition 3.4 (Sample Comparability ).Two samples x1andx2
have comparability under thresholds 𝑡𝑟and𝑡𝑑if both holds: (i) the
disparity in any numerical feature is smaller than or equal to 𝑡𝑟, and
(ii) at most𝑡𝑑categorical features are different. Formally, the above
conditions can be write as a comparability constraint function:
Ψ𝑡𝑟,𝑡𝑑(x1,x2)= 

x1−r(𝑖)
x2|≤𝑡𝑟]=1
andΣ𝑛𝑑
𝑖=11[d(𝑖)
x1≠d(𝑖)
x2]≤𝑡𝑑;
0otherwise.(8)
Practitioners can set Ψ𝑡𝑟,𝑡𝑑based on the application scenario and
feature importance to ensure semantic similarity among compa-
rable samples. This realization prevents costly human evaluation
for a large number of sample pairs, and avoids the complexity of
finding appropriate distance functions in heterogeneous feature
spaces. The sample comparability defines a comparability graph
A[𝑖,𝑗]=Ψ𝑡𝑟,𝑡𝑑(x𝑖,x𝑗),∀1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛over the input data based on
local similarity. To capture the global similarity that reflects the
manifold structure of the input data, we further utilize a graph prox-
imity measure. In this study, we employ random walk with restart
(RWR) [ 44,55] due to (i) its effectiveness in capturing the global
graph structure and (ii) its flexibility in adjusting the locality of the
similarity. We first remove the self-loops in A, then with symmetric
normalization ˜W←D−1
2AD−1
2and damping factor 𝑝∈[0,1], the
RWR similarity matrix can be derived by Q=(1−𝑝)(I−𝑝˜W)−1[44],

We refer the readers to [ 44,55] and references therein for more
details on the properties of RWR. With this practical similarity
measure, we can use Q[𝑖,𝑗]as𝜎X(x𝑗,x𝑖). We now summarize the
process of AIM unfairness attribution in Algorithm 1.
3.3AIM for Unfairness Mitigation
Our bias attribution framework can also facilitate unfairness mitiga-
tion. We introduce two strategies for mitigating unfairness through
informed minimal data editing: unfairness removal (AIM REM) and
fairness augmentation (AIM AUG). By removing a small fraction of
samples exhibiting high bias or augmenting samples with low bias,
these methods can effectively mitigate both group and individual
unfairness while incurring minimal to zero loss in predictive utility.
AIM REM: Unfairness Removal. The first intuitive approach to
mitigating data unfairness is simply to delete samples from the
dataset that exhibit high bias (i.e., carry historical discriminatory
information). This can be achieved by simply sorting the training
samples ˆ𝑏𝑖and removing the top-K samples with the highest bias
scores from the training set. Additionally, considering the inevitable
information loss from discarding samples, to achieve fairness with
minimal sample removal while also alleviating the impact of class
imbalance, we adaptively select a subgroup for removal based on the
class distribution. Specifically, we remove majority class samples
to alleviate class imbalance. If the positive class (i.e., favorable
treatment) is the majority, we select samples for removal from the
privileged group (e.g., gender/race with favoritism), and vice versa.
Users can control the number of removed samples through a sample
removal budget 𝑘. This approach is straightforward to implement
and requires little additional computational cost.
AIM AUG: Fairness Augmentation. Despite the simplicity and
effectiveness of AIM REM, it may still lead to some potential infor-
mation loss. Thus we further propose an augmentation-based ap-
proach to promote fairness. Specifically, instead of discarding unfair
samples, we suggest synthesizing more fair data instances through
neighborhood mixup. This approach can augment the pattern of fair
samples, compelling the model to focus more on learning the fair
patterns, and thus mitigating unfairness without deleting informa-
tion from the original data. Similarly to the above, we augment theminority class in order to alleviate class imbalance. If the positive
class (i.e., favorable treatment) is the minority, we select fair sam-
ples from the protected group (i.e., gender/race being discriminated)
for augmentation, and vice versa.
Existing research indicates that simple perturbation (such as
adding Gaussian noise or arbitrarily changing categorical features)
may generate unrealistic samples that escape the data manifold [ 36],
e.g., here we quote a good example from [ 36]: “sample with age
5 or 10 but holding a doctoral degree or getting $80K annual in-
come”. To ensure the semantic coherence of synthetic samples, we
propose neighborhood-based mixup for sample synthesis. Specifi-
cally, we first use 1−ˆ𝑏𝑖as a weight (where low-bias samples have
high weights) to randomly select a fair seed sample (x𝑠,𝑦𝑠,𝑠𝑠)
for augmentation. Then, based on the similarity Q, we choose
the most similar 𝑛same-group samples and randomly select one,
say(x𝑡,𝑦𝑡,𝑠𝑡), as the mixup target. Subsequently, we sample the
mixup weight 𝜆∼Uniform(0,1). Denoting the synthetic sample as
(x∗,𝑦∗,𝑠∗), it has the same group membership and label as the seed,
i.e.,𝑦∗=𝑦𝑠,𝑠∗=𝑠𝑠. For numerical features, we simply perform
linear mixup r𝑥∗=𝜆r𝑥𝑠+(1−𝜆)r𝑥𝑡. While for each categorical
feature d(𝑖), we sample value from seed/target w.r.t. a Bernoulli
distribution, i.e., d(𝑖)
𝑥∗=d(𝑖)
𝑥𝑠with probability 𝜆, and d(𝑖)
𝑥∗=d(𝑖)
𝑥𝑡with
probability 1−𝜆. It is worth noting that seed and target are similar
to each other, meaning that the disparity between each numerical
attributes are small and only a few categorical features are different.
Such neighborhood-based mixup ensures the semantic coherence
of the synthetic fair samples. We validate on real-world data in
Section 4.1 that both AIM REMandAIM AUGcan mitigate group and
individual unfairness with minimal or zero predictive utility loss.
4 Experiments and Analysis
In this section, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets to
answer the following research questions.
•RQ1 (mitigation): To what extent can AIM alleviate various
forms of discrimination against groups/individuals?
•RQ2 (attribution): Can AIM capture sample biases encod-
ing unfair/discriminatory aspects in the data?
•RQ3 (interpretation): How can AIM provide intuitive and
reasonable explanations for attributed sample biases?
We first introduce the datasets, experiment protocol, and baselines,
and then present the empirical results and corresponding analysis.
Datasets. We conduct experiments on census dataset Adult [34],
criminological dataset Compas [4], educational dataset LSA [50]
(Law School Admission), and medical dataset MEPS [16] (Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey) to validate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed AIM framework in various application domains. For each
dataset, we choose one or two attributes related to ethics as sensitive
attributes that exhibit significant group and individual unfairness
in standard training. More details can be found in Appendix A.1.
Experiment Protocol. To obtain reliable results, a 5-fold cross-
validation is employed and we report the average test score to elimi-
nate randomness. In each run, 3/1/1 folds of the data are used as the
training/validation/test set (i.e., 60%/20%/20% split). We transform
the categorical features into one-hot encoded features, and stan-
dardize the numerical features into the range of [0,1]. We compare

Figure 2: Compare AIM REMandAIM AUGwith group fairness baselines. We show the trade-off between utility (x-axis) and
unfairness metrics (y-axis) on 4 real-world FairML tasks. Results close to the upper-left corner have better trade-offs, i.e., with
low unfairness (x-axis) and high utility (y-axis). Each column corresponds to a FairML task, and each row corresponds to a
utility-unfairness metric pair. As AIM’s utility-unfairness trade-off can be controlled by the sample removal/augmentation
budget, we show its performance with line plots. We show error bars for both utility and unfairness metrics.
AIM with various FairML methods proposed for group/individual
fairness, considering their ability to mitigate unfairness while main-
taining predictive utility. For utility, we consider the area under the
Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) and Average Preci-
sion (AP) for unbiased utility evaluation due to class imbalance in
occupation proportions in the data. Four popular measures of group
and/or individual (un)fairness are used. For group fairness, we adopt
the widely used Demographic Parity (DP) [ 17] and Equalized Odds
(EO) [ 26]. For individual fairness, we use Prediction Consistency
(PC) following Yurochkin et al . [60] , Yurochkin and Sun [61]. It mea-
sures the sensitivity of model to individual’s group membership by
testing whether Pr[ˆ𝑌|𝑋=𝑥,𝑆=𝑠]=Pr[ˆ𝑌|𝑋=𝑥,𝑆=¬𝑠]for each
test instance. This is also known as test fairness [ 41] or predictive
parity [ 12]. We also adopt Generalized Entropy ( GE) [ 53], a com-
prehensive metric that measures group and individual unfairness
simultaneously with inequality indices.
Baselines. We have the following 10 FairML baselines: (i) Reduc-
tion [2] reduces fair classification to a sequence of cost-sensitive
classification problems, returning the classifier with the lowest
empirical error subject to fair constraints. (ii) Threshold [26]
applies group-specific thresholds that optimize predictive perfor-
mance while subjecting to the group fairness constraints. (iii) Fair-
Reweight [30] weights the examples in each (group, label) com-
bination differently to ensure fairness before classification. (iv)
AdaFair [29] is an ensemble learning algorithm based on AdaBoost,
it takes the fairness into account in each boosting round. (v) Learn-
FairRep [62] finds a latent representation which encodes the data
well but obfuscates information about protected attributes. (vi) Sen-
sitive Subspace Robustness (SenSR) [ 60] is an individual fairness
algorithm based on Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
It finds a sensitive subspace which encodes the sensitive informa-
tion most, and generates perturbations on this sensitive subspaceduring optimization. (vii) Sensitive Set Invariance (SenSeI) [ 61] is
also based on DRO. It involves distances penalties on both input
and model predictions to construct perturbations for training in-
dividually fair model. (viii) FairMixup [42] transforms fairness
objectives into differentiable terms and optimizes them using gra-
dient descent. (ix) Adversarial Debiasing (AdvFair) [ 1,64] learns a
classifier maximizing prediction ability while simultaneously mini-
mizing an adversary’s ability to predict sensitive attributes from
predictions. (x) Finally, HSIC [5] minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion between prediction accuracy and sensitive
attributes. We consider logistic regression and neural network as
base models in our experiments. We use scikit-learn [ 46] to imple-
ment logistic regression. DRO/gradient-based FairML methods (e.g.,
[1,5,42,60,61]) that do not compatible with this pipeline will be
validated with neural networks implemented with PyTorch [ 45].
More implementation details can be found in Appendix A.2.
4.1AIM for Unfairness Mitigation
AIM for group fairness (RQ1). We first compare AIM with five
FairML baselines that mitigate group fairness: Reduction, Thresh-
old, FairReweight, AdaFair, and Learn Fair Representation. For a
comprehensive evaluation, we show the utility-fairness trade-off be-
tween ROC and group unfairness (DP, EO) on 4 real-world FairML
tasks from different domains with race being the sensitive attribute.
Note that Reduction and Threshold require specifying the group
unfairness constraint for optimization, thus we report their perfor-
mance with DP and EO as target, respectively. We use line plots
to present the performance of AIM REM/AIM AUGwith different sam-
ple removal/augmentation budget which controls the trade-off of
AIM between utility and fairness. The results are detailed in Fig-
ure 2. More empirical results with additional utility metrics on more
FairML tasks can be found in Appendix B.

We summarize the key observations as follows: (i)AIM can mit-
igate unfairness with minimal/zero utility cost. Across all settings,
AIM achieves the optimal trade-off compared to other group fair-
ness baselines: it either outperforms or matches the best baseline
in terms of utility-fairness trade-off (close to the upper-left corner
in Figure 2). (ii)Since AIM REMandAIM AUGare designed to promote
fairness while balancing class distribution, on datasets with signifi-
cant class imbalance (e.g., Adult ,LSA, MEPS with 24.8/27.9/17.2%
positive samples), they can mitigate unfairness without sacrificing
predictive performance, and in some cases, may even enhance it (e.g.,
ROC on the MEPS dataset). (iii)At the same fairness level, AIM AUG
generally exhibits better classification performance compared to
AIM REMas it retains the original training set and promote fairness
by adding augmented data. We have similar observations in the fol-
lowing experiments on individual fairness. However, we note that
AIM AUGrequires a higher sample manipulation budget and compu-
tational cost than AIM REM.(iv)We notice that some baselines may
worsen specific fairness metrics. For example, LearnFairRep can
help reduce DP but increase EO in the Adult andLSA tasks. This is
due to the potential incompatibility between fairness notions, and
we refer readers to [33, 51] for more related discussions.
AIM for individual fairness (RQ1). We further verify the ef-
fectiveness of AIM in promoting individual fairness (IF). 6 FairML
baselines that mitigate individual unfairness are included: Learn-
FairRep (LFR), SenSR, SenSEI, AdvFair, FairMixup, HSIC. Since
these methods generally rely on gradient-based optimization, we
use neural networks as the base ML model in this section. Follow-
ing the existing literature [ 60,61], We test them on the widely
used Adult dataset, with gender and race being the sensitive at-
tribute, respectively. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we
adopt three utility metrics (ACC, ROC, AP) and three metrics for
individual and/or group (un)fairness: PC for individual, EO forgroup, and GE for both. For AIM REMandAIM AUG, we select the sam-
ple removal/augmentation budget that maximizes PC (individual
fairness) on the validation set. The results are detailed in Table 1.
We summarize our findings as follows: (i)AIM REMandAIM AUG
simultaneously promote both individual and group fairness. Com-
pared to the IF-targeted FairML algorithms, AIM demonstrates
competitive performance in mitigating individual unfairness, while
concurrently achieving better group fairness. (ii)AIM exhibits sig-
nificantly less (if any) utility losses. Baseline methods often lead to
significant performance declines, whereas AIM achieves minimal
utility loss and, in some cases, even enhances certain performance
metrics due to its ability to alleviate class imbalance. Taking Adult -
gender as an example, compared to baseline methods with a relative
ACC loss of 1.6-4.3%, AIM incurs only 0.1-0.8% loss. This advantage
becomes even more pronounced in ROC/AP, e.g., FairML base-
lines result in an AP loss of 7.4-19.7%, while AIM brings about a
gain of 0.3-1.4%. This align with our earlier experiments on group
fairness. (iii) FairML methods devised for individual fairness can
potentially lead to group unfairness. For instance, on Adult -gender,
while LFR/SenSR/SenSEI can promote individual PC, they also de-
grade group EO with an increase of 16.9/41.3/33.9%, respectively. GE
that reflects “how unequally the outcomes of an algorithm benefit
different individuals or groups in a population” [ 53] better captures
this aspect: baseline methods that improve PC actually degrade GE .
We refer the readers to [ 8,20] for more discussions on the trade-offs
and conflicts between individual and group fairness.
Finally, we notice that the majority of existing FairML methods
are designed for a specific learning task and/or fairness metric(s),
thus optimizing one metric might be at the (unintentional) expense
of another metric. In contrast, as demonstrated by the experiments
above, AIM avoids such intrinsic tension by focusing on the root
of unfairness (i.e., historically biased samples) and thus can lead to
a near-universal improvement across different metrics.

4.2AIM for Bias Attribution and Interpretation
In this section, we conduct experiments and case studies to show
the soundness of AIM in unfairness attribution and interpretation.
AIM identifies discriminatory samples (RQ2). We now vali-
date the soundness of AIM unfair attribution by verifying whether
the high-bias samples identified by AIM encode discriminatory
information from the data, and contribute to the unfairness in
model predictions. Specifically, we remove varying quantities of
samples with high to low bias scores by AIM REMfrom the training
dataset of Compas and observe the (un)fairness metrics of the model
trained on the modified data. We compare these results with a naïve
method that randomly remove samples from training data. Results
are shown in Figure 3. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we
include DP and EO for group unfairness, Predictive Inconsistency
(PI, i.e., 1 - PC) for individual unfairness, and GE for both. It can be
observed that randomly removing samples does not alleviate the
model’s unfairness. At the same time, removing an equal number
of high-bias samples identified by AIM significantly reduces the
encoded discriminatory information in the data, and effectively
promotes both group and individual fairness in model predictions.
This verifies the rationality of AIM unfair attribution.
Figure 3: Evaluation of the AIM bias attribution quality. Re-
moving high-bias samples identified by AIM from the data
greatly reduces the discrimination in the model prediction.
Visual evaluation of AIM bias attribution (RQ2). To intu-
itively demonstrate the bias attribution ability of AIM, we fur-
ther design a series of synthetic datasets with different types of
bias for visual evaluation of AIM’s ability in capturing group- and
individual-level unfairness. In each dataset, we sample two groups
from the same distribution, with group #1 as the reference group,
and introduce group/individual-level discrimination to group #2.
For group unfairness, we altered the class boundary for the target
group to simulate group-based discrimination (different groups
having different "thresholds" for positive outcomes). For individual
unfairness, we randomly selected 10% of samples from the target
group and flipped their labels to simulate discrimination against
specific individuals (similar individuals not being treated similarly).
This approach provides ground truth labels for each sample’s bias
status, enabling us to visualize the quality of AIM bias attribution.
Figure 4 presents our experimental results. Each row in the
figure represents a synthetic dataset, and we label the bias type
of the data at the beginning of each row. For each dataset, the 1st
and 2nd columns display the data and class distribution of groups
#1 and #2, respectively. The 3rd column shows the ground truth
bias distribution on the target group (#2), where blue indicates
unbiased and red indicates biased. In a similar manner, the 4th
column displays the sample bias distribution detected by AIM, with
red indicating biased samples (with AIM bias score > 0.5). We alsoannotate the accuracy of AIM-detected biased samples w.r.t. the
ground truth in the 4th-column subplots. It can be observed that
AIM accurately detects group/individual-level bias in the data, with
very high bias detection accuracy ranging from 97.0% to 99.8%.
Figure 4: Synthetic bias detection results. AIM (4th col-
umn) can accurately detect ground-truth biased samples (3rd
columns) under both group- and individual-level unfairness.
AIM reflects the level of discrimination of a dataset (RQ2).
From a macro perspective, we further show that the outcomes of
bias attribution can also offer insights into how “discriminatory” a
dataset is. We inherit the four metrics used in Figure 3, but examine
the correlation between the average AIM sample bias scores on
the training set and the predictive unfairness of the model on the
test set, as shown in Figure 5. It can be observed that the average
AIM sample bias score is a good indicator of the level of dataset
discrimination, especially in terms of the comprehensive metric GE
that captures both group and individual unfairness. This further
validates the soundness of AIM bias attribution.
Figure 5: AIM bias score reflect dataset unfairness level. Each
dot denotes a combination of datasets, sensitive attributes,
and train/test split. We report average training sample bias
(x-axis) and test unfairness of the model predictions (y-axis).

AIM provides reasonable sample bias explanation (RQ3). Fi-
nally, we provide case studies on real-world data to intuitively
demonstrate the validity of AIM’s bias attribution and explanation.
In Table 2, we present two high-bias samples detected by AIM from
different genders in the Adult-Gender task, along with their corre-
sponding top-5 explanations (i.e., the top 5 samples contributing
most to their bias). It can be observed that for high-bias samples,
AIM can retrieve samples from another group that are similar but
have different and credible labels, and quantify their contributions
to the bias ( ˆ𝑏contr) as explanations.
For example, the bias score of the first query (a female with a
negative label) is largely contributed by the first male sample in
line 2, who has highly similar attributes but also a different and
highly credible label (with ˆ𝑐=0.9027). Similarly, for the second
query sample (a male with a positive label), it is considered biased
because similar females have negative labels. This also underscores
another practical implication of the AIM bias score: for a sample
receiving positive/negative treatment, a high bias score suggests
that it may have received an unfair advantage/disadvantage due to
its group membership compared to individuals with similar attributes.
Such sample-level explanation can assist human experts inspect
and understand discrimination present in the data, and provide
insights into how to design fairer decision criteria in the future.

Fair Machine Learning. FairML advocates for ethical regula-
tions to rectify algorithms, ensuring non-discrimination against
any group or individual [ 6,10,41]. The concept of group fairness
(GF) seeks equalized outcomes across sensitive groups concerning
statistics like positive rate [ 26]. Although intuitive, GF falls short
in ensuring fairness on an individual level [ 17,27]. Individual fair-
ness (IF) is thus proposed, with its main idea being that similar
samples should receive similar treatment [ 17]. However, due to the
absence of group constraints, IF cannot capture systematic bias
against groups [ 20]. Counterfactual fairness (CF) examines the con-
sistency of algorithms on a single instance and its counterfactuals
when sensitive attributes are altered [ 35]. However, this notion
and its evaluations heavily depend on the causal structure rooted
in the data generation process, thus explicit modeling is usually
impractical [ 36]. AIM is grounded on the existing fairness notions
and can practically capture various prejudices encoded in the data.Discrimination Discovery. There are a few works on discrim-
ination discovery, but their scope significantly differs from ours.
The discrimination discovery in [ 48] is aimed at systems based
on classification (association) rules. They propose an extended lift
measure to assess whether a classification rule might lead to un-
lawful discrimination against groups protected by law, and further
propose a system for discrimination discovery in database [ 49].
Apparently, this type of discrimination discovery cannot be gener-
alized to non-rule-based ML models. Another line of work [ 65,66]
models the direct/indirect discrimination as the path-specific effects
on the causal network. Like counterfactual fairness [ 35], this also re-
quires explicit modeling of the causal structure and data generation
process. Additionally, their discrimination discovery is achieved
by computing a score for the entire dataset, where a high score
indicates that the dataset as a whole exhibits discrimination. This
is fundamentally different from our sample-level bias attribution.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we investigate the problem of identifying samples car-
rying historical biases in training data. Building on existing fairness
notions, we establish a criterion and propose practical algorithms
for measuring and countering sample bias. We propose a practical
framework AIM, which supports (i) sample-level bias attribution,
(ii) intuitive explanation of the bias of each instance, and (iii) effec-
tive unfairness mitigation with minimal or zero predictive utility
loss. Extensive experiments and analysis on various real-world
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in attributing,
interpreting, and mitigating unfairness.

A Reproducibility
A.1 Dataset Statistics and Details
Adult dataset The Adult dataset [ 34] contains census personal
records with attributes like age, education, race, etc. The task is
to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year. Compas
dataset The Compas dataset [ 4] is a criminological dataset record-
ing prisoners’ information like criminal history, jail and prison
time, demographic, sex, etc. The task is to predict a recidivism risk
score for defendants. LSA dataset LSA (Law School Admission)
dataset [ 50] contains admissions data from 25 law schools, features
include applicant attributes like LSAT score, undergraduate GPA,
residency, race, etc. The target label is the admission decision of
each applicant. MEPS dataset The MEPS (Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey) dataset [ 16] comprises demographic features, health
status, income, and other attributes of surveyed individuals. The
goal is to predict whether the individual has high medical service
utilization. We use the AIF360 [ 7] toolbox1to retrieve and process
all used datasets. Detailed data statistics are listed in Table 3.
A.2 Implementation Details
Baselines We implement the 10 FairML baselines using standard
Python toolkits or official code base provided by the paper authors.
Specifically, we use the AIF360 [ 7] package1to implement Reduc-
tion, FairReweight, LearnFairRep, AdvFair; the fairlearn [ 9]
package2for implementing Threshold; the inFairness [ 3] package3
for implementing SenSR andSenSeI; and the FBB benchmark4for
implementing FairMixup, AdvFair, and HSIC. For AdaFair, we

2https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn
3https://github.com/IBM/inFairness
4https://github.com/ahxt/fair_fairness_benchmarkuse the official code base5for implementation. Their hyperparame-
ters are fine-tuned to get the best fairness-utility trade-off.
Models We consider logistic regression and neural network as
base models in our experiments. We use scikit-learn [ 46] to im-
plement logistic regression. DRO-based FairML methods (SenSR,
SenSEI) that do not compatible with this pipeline are validated
with neural networks implemented with PyTorch [ 45]. For logistic
regression, we use the default parameters specified by sklearn. For
neural network, we use the implementation provided in the official
example in inFairness [ 3] for SenSR/SenSEI to guarantee fair com-
parison. The neural network is a three-layer MLP with 100 hidden
units and ReLU activation function. We use Adam optimizer with
learning rate 1e-3 and cross-entropy loss, and train the MLP for 100
epochs with a mini-batch size 32 until it is converged.
Hyperparameters AIM bias attribution criterion itself does not
have any hyperparameters. Similarity computing involves three
main parameters: numerical and categorical disparity thresholds
𝑡𝑟and𝑡𝑑for determining sample comparability, and the damping
factor𝑝of RWR used for computing similarity. We choose 𝑡𝑟=0.1
and𝑡𝑑=2to offer sufficient comparable samples while maintaining
sample semantic comparability. The damping factor 𝑝is set to 0.1
(i.e., restart probability for RWR = 0.9) to guarantee locality while
capturing global similarity. In general, these three parameters can
all be regarded as parameters that directly or indirectly determine
the locality of similarity, the smaller they are, the more local the
similarity is. Specifically, smaller 𝑡𝑟/𝑡𝑑results in more strict com-
parability constraints (also fewer comparable sample pairs) and
thus more locality, and smaller 𝑝means higher restart probability
in RWR, thus also more locality in similarity. Overall, these three
parameters do not affect the validity of similarity and AIM bias attri-
bution. Users can adjust these values (or use other expert-specified
similarity metrics if available) based on the application scenario.
B More Results and Discussions
Additional Results In Figure 2, we report the results with only
ROC on 4 FairML tasks due to space limitation. Here we provide
additional results showing the utility-fairness trade-off between 2
utility metrics (ROC, AP) and 2 unfairness metrics (DP, EO) on 7
real-world FairML tasks from different domains. Other protocols
are identical to Figure 2. We report the additional results in Figure 6.
It can be observed that the additional results are consistent with
the conclusions derived in the paper from Figure 2. Across all 28 (2
utility metrics x 2 unfairness metrics x 7 FairML tasks) settings, AIM
achieves the optimal trade-off compared to other group fairness
baselines: it either outperforms or matches the best baseline in
terms of utility-fairness trade-off (close to the upper-left corner).
This further validates the effectiveness and generality of AIM in
mitigating unfairness.
Complexity Analysis The complexity of estimating bias/credibility
through Eq. (3)/Eq. (6) is 𝑂(𝑁2). However, we note that both bias
and credibility computations can be performed in matrix form, and
thus can be efficiently accelerated with the parallel computing capa-
bilities of modern GPUs. The time complexity of bias computation

Figure 6: Compare AIM REMandAIM AUGwith group fairness baselines. We show the utility-fairness trade-off between 2 utility
metrics (x-axis) and 2 unfairness metrics (y-axis) on 7 real-world FairML tasks. Results close to the upper-left corner have
better trade-offs, i.e., with low unfairness (x-axis) and high utility (y-axis). Each column corresponds to a FairML task, and
each row corresponds to a utility-unfairness metric pair. As AIM’s utility-unfairness trade-off can be controlled by the sample
removal/augmentation budget, we show its performance with line plots. We show error bars for both utility and unfairness.
can be reduced to 𝑂(𝑁2
𝐶), where𝐶is the number of available com-
puting units. The complexity of computing similarity mainly arises
from the matrix inversion step in RWR. There are many techniques
can be employed to accelerate the solution of RWR, such as Fast
Random Walk with Restart [ 55] that use low-rank approximation
and Sherman–Morrison Lemma [ 52] to approximate(1−𝑝˜W)−1.
In practice, if the dataset is large enough, and there are sufficient
comparable samples to support the bias attribution and explana-
tion for each sample, one can also consider directly using sample
comparability as similarity to avoid additional computational costs.
Limitation and Future Works At the end of the paper, we dis-
cuss the limitations of AIM and possible future directions to address
them. One potential limitation is the static data assumption of AIM:
as society evolves and relevant laws improve, the distribution of ob-
served data also changes [ 24,28]. It may not be reasonable to assess
and interpret bias in a new sample using data collected a decade ago.
A possible solution is to introduce a reasonable time-discounting fac-
tor into the definitions of bias and credibility to account for concept
drift [ 23]. Additionally, in streaming data scenarios, the current def-
inition requires recalculating similarity and sample bias/credibility
when new data arrives. Possible directions include maintaining acore matrix based on matrix low-rankness [ 56] to estimate data
similarity after incorporating new data, thereby avoiding the need
for re-computing RWR similarity each time. Exploring how to ex-
tend AIM to online scenarios to detect bias in newly arrived data in
real-time, and its impact on existing data, would be a valuable fu-
ture direction. We also note that our class-imbalance-aware design
significantly contributes to AIM’s advantage in predictive utility.
And the class imbalance problem (classifier’s uneven attention to
different classes) [ 37–39] is closely related to unfairness, partic-
ularly group fairness. Exploring the relationship between these
issues and developing joint solutions will be a promising direction
for future research. Finally, we note that the comparable graph in
this work can be seen as a simple nearest-neighbor-based graph.
In many practical applications, there are complex networks of re-
lationships between data points, forming graphs with intricate
topologies [ 40,59,63]. FairML on graph data has recently gained
significant attention, and extending AIM form artificial nearest-
neighbor-based graph to natural complex graph data would also be
an interesting direction.
