ABSTRACT
In causal inference, estimating heterogeneous treatment effects
(HTE) is critical for identifying how different subgroups respond
to interventions, with broad applications in fields such as precision
medicine and personalized advertising. Although HTE estimation
methods aim to improve accuracy, how to provide explicit sub-
group descriptions remains unclear, hindering data interpretation
and strategic intervention management. In this paper, we propose
CURLS , a novel rule learning method leveraging HTE, which can
effectively describe subgroups with significant treatment effects.
Specifically, we frame causal rule learning as a discrete optimiza-
tion problem, finely balancing treatment effect with variance and
considering the rule interpretability. We design an iterative pro-
cedure based on the minorize-maximization algorithm and solve
a submodular lower bound as an approximation for the original.
Quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies verify that
compared with state-of-the-art methods, CURLS can find subgroups
where the estimated and true effects are 16.1% and 13.8% higher and
the variance is 12.0% smaller, while maintaining similar or better
estimation accuracy and rule interpretability. Code is available at

1 INTRODUCTION
Causal inference is a data analysis process aiming at conclusions
about whether and to what extent treatments affect outcomes [ 46].
Data heterogeneity needs to be taken into account when estimat-
ing treatment effects, as the effect of the same treatment often
varies across subgroups. Discovering those subgroups with large
effects and low variance (hereinafter referred to as significant treat-
ment effect) compared to the overall population is widely used in
domains such as healthcare [ 48], marketing [ 54], and public admin-
istration [ 20]. For example, marketers would like to find customer
groups where advertising is more effective in driving purchases.
Since randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for
causal inference, are not always feasible due to cost or ethical con-
cerns, there is a strong need to uncover subgroups with significant
treatment effects from observational data.
Existing causal models that consider the data heterogeneity, such
as propensity score-based methods [ 18], double machine learn-
ing [ 12], meta-learners [ 33], entropy balancing [ 25] and tree-based
recursive partitioning [ 1,15], can estimate the effect of the treat-
ment on the outcome on subgroups or individuals. However, most
of these methods try to reduce the confounding bias in the estima-
tion rather than directly learning subgroups with significant effects.
Researchers have also explored rule learning [ 14,61] and subgroup
discovery [ 21,53], utilizing easy-to-understand rules to describe
subgroups with intriguing patterns. Unfortunately, most rule learn-
ing methods are oriented towards correlations rather than causality,
which may lead to imprecise estimations in selection bias-affected

interventions. Thus, enhancing the treatment effect interpretability
in the context of data heterogeneity is still underexplored.
We combine the strong analytical power of heterogeneous treat-
ment effect (HTE) estimation methods with the high interpretability
of rule learning to facilitate the identification and interpretation of
subgroups with significant treatment effects. However, two chal-
lenges must be addressed. First, the trade-off between multiple
objectives and constraints is not trivial. Since treatment effect esti-
mation is a statistical inference problem, in addition to requiring a
large effect value, it is also necessary to ensure that the uncertainty
of the estimates is small (as shown in Rule 1 in Fig. 1). Also, the
length and overlap of the rules are important constraints in order to
facilitate user interpretation. Second, recognizing useful subgroups
from a large number of potential candidates is difficult. Subgroups
can be obtained by combining different attributes and values, which
is often exponential and requires an efficient solution.
Figure 1: An illustrative toy example. There is only one co-
variate𝑋, and the change in 𝑌can be informally thought
of as the effect. The subgroup corresponding to Rule1 has a
high effect and low variance, which the users expect to find.
We propose CURLS , acausalrulelearning method for identify-
ingsubgroups with significant treatment effects. To address the
first challenge, we formally define causal rules, which consist of
subgroups described by conjunctive normal forms (CNFs) and the
corresponding effects estimated by inverse probability weighting
(IPW) [ 28]. Then, mining subgroups with large treatment effects
and low variance can be modeled as a discrete optimization problem.
For the second challenge, we prove the existence of an approximate
submodular lower bound for the optimization objective and design
a solution based on the minorize-maximization (MM) algorithm
and submodular optimization. Comprehensive quantitative experi-
ments and qualitative case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of
CURLS . In summary, our contributions are as follows:
•We pioneer the incorporation of rule learning into causal in-
ference, aiming to delineate subgroups with significant treat-
ment effects through rule-based descriptions. Specifically,
we formulate this as an optimization problem, considering
the trade-off between effects and variance and rule set size
and overlap constraints.
•We propose an efficient optimization algorithm that itera-
tively maximizes the submodular lower bound of the originalproblem, which cuts down the original exponential search
space.
•We conduct both quantitative and qualitative experiments,
demonstrating that CURLS delivers not only extra rule-based
interpretative capabilities for subgroups, but also enhances
the precision of effect estimation with a smaller variance.
Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in esti-
mated and true effect strength (CATE) by 16.1% and 13.8%,
respectively, and reduces variance by 12.0%.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we first review the algorithms related to HTE, then
discuss the progress of rule learning, and finally summarize the
work of subgroup discovery.
2.1 Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation
Causal inference identifies the effect of treatment on outcome. How-
ever, treatment effects are often not “one-size-fits-all”—they may
vary across the population. Current HTE research is divided into
conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and individual average
treatment effect (ITE) by population level. Reviews [ 24,62] provide
detailed analyses on treatment effect estimation.
CATE examines treatment effects on specific subgroups of the
population, conditional on similar covariates, such as certain demo-
graphic characteristics. Tree-based methods [ 1,2,55] are widely
used by dividing the covariate space into subspaces to maximize the
treatment effects heterogeneity. For example, Causal Tree [ 1] uses
part of the data to construct the tree and another part to estimate
the treatment effect in each subspace, avoiding overfitting by cross-
validation. To make the estimation more robust and smooth, Wager
et al. [55] proposed Causal Forest, which aggregates the results of
causal tree ensembles. The advantage of the tree model is its inter-
pretability, which naturally provides subgroups of heterogeneous
CATEs defined by root-to-leaf node paths.
ITE measures the difference in outcomes for individuals with or
without receiving the treatment. Since only one outcome can be ob-
served in the actual scenario, another potential outcome needs to be
estimated. Depending on whether the treatment and control groups
are estimated separately, existing methods can be categorized as
single-model-based and multi-model-based. The former fits treat-
ment effects with regression models. For example, Hill et al. [27] use
Bayesian additive regression trees to fit the outcome surface. The
latter fits the treated and control groups separately and can achieve
better performance when the difference between the outcomes of
the two groups is significant. The base model can use off-the-shelf
estimators, such as linear regression [ 11] or neural networks [ 30].
Although these models can be accurate in estimating effects with
carefully tuned parameters, they are generally uninterpretable.
Previous work has focused on how to estimate effects more ac-
curately, i.e., to exclude confounding bias in the observational data.
Instead, we aim to mine subgroups that have stronger effects with
small variances. To this end, we utilize a propensity-score-based
effect estimation method in our implementation and incorporate
the ability of rules to characterize subgroups.

2.2 Rule Learning
Rules are simple logical structures of the form "IF P THEN Q". Since
general rules are similar to the way humans think, rule learning
is employed in prediction or classification scenarios that require
high interpretability. The existing work can be broadly classified
into pre-mining and uniform optimization approaches.
Most studies [ 17,34,44,57,63] adopted the two-stage paradigm
consisting of rule generation (or rule pre-mining) and rule selec-
tion. First, rules are pre-mined through efficient algorithms such
as decision trees and association rule mining to reduce the search
space of rules significantly. In the second stage, appropriate rules
are selected from the candidate rules to form an unordered rule
set or an ordered rule list based on specific metrics (e.g., classifi-
cation accuracy). However, this separation paradigm can lead to
sub-optimal results as important rules may be missed in the rule
pre-mining stage, resulting in a loss of accuracy.
Recently, researchers have linked rule generation and selection
in a single optimization framework for rule learning. For example,
Dash et al. [14] formalized the rule set learning problem as an
integer programming problem to balance classification accuracy
and rule simplicity. Column generation (CG) algorithms were used
to efficiently search for an exponential number of candidate clauses
(conjunctive or disjunctive terms) without the need for heuristic
rule mining. Yang et al. [61] approached rule set learning from
the perspective of submodular optimization. They formulate the
main problem as a task of selecting a subset from all possible rules,
while the subproblem of searching for rules is mapped as another
feature subset selection task. Since the objective function can be
formulated as the difference between two submodular functions, it
can be approximately solved by the optimization algorithm.
Most rule learning methods are used for classification tasks that
solely examine correlations. However, correlation does not imply
causation. A few researchers [ 6,42,56,60] have attempted to mine
causal rules from data. For example, CRE [ 6] and CRS [ 56] are
both two-stage methods, which first generates a pool of rules using
random forest, FP-Growth, etc., and then select a subset among them
based on some criteria, such as stability selection regularization. Li
et al. [42] first mined the association rules from the data and then
used a cohort study to test whether the association rules are causal
or not. However, these methods lack a global optimization objective;
therefore their results depend on the quality of the candidate rules
developed in the first stage.
Unlike earlier methods, we mine causal rules from observational
data from a unified optimization perspective. These rules represent
those subgroups with large treatment effects and low variance.
2.3 Subgroup Discovery
Subgroup discovery (SD) is a descriptive data mining technique
that identifies data subgroups with interesting patterns on spe-
cific targets. It differs slightly from rule learning that focuses on
prediction/classification performance on upcoming data. A com-
prehensive study of SD is available in reviews [3, 26].
Data subgroups can be represented using description languages
such as attribute-value pairs and different logical forms (e.g., con-
junctions, disjunctions, inequalities, fuzzy logic, etc.). Subgroupinterestingness can be measured using binary, nominal, or numeri-
cal targets. Certain post-processing methods have been applied to
select diverse and less redundant subgroups. Due to the enormous
number of potential subgroups, different search strategies, such as
exhaustive and heuristic search, have been applied.
The exhaustive method [ 5,21,22,58] searches all feasible sub-
groups. The naive exhaustive search may be time-consuming be-
cause the viable subgroup is exponential. Examples of strategies
for reducing hypothesis space include optimistic estimate pruning,
generalization-aware pruning, minimum support. SD-Map [ 5] is a
typical exhaustive SD method that extends the popular Frequent
Pattern (FP) Growth-based association rule mining method, utiliz-
ing depth-first search to generate candidates. Piatetsky-Shapiro,
unusualness, and binomial tests are utilized to determine precise
and significant subgroups. The SD-Map* [ 4] is extended for use
with binary, categorical, and continuous target variables.
Further studies [ 16,19,38,53,64] employed efficient heuristic
methods. For example, DSSD [ 53] is an SD algorithm based on
beam search. The search usually starts with an initial solution
and is then expanded to a certain number of candidate solutions.
The best ones are retained for the next iteration until a stopping
condition is reached. SDIGA [ 16] is an evolutionary fuzzy rule
induction algorithm. It facilitates the discovery of more general
rules by allowing variables to take multiple values. Subgroups can
be evaluated in terms of confidence, support, and unusualness.
SD is useful in many fields. For example, in medicine, it helps to
discover high-risk groups for a certain disease [ 36]. During opera-
tion and maintenance, it helps troubleshoot and attribute anomalies
in total KPI metrics to specific subgroups [ 9,23]. In marketing, it
helps to identify target customers of different brands [37].
However, conventional SD methods usually overlook the treat-
ment effect. Thus, this paper seeks to uncover subgroups with
significant treatment effects, which requires different optimization
objectives and evaluation criteria from prior SD methods.
3 PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we present some preliminaries about causal infer-
ence, submodular and supermodular functions.
Causal Inference. We introduce causal inference under the poten-
tial outcome (PO) framework [49].
Unit: A unit is an individual or object under study. A medical
study unit may be a patient. The subscript 𝑖denotes the 𝑖-th unit.
Treatment : A treatment is an intervention or exposure that
subjects to a unit. A new medicine or therapy could be used as a
treatment in a medical study. Let 𝑇indicate the treatment. 𝑇=1
units are the treatment group, while 𝑇=0units are the control
group. We assume one binary treatment for simplicity.
Outcomes: Outcomes are what would have happened under
different treatments. Each unit has two potential outcomes: fac-
tual outcome and counterfactual outcome. Potential outcome with
treatment value 𝑡is𝑌(𝑇=𝑡), also abbreviated as 𝑌(𝑡).
Covariates: Covariates are background variables that affect
treatment assignment and outcome. Observational studies often
control for covariates to mitigate confounding. Let X𝑖=(𝑥𝑖,1,···,𝑥𝑖,𝑑)
represent covariates.
4621KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Jiehui Zhou et al.
Observational data: Observational data refers to data collected
without the researcher manipulating the environment or the sub-
jects being studied. It differs from RCTs, which randomly assign
treatment to each unit. The observational data containing 𝑛units
is denoted byD={(𝑇𝑖,X𝑖,𝑌𝑖)}𝑛
𝑖=1.
Treatment effect refers to the impact of a treatment on an
outcome. For observational data, Inverse Probability Weighting
(IPW) [ 28] is proposed, which assigns appropriate weights 𝑤𝑖=
𝑇𝑖
𝑒𝑖+1−𝑇𝑖
1−𝑒𝑖to each unit based on propensity score 𝑒𝑖to balance co-
variates distribution in the treatment and control groups, thereby
simulating RCTs. Then, the normalized weighted average of the
factual outcomes for the treatment and control groups can be cal-
culated to estimate treatment effects [29]:
𝜏=Í
𝑖;𝑇𝑖=1𝑤𝑖𝑌𝑖Í
𝑖;𝑇𝑖=1𝑤𝑖−Í
𝑖;𝑇𝑖=0𝑤𝑖𝑌𝑖Í
𝑖;𝑇𝑖=0𝑤𝑖. (1)
When the data satisfy the three causal assumptions (unconfound-
edness, positivity and stable unit treatment value), it is shown that
the adjustment of the scalar propensity score removes the bias due
to the observed covariates [47].
Submodular and supermodular functions. A submodular function
is a set function with special properties. Its domain is a family of
subsets of a given set. The output value is some measure of the sub-
set. The inputs and outputs satisfy the relationship of diminishing
returns, i.e., the additional benefit of adding the set to the inputs
declines. The supermodular function is the opposite of the submod-
ular function, which satisfies the increasing returns. Formally, for
a set function 𝑓: 2Ω→R, it is submodular if:
∀𝐴⊆𝐵⊆Ωand𝑣∈Ω\𝐵,𝑓(𝐴∪{𝑣})−𝑓(𝐴)≥𝑓(𝐵∪{𝑣})−𝑓(𝐵).
Like the convexity in continuous optimization, submodularity
is a good property in discrete optimization, making it suitable for
many applications, such as approximation algorithms, game theory,
automatic summarization, and feature selection [32, 43].
4 PROBLEM FORMULATION
This section introduces the formalization of the causal rule learning
problem. The final optimization problem is presented in Eq. (4).
Without loss of generality, we consider observational data whose
covariates are binary and outcome is a positive number, i.e.,X𝑖=
(𝑥𝑖,1,···,𝑥𝑖,𝑑) ∈ { 0,1}𝑑,𝑌∈R>0. Categorical variables can be
binarized by one-hot encoding, and numerical variables can be con-
verted to binary by bucketing strategy. We determine the optimal
number of bins (4-20) using 5-fold cross-validation and select the
best-performing parameter for the final model. Negative outcomes
can be made positive by adding an offset.
Formally, given the observational data D, we aim to learn inter-
pretable causal rules from it. A causal ruleR:𝜶⇒𝜏contains
the antecedent 𝜶and the consequent 𝜏.
Aantecedent 𝜶is the condition of the rule, expressed as the
conjunctive normal form (CNF) of a series of atomsÓ
𝑗∈Γ𝑥𝑗,e.g.,
"age > 25 AND job != teacher". Γis the covariate indices used in the
antecedent, which is a subset of the indices of all binary covariates,
i.e.,Γ∈2[𝑑], where[𝑑]={1,···,𝑑}and2[𝑑]means the power set
of[𝑑]. The atom𝑥𝑗is the smallest interpretable element. We createthe negation of covariate ¬𝑥𝑗to increase the expressiveness. The
mapping from aRto a CNF is given by 𝜶R(X𝑖)=Ó
𝑗∈ΓR𝑥𝑖,𝑗. For
brevity, we also refer to it asÓ
𝑗∈R𝑥𝑖,𝑗. When 𝜶R(X𝑖)is true, the
𝑖-th unit is covered by the ruleR.
Theconsequent 𝜏is the prediction result of the rule, indicating
the estimated treatment effect for the data covered by the rule.
DefineDRto denote the covered data, D+to denote the data
that received the treatment ( 𝑇=1), andD−to denote the data
that did not receive the treatment ( 𝑇=0). DefineD+
R={𝑖|𝑖∈
D+∧𝜶R(X𝑖)=1}denotes the units in the treatment group that
are covered by the rule R,D−
R={𝑖|𝑖∈ D−∧𝜶R(X𝑖)=1}
denotes the units in the control group that are covered by the rule
R. Therefore, the treatment effect of rule Rcan be represented as:
𝜏R=Í

R𝑤𝑖,𝑄3=Í
𝑖∈D−
R𝑤𝑖𝑌𝑖,𝑄4=Í
𝑖∈D−
R𝑤𝑖.
Thecausal rule setS={R1,···,R𝑘}contains multiple rules.
A rule set covers a unit if 𝜶S(X𝑖)=Ô
R∈SÓ
𝑗∈R𝑥𝑖,𝑗is true. If a
unit is covered by more than one rule, we take the average of the
effects as the estimated treatment effect for that unit. However, an
interpretable ruleset should minimize rule overlap.
Since obtaining treatment effects is a statistical estimation prob-
lem, it is important to consider the uncertainty of the treatment
effect, which can be measured by the outcome variance of the
treatment group, defined as:
𝜎2
R=Í
𝑖∈D+
R𝑤𝑖(𝑌𝑖−𝑌𝑤)2
Í
𝑖∈D+
R𝑤𝑖, (3)
For the effect, we want𝑄1
𝑄2to be large,𝑄3
𝑄4to be small, and the
variance𝜎is also small. To facilitate the optimization, we take a
log for the ratio. Then we get the objective function 𝑓(R)=
log𝑄1+log𝑄4−log𝑄2−log𝑄3−𝜆log𝜎2
R, which is the profit of
a rule, and𝜆is a coefficient that adjusts for the trade-off between
treatment effect and variance. Therefore, to learn the causal rule
set from observational data, we consider solving the following
optimization problem:
max
S∑︁
R∈S𝑓(R)
s.t.|S|≤𝐾
|R|≤𝐿.(4)
To ensure interpretability, |S|≤𝐾restricts the number of rules in
the rule set to be no more than 𝐾, and|R|≤𝐿limits the antecedent
length of the rules to be no more than 𝐿.
5 ALGORITHM
In this section, we introduce the proposed algorithm CURLS for
solving the optimization problem in Eq. (4).
As shown in Fig. 2, to construct a precise causal rule set, we em-
ploy an iterative framework (Sec. 5.1), balancing constraints such as
set size and antecedent length. This methodical approach allows us
to sequentially select the most fitting rule, ensuring a coherent and
4622CURLS: Causal Rule Learning for Subgroups with Significant Treatment Effect KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
optimized causal rule set. Central to our strategy is the optimiza-
tion of a set function, which maps covariates to treatment effects,
requiring a nuanced balance between computational feasibility and
accuracy. We address this challenge by crafting an approximate
submodular lower bound for the objective function, a strategic
choice that simplifies the optimization process while maintain-
ing solution quality. Leveraging the minorize-maximization (MM)
procedure (Sec. 5.2) and submodular optimization(Sec. 5.3), we effi-
ciently derive each rule’s antecedents and consequents, resulting
in significant and interpretable causal rules.
5.1 Causal Rule Set Learning
Directly optimizing the rule set is not a trivial problem. Typical
correlation rule set learning algorithms usually adopt sequential
covering paradigms [ 13], that is, removing data covered by previous
rules and learning a new rule. However, this can easily result in
overlapping rules, thus affecting the interpretability of the rule set.
To solve this problem, instead of removing the covered data, we
explicitly introduce a penalty for overlapping data in the iterative
process, thus increasing the diversity of the rule set.
Overlap Penalty. Since the purpose of the causal rule is to cover
those units that have a strongly positive outcome after receiving
treatment, we can set the weighted outcome of the covered units
belonging to the treatment group to a smaller value 𝜖,i.e.,
𝑄1(R)=∑︁
𝑖∈D+
R\DS𝑤𝑖𝑌𝑖+∑︁
𝑖∈D+
R∩DS𝜖. (5)
Therefore, if the new rule Rsearches for units that have been
covered by the current rule set S, its estimated effect will be low,
and thus its probability of being selected during the optimization
process will decrease. The overall causal rule set learning process
is shown in Alg. 1.

5.2 MM Procedure
For a single rule, its maximization objective function is 𝑓(R). How-
ever, the complexity of 𝑓(R)makes it difficult for traditional opti-
mization algorithms to handle it directly. To this end, we propose
to use the MM procedure. It is an iterative optimization method
that, instead of finding the optimal solution to the original objective
function𝑓(R), first finds an easy-to-optimize surrogate function
𝑔(R)that approximates the original one (see Sec. 5.3 for detail).
The solution of the surrogate function makes the optimal solutionof𝑔(R)close to the optimal solution of 𝑓(R). In each iteration, a
new surrogate function for the next iteration is constructed based
on the current solution. Mathematically, the solution can converge
to the optimal solution to the original optimization problem [51].
Formally, taking the minorize-maximization version, 𝑓(R)is
the original objective function to be maximized. At the 𝑚−th (𝑚=
0,1,...) step of MM, the objective function 𝑓(R)can be replaced by
a surrogate function 𝑔𝑚(R)if the following conditions are satisfied:
𝑔𝑚(R)≤𝑓(R) ∀R
𝑔𝑚(R𝑚)=𝑓(R𝑚).(6)
Formmally, we summarize the steps of the MM procedure in Alg. 2.

5.3 Submodular Lower Bound Optimization
Here, we introduce how to construct a submodular approximation
lower bound of the original objective function and the correspond-
ing optimization method. Specifically, we aim to develop a rule R★
that maximizing 𝑓(R). First, we introduce the following inequality.

Each atom (covariate) of the antecedent in the rule corresponds
to a part of the unit, and the unit corresponding to the entire rule
is the intersection of the units corresponding to these atoms. Based
on the formula for 𝑄,𝑄can be viewed as the set function. Taking

R,
and the corresponding value is the sum of the weighted outcome of
these units. Then, we have the following property for 𝑄functions.

problem using efficient submodular optimization.
Proposition 2. 𝑄functions are supermodular.
Proof. Taking𝑄1as an example,D+
R={𝑖|𝑖∈D+∧𝜶R(X𝑖)=
1}={𝑖|𝑖∈ D+∧(∧ 𝑗∈R𝑥𝑖,𝑗)=1}. Thus𝑄1can be regarded
as the weighted outcome sum of set |D+∩(∩ 𝑗∈R𝑥𝑗)|. We can
rewrite it as|D+|−|D+∩(∩𝑗∈R𝑥𝑗)|=|D+|−|D+∩(∪ 𝑗∈R𝑥𝑗)|=
|D+|−|∪ 𝑗∈R(D+∩𝑥𝑗)|. The latter term is the union of sets
(coverage functions), which is a well-known submodular function,
so𝑄1is a supermodular function. Similarly, it can be shown that
other𝑄functions are also supermodular. □
For the supermodular function 𝑄: 2𝑉→R≥0, where𝑉=[𝑑]is
the universal set. The following modular functions gives two tight
lower bounds approximating 𝑄atR𝑚[45]:

𝑗∈R\R 𝑚𝑄(𝑗|R𝑚)≤𝑄(R),∀R⊆𝑉,(7)
where𝑄(𝐴|𝐵)=𝑄(𝐴∪𝐵)−𝑄(𝐵)denotes the marginal gain from
adding𝐴to𝐵. For ease of expression, we define
𝑏𝑄,R𝑚(R)=max(𝑏1
𝑄,R𝑚(R),𝑏2
𝑄,R𝑚(R)). (8)
Then we have the following result:
Proposition 3. The function 𝑔(R)defined below is a submodular
lower bound of 𝑓(R):
𝑔(R)=log𝑏𝑄1,R𝑚(R)+ log𝑏𝑄4,R𝑚(R)+𝜆log𝑏𝑄6,R𝑚(R)

𝑄3,R𝑚)
−𝜆(log𝑄5,R𝑚+𝑄5,R−𝑄5,R𝑚
𝑄5,R𝑚).
Proof. Since𝑏𝑄,R𝑚(R)is a modular function, then log𝑏𝑄,R𝑚(R)
is a submodular function. The first-order Taylor expansion of log𝑄
islog𝑄R𝑚+𝑄R−𝑄R𝑚
𝑄R𝑚, where𝑄R𝑚are constants, so−𝑄Ris a sub-
modular function. Thus, the 𝑔(R)is a submodular function. □For the submodular lower bound 𝑔(R), there exists an approxi-
mate local search algorithm [ 40] that approaches the optimum by
continuously performing local improvements. Specifically, starting
from the initial rule, 𝑔(R)is gradually maximized by local opera-
tions, including adding, removing, or replacing covariates. Formally,
the detailed algorithm procedures are summarized in Alg. 3.

6 EVALUATION
We present detailed experimental evaluation of CURLS , including
quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies.
6.1 Quantitative Experiments
The quantitative experiments aim to evaluate the efficacy of CURLS
in identifying significant treatment effects in subgroups. Since real-
world datasets lack the groundtruth of CATE, which affects the
calculation of evaluation metrics, we compare CURLS with various
baselines on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.
Datasets. For synthetic data, following the settings in [ 1,59], we
sampled units under the assumption of unconfoundedness, where
the covariates are generated from the following distribution:
𝑋1,···,𝑋𝑖∼Categorical({𝐴,𝐵,𝐶,𝐷,𝐸}),
𝑋𝑖+1,···,𝑋𝑑∼Normal(0,1).(9)
The treatment 𝑇is generated according to a Bernoulli distribu-
tion, where the probability of 𝑇=1is given by the sigmod function
4624CURLS: Causal Rule Learning for Subgroups with Significant Treatment Effect KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
with respect to 𝑋. This simulates the non-randomness of treatment
assignment in the observational data. Categorical variables are
converted to one-hot encoding for calculation. Formally, we have
𝑓(𝑋)=𝜎(⟨𝑋,𝛽⟩+𝜂),
𝜂∼Uniform(−1,1),
𝛽∼Uniform(0,𝑏)|𝑋|,
𝑇∼Bernoulli(𝑓(𝑋)).(10)
The treatment effect TEand the outcome 𝑌is generated by
the following formula. An offset is added to 𝑌to ensure that 𝑌is
positive. That is,
𝑇𝐸=⟨𝑋,𝛼⟩,𝛼∼Uniform(0,2)|𝑋|,
𝑌=𝑇·TE+⟨𝑋,𝛾⟩+𝑌offset+𝜖,
𝑌offset=max(0,−𝑌min),
𝜖∼Uniform(−1,1),𝛾∼Uniform(0,1)|𝑋|.(11)
We also collected the famous semi-synthetic dataset IHDP1,
which is constructed from the infant health and development pro-
gram. The detail information of the datasets is shown in Table 1.

Baselines. We compare the proposed algorithm CURLS with two
groups of algorithms. The first group is the popular heterogeneous
treatment effect estimation algorithms: (1) Causal Tree (CT) [ 1]; (2)
Causal Forest (CF) [ 55]; and (3) Causal Rule Ensemble (CRE) [ 6].
The second group is the correlation rule learning and subgroup
discovery algorithms: (1) BRCG [ 14]; (2) Decision Tree (DT) [ 10];
(3) Pysubgroup (PYS) [ 41]. In the first group, CRE can explicitly
obtain the antecedent and treatment effect of the rule. For CT and
CF, it can be considered that the path from the root to the leaf nodes
in the tree structure is the antecedent of the causal rule, and the
CATE value of the leaf node is the effect corresponding to the rule.
The second group of methods can only get the correlation rules.
In order to adapt to the setting of causal rule learning, we add a
post-processing step. CATE is calculated on the data covered by
each rule via the normalized IPW method [ 29]. For the consistency
of comparison, the rules with the top 𝐾effect values in the baselines
are taken out and compared with CURLS .
Metrics. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the causal
rules. On the one hand, we assess the subgroup treatment effect
from the perspectives of effect strength, uncertainty, and accu-
racy. The specific metrics are described as follows: (1) Estimated
CATE; (2) True CATE (mean value of ITE within subgroup); (3) The
variance of the outcome of the treated units in the subgroup. (4)

ing metrics: (1) Average length of rule antecedent; (2) Average
overlap between pairs of rules; (3) Rule set coverage.
Implement detail. We used 5-fold cross-validation and Bayesian
optimization to tune parameters. Specifically, we optimize the pa-
rameters of CURLS with max rule length 𝐿∈ {3,4,5,6}, vari-
ance weight 𝜆∈ {0.1,···,1.5}. CT’s hyperparameters include
cross-validation method cv.option=“matching” and pruning factor
pru_coef∈{0.4,0.9,1.5}. For CF, its hyperparameter takes the val-
ues num.trees∈{5,8,10}, honest version of the CT split.Honest=TRUE
and tradeoff between effect and variance split.alpha ∈{0.2,0.5,0.8}.
The CRE parameters include ntrees ∈{20,25}, max_depth∈{3,4}
and the decay threshold for rules pruning t_decay ∈{0.025,0.01,0.04}.
For DT, the depth of tree max_depth is fixed as 4. In PYS, the result
set has 10 rules, with a maximum rule depth of {2,5}, using the
subgroup scoring method qf=ps.WRAccQF(). For BRCG, we tune
the maximum number of columns generated per iteration K from 8
to 12, and the max rule length is chosen from {5,10}.
Results. The evaluation results are reported in Table 2. We
recorded the estimated CATE and the ground truth CATE (Avg_ITE)
to assess the strength of the treatment effect. The results show that
the estimated CATE and true CATE of both rules of CURLS is about
16.1% and 13.8% higher than the effect values of other baselines.
We also observe that for correlation learning methods, such as DT
and PYS, the highest effect is not the rule with a high predicted
value of𝑌(in our experiment, it is the rules with the probability of
𝑌around 0.6-0.8), which reflects the difference between correlation
and causation. When it comes to variance, CURLS reduces variance
by about 12.0% compared to other baselines. In addition, CURLS
sacrifices certain effects to reduce variance when necessary. For
example, in rule2 of data3, the effect and variance of CURLS are
12.47 and 16.36, while the effect of PYS and BRCG are 12.91 and
13.90, respectively, which are larger than CURLS , but their variance
is also large at 21.92 and 23.58. We also compared PEHE and MAPE,
which measure the accuracy of ITE estimates. The results show that
the estimation accuracy of CURLS is, on average, 0.05% higher on
PEHE and 1.6% smaller on MAPE compared to the other methods.
This suggests that CURLS is able to find subgroups with more sig-
nificant treatment effects with similar or better estimation accuracy.
It is worth noting that while CATE is the best estimate of ITE in
terms of the mean squared error [ 33], it can also lead to inaccurate
estimates because the estimation method we used, IPW, inherently
has errors in estimating when the propensity score approaches 0
or 1. A potential solution is to introduce more robust estimators,
such as doubly robust estimation [18].
Table 3 shows the relevant metrics on the rule set readability.
We found that the average rule length of CURLS is around 3, which
is mostly smaller than tree-based methods such as CT and CF. In
addition, the overlap between rules in CURLS is also at a low level
of 0.1%, which is favorable for user understanding. The coverage
metric shows that CURLS focuses on a small number of groups
with strong effects, while other methods, like CT and CRE, have
coverage rates as high as more than 50%. However, the variance of
their coverage is also very large, indicating that there are significant
differences between their rules. Also, the high coverage may be
responsible for their more average treatment effects.

6.2 Case Studies
We qualitatively evaluate the performance of CURLS on two real
and easily understandable accident analysis and policy making
datasets. The Titanic dataset2provides passenger data on survival,
sex, age, fares, number of siblings/spouses on board (sibsp) and
number of parents/children (parch) etc.We want to determine how
premium class (treatment) affects passenger survival (outcome). For
the treatment, 𝑇=1means that the passenger is in premium class 1
2https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/dataand 2 cabins, and 𝑇=0means the lowest class 3 cabin. We extracted
three causal rules from the dataset; the first shows that upgrading
to a higher class improves survivability for passengers with more
family members, who may be more willing to aid each other. The
second and third rules correspond to the fact that women and
children who pay higher ticket fees are more likely to be rescued
due to the abundant rescue resources in the higher class and the
“women and children first” policy.
The Lalonde dataset (part of the famous Jobs dataset) [ 35] in-
cludes data from participants and non-participants in a job training
program (National Supported Work Demonstration, NSW). NSW is
an experimental program that aims to help economically disadvan-
taged people (e.g., long-term unemployed, high school dropouts) re-
turn to work. It would train underprivileged workers in work skills
for 9-18 months. We evaluated how the training program (treat-
ment) affected income (outcome). The covariates include individual
background information (age, race, academic background, and past
income). Table 4 reveals two subgroups with high treatment effects
yielded by CURLS . The first subgroup is married people over 29
who may be living a stressful life and will study hard to increase
their income during training. The second subgroup is 18-19-years-
olds. They have good learning capacity and ambition, so they can
get high-paying employment through training despite their lack of
experience. We used DoWhy3, a famous causal inference package,
to calculate the treatment effect for the entire population, which is
1639.8, less than half of the two mentioned subgroups. With refer-
ence to causal rules, policymakers can better choose target groups
to improve program implementation outcomes.

In this section, we discuss the implications, scalability, limitations
and future work of CURLS .

Implications. This research leads to two key implications. Firstly,
causal rule learning is helpful, and exploration of its algorithmic
design is encouraging. The concise rules in the form of "IF-THEN"
are similar to the logic of human decision-making. They are easier
to understand compared to complicated tree structures and black-
box methods for treatment effect estimation, making it simpler to
discover new causal knowledge. Secondly, CURLS can be adopted in
practical applications, as our real-world data cases demonstrate. In
addition to those examples, CURLS can also be adapted to scenarios
requiring causal-assisted decision-making, such as education and
industry. For example, CURLS may help teachers find the best way
to teach different students based on their characteristics. It may
also assist quality inspectors troubleshoot metric anomalies and
attribute them to specific models.
Scalability. The computational complexity of CURLS is mainly
dominated by local search in Alg. 3, which is linear in the number
of covariates. To demonstrate this empirically, we conducted an
experiment to measure the algorithm running time under different
numbers of covariates and units. As shown in Fig. 3, the training
time grows linearly with the number of covariates.
Figure 3: Scalability test. Training time scales linearly with
the number of covariates.
Limitations and future work. We believe there are three po-
tential directions that CURLS can further explore. First, CURLS may
converge to suboptimal results due to its iterative optimization
procedure, where poor initialization and iteration paths can lead to
local optima. To address this, we use a greedy strategy for initial-
ization for MM and incorporate local search techniques at the end.
We are also exploring other optimization methods, such as neural
combinatorial optimization [ 8] and multi-objective learning [ 50],
to further improve the quality of the final solution. Second, the de-
scriptive ability of antecedents is limited. While CURLS uses a form
of CNF with AND logical connectives and binary covariates, itsinability to handle OR connectives and limitations in discretization
may restrict it from describing certain refined subgroups. Future
work involves integrating logical connectives into the learning
process and adaptively determining the discretization. Finally, the
assumptions on single treatment and single outcome may not be
compatible with real-world scenarios. In practice, there may be
multiple treatments, unobserved variables, multiple outcomes, or
more complex causal relationships. For non-binary treatments, we
can extend our method by utilizing One-Versus-The-Rest (OvR),
which is commonly used for multi-classification tasks, to handle
each treatment value. Other methods such as robust HTE [ 31] and
instrumental variables [ 52] can also be investigated to ensure the
validity of causal inference.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a new method called CURLS for learning
causal rules from observational data. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first method that employs an optimization problem to gen-
erate rules to explain subgroups with significant treatment effects.
We formally define these causal rules composed of antecedents that
form conditions to characterize the subgroup and the associated ef-
fects. We model the rule learning process as a discrete optimization
problem. By constructing an approximate submodular lower bound
for the original objective, the problem can be solved iteratively
based on the minorize-maximization algorithm. Quantitative exper-
iments and qualitative case studies demonstrate that our method is
effective in identifying meaningful causal rules from observational
data. Future works involve more effective optimization algorithms,
refining rule formation, and addressing more complex scenarios.

A SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTS
The above experiments compares CURLS to popular tree-based
CATE methods (CT, CF), causal rule learning method (CRE), sub-
group discovery methods (DT, PYS), and rule learning method
(BRCG). The path from the root to the leaf nodes can be viewed as
a description of the subgroups in these tree- or rule-based methods,
whereas other black-box causal heterogeneity or uplift modelingmodels usually lack interpretability and are not used for the compar-
ison. As a workaround, we supplemented new baselines, including
double machine learning, doubly robust, and orthogonal random
forest. We train a decision tree on the effects of these estimators
using Tree Interpreter from a popular causal inference package,
EconML [ 7], to indirectly obtain subgroup descriptions. New base-
lines includes:
•LDML: The double machine learning estimator with a low-
dimensional linear final stage implemented as a statsmodel
regression.
•DRL: CATE estimator that uses doubly-robust correction
techniques to account for covariate shift (selection bias) be-
tween the treatment arms.
•DROF: Orthogonal random forest for discrete treatments
using the doubly robust moment function.
As shown in Table 5, CURLS still achieves competitive perfor-
mance, being able to identify subgroups described by rules with
stronger treatment effects and smaller outcome variance, while
maintaining similar PEHE and MAPE accuracies.
The evaluation results of the interpretability metrics are shown in
Table 6, in which the average length of the rules of CURLS is shorter
and the overlap rate is small, which helps users to understand. In
addition, the coverage rate shows that CURLS can find more fine-
grained subgroups with significant treatment effects.

lines, reported as mean and standard deviation.

we have shown that 𝑔(R)is submodular. Since the parts of 𝑔(R)
are either increasing (e.g., 𝑄3,R) or decreasing (e.g., −𝑄2,R) with
