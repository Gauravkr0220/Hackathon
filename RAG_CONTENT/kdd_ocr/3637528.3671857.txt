ABSTRACT
Fine-grained entity typing (FET) is the task of identifying specific
entity types at a fine-grained level for entity mentions based on
their contextual information. Conventional methods for FET require
extensive human annotation, which is time-consuming and costly
given the massive scale of data. Recent studies have been developing
weakly supervised or zero-shot approaches. We study the setting of
zero-shot FET where only an ontology is provided. However, most
existing ontology structures lack rich supporting information and
even contain ambiguous relations, making them ineffective in guid-
ing FET. Recently developed language models, though promising
in various few-shot and zero-shot NLP tasks, may face challenges
in zero-shot FET due to their lack of interaction with task-specific
ontology. In this study, we propose OnEFET, where we (1) enrich
each node in the ontology structure with two categories of extra in-
formation: instance information for training sample augmentation
andtopic information to relate types with contexts, and (2) develop
a coarse-to-fine typing algorithm that exploits the enriched infor-
mation by training an entailment model with contrasting topics
and instance-based augmented training samples. Our experiments
show that OnEFET achieves high-quality fine-grained entity typing
without human annotation, outperforming existing zero-shot meth-
ods by a large margin and rivaling supervised methods. OnEFET
also enjoys strong transferability to unseen and finer-grained types.

1 INTRODUCTION
Fine-grained entity typing (FET) aims to identify the nuanced types
of entity mentions within their respective contexts. Serving as
a foundational task in text mining, FET plays a pivotal role in
converting unstructured data into structured ones by means of
entity-linking [ 3,47], information extraction [ 16,59], and knowl-
edge graph construction [ 36]. Due to its fundamental role and
importance, FET has been researched extensively [46].
FET usually requires typing on a confined label space (e.g., a
hierarchical structure of ontology including coarse-grained types
and fine-grained ones). Hence, it is time-consuming and labor-
intensive to acquire annotations for entity mentions given the huge
amount of data. To mitigate the label scarcity issue, some studies [ 4,
7,20,55] explored distantly supervised FET to denoise pseudo labels
incorporated from external or parametric knowledge bases. Recent
studies made attempts in both few-shot [ 4,14] and zero-shot [ 5,25]
settings where the model is provided with the label hierarchy and
optional example annotations for each type. Our work focuses on
zero-shot FET, where no annotation for training data is given.
An ontology is a structural view of concepts representing rela-
tions among them [ 26,39,42]. For zero-shot FET, existing methods
typically leverage the ontology structure to accurately characterize
the label space [ 11,52]. Several studies integrate ontology structure
with external knowledge sources such as Wikipedia label descrip-
tions [ 23,29,58]. However, these approaches often require substan-
tial human annotations on the source domain or manually selected
representative mentions. The recent development of large language
models (LLMs) has shed new light on FET. These models possess
remarkable text representation capabilities [ 9] and can serve as ex-
tensive knowledge sources [ 31,33]. However, though showcasing
incredible ability in general zero-shot tasks [ 57], their performance
on zero-shot FET [ 34] is not satisfactory as we will elaborate in
Section 5.3 later. This is partly because as the ontology layer goes
deeper and the entity types become more fine-grained, language
models face increasing challenges in distinguishing between these

types due to their subtle semantic differences. The occurrence fre-
quencies of fine-grained types in the pre-trained corpus are also
lower. Hence, how to fully interpret andleverage the structure of
the ontology plays a decisive role in zero-shot FET.
In this paper, we present a novel zero-shot FET framework to
enrich the ontology structure by incorporating instance and topic
information, and design a coarse-to-fine typing algorithm that ef-
fectively utilizes the enriched information. Specifically, we first
enrich the original ontology structure with two categories of in-
formation in the form of words and phrases (shown in Table 1):
(i)instance information gives concrete demonstrations of a spe-
cific type, which are crucial for training sample augmentation and
(ii)topic information provides type-associated key phrases to
distinguish contexts of similar fine-grained types. Based on the
automatically-enriched ontology, our coarse-to-fine entity typing
algorithm generates pseudo-training sentences containing enriched
instances, by incorporating reward and penalty mechanisms into
language model decoding. Then we model entity typing as a natural
language inference (NLI) [ 18,20] task, where we train the entail-
ment model with contrasting topic information to interpret the
fine-grained hierarchical semantics. The proposed framework is
evaluated on three challenging fine-grained entity typing bench-
marks to verify its effectiveness.
To sum up, this study contributes to the state-of-the-art of fine-
grained entity typing in the following aspects:
(1)We propose to automatically enrich the existing ontology
structure, where two types of information, instances and
topics are leveraged to help describe and distinguish the
semantics of fine-grained types.
(2)We design a zero-shot and ontology-guided entity typing
framework to make good use of the enriched information.
By generating instance-based pseudo-training data and mod-
eling entity typing as an NLI task, we are able to better
distinguish fine-grained entity types and encode label de-
pendency.
(3)Empirical studies verify the general effectiveness of our
method on fine-grained entity typing. We also conduct com-
prehensive analyses for interpreting the performance of
OnEFET, hoping to shed light on future related research.(4)We also demonstrate that OnEFET can work on different
test sets, so that OnEFET is free to apply to unseen and even
more fine-grained types.
2 PROBLEM FORMULATION
Fine-grained entity typing (FET) [ 22] aims to determine the type
of an entity based on its context. The input is a text sequence of
length𝑇,𝑥={𝑤1,...,m,...,𝑤 𝑇}, where m={𝑤𝑖,...,𝑤 𝑗}is an entity
mention consisting of (𝑗−𝑖+1)tokens. The output is an entity
type label𝑦∈Y indicating the entity type of mfrom a pre-defined
set of entity types. In this paper, we focus on the situation where
Yforms a hierarchical structure, i.e., ontology, which consists of
both coarse and fine-grained types. For all the datasets used in
this paper, the ontology is a multiway tree, where the upper nodes
denote coarse-grained types. The edges in the tree represent the
relation of “is-a”. An example is visualized in the left part of Figure 1.
In zero-shot settings, the annotated labels are not available.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we detail the framework of OnEFET, which consists
of two parts: (1) ontology enrichment with instance and topic in-
formation, and (2) zero-shot coarse-to-fine typing algorithm. We
will first automatically enrich the given ontology structure with
topic words and instances. The instances are then used to generate
pseudo-training samples for the zero-shot setting, where the top-
ics are infused to train a natural language inference (NLI) model.
During the inference stage, we iteratively employ the NLI model in
a coarse-to-fine manner in the ontology structure until we finally
reach the answer. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1.
3.1 Automatic Ontology Enrichment
Despite the “is-a” relation existing in ontology structures, we argue
that enrichment in an ontology using instances and topics could
really help distinguish fine-grained types. Examples of enrichment
for both instances and topics are displayed in Table 1.
Enrichment for Topic Information. Topic words and phrases
are indicatives of the contextual understanding, and help to disam-
biguate between different entity types that appear similar [ 1]. For

Figure 1: OnEFET framework. The left part is the ontology enrichment for instance and topic information. Then we leverage
instances to generate pseudo-training data. Together with topics, we train an NLI model, which will support coarse-to-fine
typing during the inference stage.
example, entity types such as biologist and chemist may seem simi-
lar, but topic words related to each type such as {genetics, ecology,
viruses, animals } and {elements, molecules, equilibrium, catalysts }
can improve the contextual understanding and better distinguish
these two types. We employ SeeTopic [ 53], an unsupervised frame-
work to generate topics using entity types 𝑦in the label spaceY
as query words. Specifically, SeeTopic1takes a text corpus, a set
of seeds (query words), and a PLM as input, and outputs the set of
topic words/phrases corresponding to each seed in the input. By
taking every type node as a seed, we first select the top 20 related
documents in a large Wikipedia2corpus by implementing Elastic-
search [ 19]. By only compiling documents related to the query node,
we reduce noisy results and can extract relevant topics without
intensive memory usage. The retrieved documents serve as the text
corpus. We run SeeTopic based on the PLM BERT-base[ 9], which
will return the related topics corresponding to each seed. Impor-
tantly, SeeTopic supports out-of-vocabulary search by looking for
semantically similar queries via PLM embeddings. This is necessary
for automating the process since some entity types are not in the
vocabulary of a PLM such as “fraternity_sorority”.
Enrichment for Instance Information. Instances are concrete
examples of entity types that are in the ontology tree structure. This
level of granularity helps detailed classification within a broader
categorical structure [ 45], thus enhancing the understanding of
fine-grained entity types. We leverage SECoExpan3[54] on the
Wikipedia corpus to generate instances, which are divided into
the following two stages: (1) using LM-based prompting using
question-answering templates [ 15] for instance seeds curation, and
(2) employing SECoExpan over the previously generated seeds to
expand instances with the Wikipedia corpus.
1https://github.com/yuzhimanhua/SeeTopic
2https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
3https://github.com/yuzhimanhua/SETypeFor seed generation, we leverage the question-answering frame-
work and the given Wikipedia corpus. Providing the entity type
𝑇, we first retrieve related sentences in Wikipedia with 𝑇as query
words. For every retrieved sentence ⟨𝑆⟩we curate a question-
answering template inspired by [15] as follows:
[CLS]What is the instance of ⟨𝑇⟩in this sentence?[SEP] ⟨𝑆⟩[SEP]
Here, [CLS] is the special classification token, and [SEP] is the
special token for separation. 𝑇denotes the entity type indicated,
⟨𝑆⟩is the retrieved sentence in Wikipedia. An example is shown in
the following:
[CLS] What is the instance of ⟨𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑒⟩in this sentence? [SEP] Lepa
Shandy was a Nigerian Yoruba movie that was produced by Bayowa
and eventually became a very successful project. [SEP]
In the above example, the answer would be “Lepa Sandy”. We
proceed with this process for 𝑛times to get the 𝑛total instance
seeds for every type 𝑇in the ontology structure.
After obtaining instance seeds, we feed them into SECoExpan to
automatically mine a sufficient amount of instances for each entity
type Tbased on them.
3.2 Coarse-to-fine Typing
This section presents our ontology-guided zero-shot approach OnE-
FETbased on the restructured ontology. The overall architecture
is shown in the right part of Figure 1. Building FET models typ-
ically requires training sequence labeling models that recognize
entities of specific types under given contexts. First, we construct
contextualized training samples for each fine-grained type based on
their context-free enriched instances. We then train an entailment
model with the enriched information from topic words/phrases to
distinguish the fine-grained types. During test time, we make final
predictions by inferring with the entailment model in a top-down
recursive manner following the ontology structure.
 
2320KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Siru Ouyang et al.
Contextualized Training Data Construction. We propose to
construct contextualized training samples [ 27] for each type by
leveraging an LLM to generate a sentence that contains an instance
𝒆belonging to that certain type. One intuitive way for generation
is to use the instance 𝒆as the starting word/phrase. However, such
an approach can only create sentences with the instance being
at a fixed position, while entities could appear at the beginning,
middle, or end of sentences in real practice. Therefore, we propose a
rewarding mechanism in LM decoding to generate diverse training
samples that contain the instance 𝒆. Specifically, we use a multiplier
to rescale the logits 𝒍𝑖of each token 𝑥𝑖at the output softmax layer:
𝑝G(𝑥𝑖|𝒙<𝑖)=exp(𝒍𝑖/𝜔)
Í|𝑉|
𝑗=1exp(𝒍𝑗/𝜔), (1)
𝜔= 
𝜏𝛼 𝑥 𝑖∈𝒆∧𝑥𝑖∉𝒙<𝑖
𝜏𝛽 𝑥 𝑖∈𝒙<𝑖
𝜏 else, (2)
where𝜔>0is the sampling temperature ( 𝜔→0approximates
greedily picking the most probable next token; 𝜔→∞ induces
a uniform distribution); 𝛼and𝛽are scaling hyperparameters of
𝜏>0: we set𝛼>1to encourage tokens in the target entity 𝒆to
have a higher probability of getting generated, and we set 𝛽<1to
discourage the generation of repetitive tokens already appearing in
the sequence 𝒙<𝑖to mitigate degenerate repetition, a common issue
in text generation. In our experiments, we employ CTRL [ 17], a 1.6B
generative language model for generation and choose “Wikipedia”
as the generation style. We select the generated sentences with a
higher conditional generation probability than the average [ 27],
and filter out samples that do not contain the given instance.
Following the architecture of NLI [ 2], we construct training
samples for NLI labels with respect to the ontology structure, and
contrastively train an entailment model for fine-grained type pre-
diction. Taking the generated sentence 𝒙as the “premise”, the “hy-
pothesis” is a statement “[instance] is a [entity type]”. If the entity
type is the original one that generates the instance, the label is set
asEntailment. For Contradiction labels, we choose the fine-grained
entity type in other branches. Neutral labels are paired with coarse-
grained entity types in the same branch to help better distinguish
coarse-grained information from fine-grained one.
Training Paradigm. With the generated dataset, we are now able
to train an entailment model together with topics to further cap-
ture the nuances in fine-grained entity types. Specifically, we build
upon the RoBERTa [ 24] model with the Transformers [ 41] archi-
tecture. The topics are concatenated and sent to the encoder to
get embedding 𝐻𝑡. Then a gated attention module is designed to
incorporate the topic information (during inference, we use the
keywords/phrases in the context as an approximation to topics):
𝜆=𝜎(𝑊𝜆𝐻𝑡+𝑈𝜆𝐻𝑐) (3)
where𝑊𝜆and𝑈𝜆are learnable parameters, and 𝐻𝑐is the context
embedding of the input sentence. 𝐻𝑐and𝐻𝑡are then fused for an
effective representation ˜𝐻=𝐻𝑐+𝜆𝐻𝑡.
One challenge for training the entailment model on the synthetic
dataset is that the generated samples may contain noises. Standard
supervised training on noisy datasets may raise the risk of overfit-
ting and degraded performance since some easy categories convergeTable 2: Detailed statistics of the three fine-grained entity
typing datasets.

faster than hard categories. To improve the noise-robustness of en-
tailment model training for better generalization, we simply apply a
noise-robust loss, generalized cross-entropy (GCE) loss [ 56], which
incorporates 𝑞-order entropy [10] into the standard cross-entropy
loss. Specifically, the calculation of GCE loss for the entailment

mates the standard cross-entropy loss.
4 EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. In our experiments, we use a wide range of fine-grained
entity typing datasets, including OntoNotes [ 12], BBN [ 43], and
FIGER [ 22], to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
The detailed statistics of three datasets are shown in Table 2. Note
that we are directly inferring the test sets in zero-shot settings.
•OntoNotes. The OntoNotes dataset is derived from the OntoNotes
corpus [ 44] and 12,017 manual annotations were done by [ 13]
with 3hierarchical layers of 89fine-grained types. We follow
the dataset split by [ 40] that retains 8,963 non-pronominal anno-
tations, where the training set is automatically extracted from
Freebase API by [38].
•BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type Corpus (BBN).
This dataset uses 2,311 Wall Street Journal articles and is anno-
tated by [ 43] with 2hierarchical layer of 46types. We follow
the split by [ 38] and also filter out classes with less than 5anno-
tations in training, validation, and test set, leading to a total of
25classes.
•FIGER The FIGER dataset contains 2M data samples labeled
with 113types. The dev set and the test set include 1,000 and
562 samples respectively. Within its label space, 82types have
a dependency relation with their ancestor or descendant types
while the other 30types are uncategorized free-form words.
Baselines. We compare our framework with baselines from two set-
tings: (i) supervised and distantly-supervised fine-grained methods,
and (ii) zero-shot fine-grained methods.
For supervised and distantly supervised fine-grained entity typ-
ing, we have the following baselines:

•AFET [37] proposes a method for embedding both clean and
noisy entity references individually. The technique leverages
a defined type hierarchy to formulate loss functions and inte-
grates them into a unified optimization problem to calculate the
embeddings of references and type paths.
•UFET [6] predicts open types without a pre-defined label struc-
ture and is trained using a multi-objective approach that com-
bines supervision from the headwords and prior information
from entity linking in Wikipedia.
•BERT-MLMET [8] is a model that starts with BERT-base and
fine-tunes it using supervision from headwords and entity-type
hypernyms extracted from Hearst patterns. The resulting model
is used to predict ultra-fine entity types and produce fine-grained
entity types by means of a simple type mapping process.
•LITE [20] borrows indirect supervision from NLI to perform
entity typing. It also involves a type-ranking module to help
with generalizing prediction with disjoint type sets.
For zero-shot fine-grained entity typing baselines, we have the
following baselines:
•OTyper [51] is a neural network trained on a limited training
dataset in shallow levels of ontology. This model is then evalu-
ated on the open named entity typing task, which is zero-shot
since the fine-grained target types are not known in advance.
•ZOE [58] uses a new type taxonomy defined as Boolean func-
tions of Freebase types and determines the type of a given entity
reference by linking it to the type-compatible Wikipedia entries.
•DZET [29] leverages the type descriptions available from Wiki-
pedia to build a distributed semantic representation of the types
and aligns the target entity mention and their corresponding
type representations onto the known types.
•MZET [52] leverages the semantic meaning and the hierarchical
structure into the type representation. With a memory compo-
nent to model the relationship between the entity mentions andtypes, the method transfers the knowledge from seen types to
label the unseen types.
•ChatGPT [30] is a generative large language model aiming for
generic AI applications. Pre-trained on the large-scale corpus
with reinforcement learning techniques, ChatGPT provides a
richer knowledge source for entity typing.
•OntoType [18] is an ontology-guided framework that lever-
ages the weak supervision of pre-trained language models and
headwords to match the fine-grained types in the ontology.
Experimental details. For each type in the ontology structure,
we enrich 30instances and 5topics. The number of enriched topics
directly adopts the hyperparameter choices from the original topic
discovery paper [ 53], which finds that the quality of top-5 terms is
mostly reliable and contains less noise. For the number of instances,
we experiment with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50, with the detailed perfor-
mance shown Table 4. Setting a number equaling 30 achieves the
best results. Potential reasons are (i) we need a sufficient number of
pseudo samples in training, and 30 ensures a good number of sam-
ples, (ii) too many samples (e.g., 40 or 50 instances) could increase
noises (e.g., intrusion between some categories). Also, generating
top-40 and top-50 instances per type could take a longer time for
instance generation. Note that each type does not always have
30instances, which is due to the characteristics of each type. For
example, “railway” and “time” do not have 30 instances. The total
number of instances enriched and the original number of nodes
are shown in Table 2. When generating pseudo-training data, we
generate 1 contradiction and 1 neutral case for each sample. In this
case for neutral, only the direct ancestor is used. When training
the entailment model, we set the number of epochs to 10, and the
learning rate to 1𝑒−5. It takes 1hour to run our method for training
a RoBERTa [ 24] model with 2 Nvidia A6000 GPUs, and around 20
minutes to do inference for OntoNotes. Note that the inference time
varies with respect to different numbers of test samples. Results are
evaluated based on the metrics described in Appendix A.

4.2 Results
Table 3 presents the performance of all methods on the test set of
three benchmark datasets. All the best results are shown in bold.
Based on the results, we have the following observations:
(1)OnEFET achieves superior performance on almost all the datasets
with dramatic improvements compared with zero-shot baselines.
Specifically, OnEFET achieves an absolute improvement of +2.9,
+2.9,+1.9on Accuracy, Micro-F1, and Macro-F1 respectively on
the OntoNotes dataset, compared with the previous state-of-the-art
zero-shot entity typing model 𝑂𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒 . For the BBN dataset, OnE-
FET also achieves a consistent performance with a performance
boost of+7.7,+5.4, and+6.8accordingly compared with 𝑍𝑂𝐸 . For
the FIGER dataset, we fall a little behind 𝑍𝑂𝐸 on Accuracy and
Micro-F1 scores. Nevertheless, we achieved a +3.5gain on the
Macro-F1 score. We also observe that OnEFET is competitive com-
pared with supervised or distantly-supervised methods.
(2)We find that the improvement in metric Macro-F1 is much
better than that of Micro-F1. Macro-F1 weights every class equally
by first calculating 𝑃Maand𝑅Maand then taking the average over
classes. Conversely, Micro-F1 weights every sample equally. The
results indicate that OnEFET not only boosts the performance for
the majority class labels such as “/person” and “/organization”, but
also further enhances the typing accuracy on minority class labels
such as “/event/war” by a large margin.
(3)We also investigate the performance against a recent LLM, Chat-
GPT, by evaluating fine-grained entity typing through OpenAI API
“gpt-3.5-turbo”. Specifically, we use the instruction “ Give the fine-
grained entity types of the given entity mentioned in the sentences
below. Be concise and you can ONLY use types from this list of possible
entity types.[sentence] {sentence} [entity mention] {entity mention} ”.
We give 3 demonstrations to help with typing. As shown in Table 3,
ChatGPT, though deemed promising, proved unsatisfactory in fine-
grained entity typing. The reasons are twofold. Firstly, LLMs such
as ChatGPT do not have the background of type structure, i.e., on-
tology, and instead tend to generate free-form entity types, which
could be noisy. Also, though we provide strict demonstrations as
templates, LLMs tend to generate redundant sentences as output,
which limits their accuracy.
(4)We are curious about the phenomenon as to why OnEFET sur-
passes ZOE by a large margin on OntoNotes and BBN datasets, but
falls a little behind on the FIGER dataset. One of the reasons is that
there are many nested entity typing problems existing in FIGER
dataset. Consider the following example: “Nine of the individuals
elected are UW faculty members.” ZOE directly grounds UW in
the corresponding Wikipedia entries and will obtain “/organiza-
tion/educational_institution” almost surely. However, in OnEFET,
we leverage prompting predictions as a major source, which may
lead to a contextualized understanding of “UW faculty members”Table 5: Ablation studies for different components in OnE-
FET. The Accuracy and F1 scores are evaluated with the test
set of the OntoNotes dataset.

and type “UW” with coarse-grained type “/person”. We provide a
more detailed error analysis in Section 5.3.
5 ANALYSIS
5.1 Ablation Study
To dive into the effectiveness of different components in OnEFET,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the test set of OntoNotes.
Table 5 summarizes the results.
Effect of topical enrichment. We explored how performance
changes when topics are removed. As shown in Table 5, the perfor-
mance decreases when we use generated plain text for NLI training,
and do not take keywords/phrases into consideration during in-
ference. This result attests to the notion that topical enrichment
contributes significantly to understanding and resolving complex
semantic relationships in NLI tasks.
Effect of enrichment for instances. We also explored how in-
stance enrichment influences performance. Notably, the training
data are constructed from instance information, without which the
framework could not be complete as in a zero-shot setting. There-
fore, we conducted experiments where only 3 instances were used
for training data construction, to approximate the ablation results.
The enriched ablation results are shown in Table 5. This indicates
that instances also contribute to the final performance.
Effect of inference style. To investigate how coarse-to-fine infer-
ence on ontology contributes to the final performance, we conduct
another experiment where we treat all the nodes in the ontology at
one plain level without any hierarchy. We notice that the perfor-
mance does not drop as much as we expect, since the traditional
NLI model may give more weight to safe answers as coarse-grained
types. The potential reason could be our contrastive label design
when training the NLI model, which improves the model’s ability
to capture fine-grained information.
Effect of loss function design. We also tested how the design of
GCE loss affects the performance. In this experiment, we replace
the GCE loss with traditional cross-entropy loss and everything
else remains the same. As shown in Table 5, replacing GCE loss
leads to worse performance, and even less accuracy than removing
topics. This confirms the necessity of using a noise-tolerant training
setting. The reason is that GCE loss can prevent the model from
overfitting to false negative labels, thus improving the performance.
5.2 Transferibility Test
To demonstrate OnEFET’s ability in entity typing to unseen and
even more fine-grained samples, we employ the UFET benchmark

dataset [ 6] for comparison. The UFET dataset consists of two parts,
human-labeled data with 5994 instances split into train/dev/test by
1:1:1, and distant supervision data including 5.2M instances that
are automatically labeled by external knowledge bases. There are a
total of 10,331 ultra-fine-grained types that are not organized in an
ontology. We treat all the types as plain. During inference, we will go
over all the types one by one to obtain the NLI label. We focus on the
human-labeled data with 1,998 test samples in a zero-shot setting,
and follow the original design to evaluate loose macro-averaged
precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score. “Direct NLI” refers to the
baseline4that is pre-trained on the Multi-Genre Natural Language
Inference (MNLI) corpus, and then predicted directly without any
tuning on the test set. We also introduce the previous state-of-the-
art (distantly) supervised models as references. We introduce two
ways to apply OnEFET to the UFET dataset: (i) directly employ
the trained NLI model with FET datasets to UFET datasets (direct
OnEFET); (ii) first generate pseudo training data for each type5and
then train a new NLI model with these data (OnEFET).
The results are shown in Table 6. We observe that directly em-
ploying the previously trained NLI model already achieves com-
petitive performance against the baseline model NLI, which ver-
ifies OnEFET’s ability to distinguish fine-grained types. There is
still a gap between previous supervised state-of-the-art methods
due to the difficulty and massive unseen, ultra-fine-grained types.
Additionally, we observe a massive performance increase when
5instances (training samples) are generated for each type in Ul-
traFine. Although we are still around 10points of F1 behind the
state-of-the-art model, we have achieved the best performance of
Recall so far. This is due to the characteristics of NLI models, which
tend to give more answers that they think are suitable. Despite this,
OnEFET still demonstrates its superiority considering that this is
actually a 5-shot training in comparison with full fine-tuning of
state-of-the-art models.
5.3 Error Analysis of OnEFET and ChatGPT
To shed light on how to further improve OnEFET, we examine the
bottleneck of the method by conducting an error analysis here.
Specifically, we randomly sampled 100cases from the OntoNotes
test set, and categorized the error cases in the following four types.
Type I: insufficient world knowledge. Model lacks the com-
monsense knowledge for the given entity to correctly infer the
corresponding type. Type II: Incorrect fine-grained inference.
4https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-large-mnli
5Since the label space is large, we generate 5 training samples for each entity type.
Figure 2: Error types and the corresponding proportions.
We manually annotate 100 samples randomly selected from
OntoNotes for both ChatGPT and OnEFET.
This error usually results from the understanding of ontology struc-
tures, and mistakenly predicts the wrong fine-grained type for an
entity. Type III: Nested entity spans. Model sometimes assigns
mistakenly the types of the entire entity to that of its nested entity.
Type IV: Out-of-vocabulary type prediction. This type of error
happens with ChatGPT, where it generates an out-of-vocabulary
entity type even provided with the given ontology structure.
Compared with ChatGPT, OnEFET dramatically reduces the er-
ror of incorrect fine-grained inferences, which could be attributed
to the coarse-to-fine typing algorithm, and the enrichment of types
that help to distinguish the fine-grained semantics. We also ob-
served that even though ChatGPT is loaded with much more com-
prehensive knowledge bases, OnEFET still wins a little in terms of
Type I andType III. While direct inference with knowledge bases
helps to reduce these two types, OnEFET can delicately infer the
correct type with better interpretation of surrounding contexts.
5.4 Case Study
We further conduct a case study compared to some baseline models
for an intuitive view as shown in Figure 3. Since ZOE performs the
best as to the accuracy in the FIGER dataset, here we randomly
grabbed several samples and compare the results generated by
OnEFET, ZOE, and the ground truth on the FIGER dataset. We
observe that OnEFET performs better than ZOE on these samples.
Specifically, OnEFET well interprets the contextualized information.
Consider the first example, ZOE maps “Utah” directly to Wikipedia
entries, and obtains “location”, whereas in the specific context,
“Utah” actually means a sports team. For the second and the third

example, ZOE even cannot predict the correct coarse-grained type
name, and even give invalid answer. In the fourth example, OnEFET
takes advantage of the key phrase “Videowatercolors” and infers
that “Balth” here refers to a painter, which is even finer than the
ground truth annotation.
6 RELATED WORK
Fine-grained Entity Typing with Supervision. The goal of fine-
grained entity typing (FET) is to determine the type of entity given
a particular context and, optionally, a label hierarchy [ 22,50]. Pre-
vious studies typically use pre-defined ontology hierarchy and
co-occurrence structures estimated from data to enhance the mod-
els. To this end, [ 4,37,49] design new loss functions to exploit
label hierarchies in the ontology. [ 28,40] embed labels into a high-
dimension or a new space as representations. [ 23] explores label
dependencies and designs label reasoning mechanisms for effec-
tive decoding. There are also studies that exploit the co-occurrence
structures including enriching label representations by introduc-
ing associated labels [ 48], requiring latent label representation to
reconstruct the co-occurrence structure [ 21], or limiting the label
range for classification during prediction [ 35]. There are two prob-
lems for this research line. First, they neglect the very essential
problem inherent in the given ontology, and build blocks to fit in
with the potentially problematic structure, which may bring the
noise. Second, the experiments are all conducted with direct or
indirect supervision, which poses a great challenge and burden for
data annotation. To alleviate the data scarcity issue, the setting of
zero-shot fine-grained entity typing is introduced.
The most relevant work to us in this research line is LITE [ 20],
which makes use of the indirect supervision from NLI to infer type
information. However, LITE still requires supervision for training,
which is the first difference from our zero-shot setting. Also, it does
not consider the hierarchical structure of ontology as they perform
typing, which could limit the performance.
Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Entity Typing. Zero-shot fine-grained
entity Typing has been explored widely to alleviate the data scarcity
issue. Existing zero-shot FET frameworks infuse multiple sources ofinformation. [ 52] focuses on capturing the relationship between un-
seen and seen types in order to produce label representations for the
unseen types. [ 25] enhances label representations by incorporating
hierarchical and prototypical information derived from manually
selected context-free entities as prototypes. [ 51] maps mention em-
beddings to the type embedding space by training a neural model
to combine entity and context information. [29, 58] define unseen
types by generating type embeddings from Wikipedia descriptions.
[5] fuses three external knowledge, contextual, pre-defined hierar-
chy, and label descriptions. Then three independent modules are
trained for the knowledge, whose results are further combined to
get the final results. Nonetheless, these zero-shot learning algo-
rithms still require extensive annotations on the source domain or
manually selecting high-quality representative mentions.
In zero-shot settings, OntoType [ 18] stands out as the most
closely related work to ours, being an ontology-guided framework.
However, OntoType operates on a non-training approach with min-
imal interaction between the model and the task-specific ontology.
Consequently, it struggles with fine-grained type identification, and
its headword parsing often falls short in domain-specific tasks.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we study the problem of zero-shot fine-grained entity
typing (FET) via our designed framework OnEFET which lever-
ages the automatically enriched instances and topic information
of ontology. We first generate pseudo-training data with instances
with reward mechanisms to encourage diversity in the generation.
Then we incorporate topic information in self-attention to better
align contextualized information. We also use the generalized cross-
entropy loss to allow noise in the generated training sentences.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms previous zero-shot baselines. Additionally, we
also apply OnEFET to unseen and even fine-grained entity types
to verify the transferability. For future work, it is of interest to
incorporate linguistic clues and contextual information into the
hypothesize of NLI models, and to employ a label-binding cross-
encoder framework [32] for inference speedup.

A EVALUATION METRICS
Following [ 22], we evaluate our framework and compare it with
baseline models using three metrics: Strict Accuracy (Acc), Micro-
F1 (Mi-F1), and Macro-F1 (Ma-F1). Given a set of entity mentions𝑀, ground truths and predicted types are denoted as 𝑡𝑀and ˜𝑡𝑀
respectively. We have the following metrics:
Strict Accuracy. The prediction is considered correct if and only
if𝑡𝑀=˜𝑡𝑀.

Macro-F1. Macro-F1 is calculated using Macro-Precision ( 𝑃Ma)
and Macro-Recall ( 𝑅Ma) where
