ABSTRACT
Classification tasks in many real-world domains are exacerbated
by class imbalance, relatively small sample sizes compared to high
dimensionality, and measurement uncertainty. The problem of class
imbalance has been extensively studied, and data augmentation
methods based on interpolation of minority class instances have
been proposed as a viable solution to mitigate imbalance. It remains
to be seen whether augmentation can be applied to improve the
overall performance while maintaining stability, especially with
a limited number of samples. In this paper, we present a novel
feature-space augmentation technique that can be applied to high-
dimensional data for classification tasks and address these issues.
Our method utilizes uniform random sampling and introduces syn-
thetic instances by taking advantage of the local distributions of
individual features in the observed instances. The core augmenta-
tion algorithm is class-invariant, which opens up an unexplored
avenue of simultaneously improving and stabilizing performance by
augmenting unlabeled instances. The proposed method is evaluated
using a comprehensive performance analysis involving multiple
classifiers and metrics. Comparative analysis with existing feature
space augmentation methods strongly suggests that the proposed
algorithm can result in improved classification performance while
also increasing the overall reliability of the performance evaluation.

1 INTRODUCTION
Classification algorithms that work well in theoretical settings
can falter in the face of peculiarities often observed in real-world
datasets. Many such issues stem from small sample sizes, whether
it is the total number of samples available relative to the high
dimensionality or complexity of the decision function needed, or
the skewed distribution of sample sizes of different classes. In the
presence of these issues, accurate estimation of class boundaries
can be affected unduly by the majority-class instances, uncertainty
in feature values, outlier instances, or simply the lack of instances
to learn complex classification models.
A commonly encountered problem is class imbalance, a phe-
nomenon where one or more classes have a relatively low number
of instances compared to the others. Imbalance affects the classi-
fication accuracy of the minority class and presents a significant
hurdle in classification tasks [ 15,16,18]. The problem of class im-
balance is well-studied, with many different solutions proposed
and evaluated. Resampling, whether random or targeted, has been
investigated as a potential remedy for imbalance [ 19,21,22,30].
Class rebalancing using random under/oversampling is, however,
akin to assigning weights to individual instances and has limited
benefits. A more sophisticated approach is augmentation, which
can be used to artificially inflate the number of instances in a dataset.
One or more realinstances are used to generate additional synthetic
instances that typically inherit the class label of their respective
parents. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a
popular augmentation method that generates synthetic instances
along the lines joining the 𝑘-nearest neighbors of real instances
[4]. The success of SMOTE has inspired a plethora of synthetic
data generation techniques operating in feature space [ 2,3,5,6,8–
11,13,14,24,26,28,29], all of which employ some form of instance
interpolation. SMOTE and its variations are primarily designed
to address imbalance, and in most practical scenarios, synthetic
instances are generated for the minority classes only.
Deep neural networks designed for image and speech classifi-
cation problems have taken an altogether different approach to
augmentation. As model complexity grows, so does the need for
additional training data, even when curated datasets contain mil-
lions of training examples with balanced classes. Augmentation
methods intuitively defined as composite transformations are there-
fore leveraged to grow the number of instances per class. As an
example, color distortions, rotations, and mirroring can be applied

to an image to produce a synthetic image that preserves the char-
acteristics and class label of the parent while introducing varia-
tion. Modality-specific transformations can therefore be tailored
to inflate the entire training data, not just the minority class sam-
ples, which can in turn significantly improve performance across
the board [ 1,7,17]. Unfortunately, transformations that are in-
tuitively defined for images and text do not generalize to many
high-dimensional, human-imperceptible data modalities. Sampling
and interpolation-based techniques such as SMOTE can be applied
to these domains, albeit they have not been demonstrated to be
successful beyond the scope of imbalanced datasets.
Learning from small sample sizes can be challenging in gen-
eral, both in the context of training sufficiently complex yet stable
models to properly fit the data, and providing robust and reliable
performance evaluation to select the best model for deployment and
estimate true performance in the field [ 27]. Furthermore, real-world
data often contains noisy features due to measurement uncertainty
[23]. Popular strategies to improve classification performance on
high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes, such as margin
maximization, feature selection, and sparsity-based regularization,
can be sensitive to outliers and measurement uncertainty, as indi-
vidual instances contribute heavily towards the outcome. Currently
available feature-space augmentation methods do not handle this
problem properly, since synthetic instances are sampled from class-
specific distributions, while in general the measurement uncertainty
is expected to be class-invariant (e.g., fluctuations of body weight
measured using a scale should be independent of a subject’s gender).
Given the small number of samples, the performance evaluation can
suffer from a lack of confidence as high variance may be observed
regardless of the choice of the performance metric. We hypothe-
size that feature-space augmentation can be harnessed to improve
classification performance on small sample sizes and potentially
noisy features, for which the challenge exists both in learning ro-
bust classification models and in conducting reliable performance
evaluations.
In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for numeric data
augmentation in feature space by disregarding the class labels and
focusing on the distribution of individual features. We demonstrate
that this class-invariant algorithm can be effective in resolving
several commonly encountered problems in classification tasks,
including class imbalance and small sample sizes. We show that
our method outperforms existing augmentation tools for multiple
classifiers trained on a wide range of datasets with both balanced
and imbalanced classes.
2 METHODOLOGY
2.1 Rationale of the Proposed Method
We propose a novel augmentation method in feature space, Class-
invariant Feature Range Uniform Sampling (CiFRUS), to address
common challenges in real-world classification problems such as
class imbalance, small sample size, high dimensionality, and fea-
ture uncertainty. Our method introduces synthetic data points by
generating feature values that are randomly drawn from a locally
approximated distribution of feature values in the real data. The
result is that each real instance is expanded into a collection of

in feature space, which results in a more refined and stable
classification boundary.
instances forming a point cloud in feature space, where the expan-
sion in each dimension is determined by the probability density
near the real parent instance (Figure 1). A key difference between
our method and the existing augmentation methods is that our
synthesis process relies on the distribution of individual features
from the entire dataset, disregarding the class labels. This approach
stands in stark contrast to the instance-level, intra-class interpola-
tion adopted by SMOTE and its many successors.
There are several important consequences of this seemingly
small difference. First of all, our method significantly constricts the
inter-class regions, which can be useful for improving classifica-
tion performance on both class-balanced and imbalanced datasets.
Synthetic instances introduced by currently available methods are
confined in the convex hull of the observed instances for each class
and therefore contribute little to refining the decision boundaries
already defined by the observed instances. With our method, syn-
thetic instances are more likely to expand into the gap between
different classes, which helps to learn more complex classifiers.
This is especially important for high-dimensional datasets with rel-
atively few samples. In such cases, simpler models such as logistic
regression or small decision trees / tree-ensembles are generally
preferred to avoid overfitting, but these simple models may fail to
capture the real relationship in the data, limiting the prediction
performance. Our method constricts the region in feature space
where a decision boundary can be established, which in turn can
force the approximated non-linear decision boundaries to curve
around the point clouds and result in an overall more complex but
stable classifier without increasing the risk of overfitting.
Secondly, as our augmentation method takes into account fea-
ture values from all classes, it can be intuitively interpreted as
emulating measurement uncertainty. SMOTE and its variants em-
ploy intra-class interpolation, which in practice, only applies to the
minority class. Even if interpolation is applied to non-minority class

instances, the generation process is determined entirely by class-
specific densities. Measurement uncertainty, on the other hand,
is not unique to individual classes. In our method, the synthetic
data instances and their associated real parents represent an en-
semble of points for each real one. The cloud of synthetic points
associated with each real point signifies variations of that point
that can arise from measurement uncertainty. As a result, both
the model-building and evaluation processes are forced to take
into consideration sample variations, thus reducing the impact of
measurement uncertainty.
Lastly, while the synthetic data points generated in our method
can inherit the class label of their respective parent, the labels of the
parent data points are allowed to be unknown. This makes our aug-
mentation method versatile for different purposes. Synthetic data
points can be added to the training set for building more complex
models, and to the testing set (with labels hidden) or prediction set
(with unknown labels) for more robust predictions as well as more
reliable performance evaluation results. The latter is especially im-
portant for small or imbalanced datasets, where robust methods for
performance evaluation are lacking.
2.2 Uniform Sampling from Feature Range
We now outline the procedure to produce a synthetic instance
from a given query instance by leveraging an observed training
dataset of real instances. The training data is fitted by independently
sorting each feature vector and storing them, with the class labels
disregarded. To augment a query instance, the insertion locations of
its feature values into the corresponding sorted feature vectors are
determined. A high and low feature value proximal to the insertion
location is then chosen for setting the upper and lower bounds
for uniform sampling of a synthetic feature value. Let, 𝑋∈R𝑛×𝑚
denote the training dataset with 𝑛instances and 𝑚features. Let, 𝐹=
{𝑥1,𝑥2,...,𝑥 𝑛}⊤denote the column vector for a particular feature in
𝑋. Sorting𝐹yields ˆ𝐹={ˆ𝑥1,ˆ𝑥2,...,ˆ𝑥𝑛}⊤such that ˆ𝑥1≤ˆ𝑥2≤...≤
ˆ𝑥𝑛. For a query instance with corresponding feature value 𝑞, we
find its insertion location 𝑖into ˆ𝐹such that∀𝑗(𝑗<𝑖⇒ˆ𝑥𝑗<𝑞)
and∀𝑗(𝑗≥𝑖⇒ˆ𝑥𝑗≥𝑞). Using𝑖as the midpoint, we acquire two
proximal indices:
𝑙=max(1,𝑖−𝑘) (1)
𝑢=min(𝑛,𝑖+𝑘−1) (2)
Here,𝑙and𝑢are the indices of ˆ𝐹containing the bounds for
random sampling. These bounds are denoted as 𝑏𝑙=ˆ𝑥𝑙and𝑏𝑢=
ˆ𝑥𝑢. The feature value for a new synthetic instance is drawn from
a uniform random distribution with lower bound 𝑏𝑙and upper
bound𝑏𝑢. The parameter 𝑘controls the width of the local sampling
range in feature space. Using this approach, the synthetic feature
value is bounded by [ˆ𝑥1,ˆ𝑥𝑛). However, in the event of an outlier
query feature value that falls outside of these bounds, the generated
values may not accurately represent the query sample. In this case,
the bounds of the uniform distribution are expanded as follows:
𝑏𝑙=min(ˆ𝑥𝑙,𝑞)and𝑏𝑢=max(ˆ𝑥𝑢,𝑞). This process is independent
for each feature and can be generalized to any number of features.
Algorithm 1 implements this synthesis procedure. Using feature
space sampling, the algorithm generates 𝑟synthetic instances for
every instance in a set of query instances. The parameter 𝑟is theAlgorithm 1: CiFRUS-Resample(𝑋,𝑄,𝑟,𝑘)

synthesis rate. Unlike other feature-space augmentation methods
such as SMOTE and ADASYN, the class label is not factored into
the augmentation algorithm. Therefore, our algorithm can augment
instances from the training dataset, as well as unlabeled instances
using the distribution of the training set. When training instances
with known class labels are augmented, every synthetic instance
is assigned the same class labels as the real parent instance. When
instances with hidden or unknown labels are augmented, the class
label assignment step is skipped. Figure 2 demonstrates a run of the
algorithm with 𝑘=2,𝑟=3for a single query instance and a training
dataset with 5 instances and 4 features. The time complexity of this
algorithm is discussed in Appendix A.

observed samples. The query sample and training dataset have 4 features each. If the class label of the query sample is known,
then it is inherited by the synthetic samples.
2.3 Class-specific Synthesis Rates
The generation of synthetic instances using our method does not
rely on the class label of their parent instances. However, in the case
of augmenting instances from the training set, the class labels are
known. It is therefore possible to apply a different synthesis rate to
each class of instances. The set of unique class labels is denoted as 𝐶,
and𝑦={𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑛}∈𝐶𝑛×1indicates the class label of the instances
in𝑋. We appended a subscript 𝑐to the synthesis rate parameter 𝑟
such that𝑟𝑐represents the synthesis rate for instances that belong
to class𝑐. Algorithm 2 implements class-specific synthesis rates and
acts as a wrapper for Algorithm 1. While this algorithm requires
the user to specify the synthesis rate for each class, it can be utilized
to perform class balancing, which is discussed in the next section.
2.4 Balanced Augmentation of Labeled Data
The class-imbalance problem can be solved using our algorithm
by applying a different synthesis rate to each class such that the
imbalance is minimized or eliminated after augmentation. If the
synthesis rate for either the majority or the minority class is fixed,
then the required rate to balance the other classes can be determined
with ease. In our implementation, we parameterize the synthesis
rate for the majority class and dynamically determine the synthesis
rates for other classes such that the total number of instances in
non-majority classes after augmentation is at least equal to that of
the majority. As an example, let us consider a two-class dataset with
23 and 7 instances for the classes. We revert to a scalar synthesis
rate parameter 𝑟, which will only apply to the majority class. In
practice, augmented data includes both synthesized and their parent
real instances. If 𝑟=5, then the total number of instances for the
majority class after augmentation is 23×(𝑟+1)=138. To exceed
138 total instances, the synthesis rate for the minority class should
be⌈(138−7)/7⌉=19. After augmentation, the minority class will
therefore have a total of 7×(1+19)=140instances. Generally,
let𝑛majdenote the number of instances in the majority class. For
any class𝑐with𝑛𝑐instances before augmentation, the synthesis
rate can be determined as ⌈𝑛maj(𝑟+1)/𝑛𝑐−1⌉. This scheme offers
control over the total number of samples post-augmentation while
achieving coarse-grained class balancing for any number of classes.
The determination of synthesis rates for non-majority classes canbe prefixed to Algorithm 2 to acquire a balancing variant of our
augmentation method.
2.5 Ensemble Classification of Augmented
Unlabeled Data
Feature-space augmentation methods typically require knowledge
of the class labels to augment the data. Since our proposed algo-
rithm does not require class labels to be known for fixed synthesis
rate augmentation, it is possible to augment instances whose labels
are unknown or hidden. The advantage of doing so is that an indi-
vidual real instance from the test set can be augmented into a point
cloud of instances, 𝑆, followed by ensemble classification. Each of
the instances in 𝑆can be classified in isolation, and the predicted
class label of the parent instance can be determined based on the
aggregation of predictions for all instances in 𝑆. As we will observe
later, augmentation of unlabeled instances before classification can
greatly benefit classification performance.
3 EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate our proposed method and compare the classification
performance with existing methods using a multi-faceted experi-
mental setup.
Datasets: 62 benchmarking datasets for binary classification avail-
able in the UCI Machine Learning repository, Kaggle, and [ 12] were
used. The datasets contain between 72 and 38,501 observations
and between 3 and 1,522 features (Figure 3). The class imbalance
also varies widely. The mammography dataset has an imbalance
ratio of 42.01, with only 2.32% of the instances belonging to the
minority class. In contrast, several datasets such as hill-valley and
seed contain an approximately even split of the two classes.
Classifiers: State-of-the-art classifiers were trained on the baseline
as well as augmented train splits of each dataset. Random Forest
(RF), Decision Tree (DT), 𝑘-nearest-neighbor (KNN), ADABOOST
(ADB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR) and
Gaussian Naive-Bayes (GNB) classifiers were trained using default
parameter settings from scikit-learn [25].
Augmentation: We evaluate three different variants of the CiFRUS
augmentation technique (Figure 4). Each dataset is split into train
andtestsets. The testset’s class labels or feature distributions are

All three CiFRUS variants see and augment the train set. The clas-
sifiers are trained on the augmented train sets. The first variant,
CiFRUS (train), implements the basic augmentation process de-
scribed in section 2.2, with a fixed synthesis rate of 𝑟=10. CiFRUS
(train/test) extends the first variant by augmenting testinstances
without seeing their class labels, using the feature distributions
oftrain (section 2.5). Each individual testinstance is augmented
into a set of instances, whose class probability scores are predicted
by the classifier. The label for the parent testinstance is then pre-
dicted using the average probability score. The testinstances are
augmented using the same synthesis rate of 10. The third variant,
CiFRUS (balanced-train/test) extends CiFRUS (train/test) by per-
forming class balancing while augmenting the train splits. With
this variant, the synthesis rate for the majority class is set to 5,
and the rate for the other class is determined dynamically (section
2.4). When augmenting testinstances, the synthesis rate can not be
dynamically determined as the class label is not known. Therefore,
thetestinstances are augmented with a fixed synthesis rate of 10.
In all three variations, the value of the sampling range parameter 𝑘
is calculated as a heuristic function of the number of instances in
thetrain set, such that 𝑘=min(√𝑛,20).
We also augmented the train sets using Random Oversampling
(ROS), Undersampling (RUS), SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE [ 13],

pair, augmentation methods were ranked based on the performance
metric averaged over 10 repeats of cross-validation. The overall
rank of each augmentation method for a specific classifier was
determined by taking the geometric mean of the ranks across all
62 datasets. All randomized algorithms were seeded with a global
constant to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
4 RESULTS
4.1 CiFRUS Outperforms Other Augmentation
Methods
The second and third CiFRUS variants, with their ability to augment
both labeled and unlabeled instances, have the top average AUC
rank for classifiers KNN, MLP, DT, ADB, and RF, outranking other
augmentation methods as well as the baseline dataset variants (Ta-
ble 1). This trend is consistent for other performance metrics such as
the Kappa statistic and F1-score (Appendix B, Table 3). In addition
to the overall rank, we counted the number of datasets for which
each augmentation method exhibited the highest performance met-
ric value. Using the Decision Tree classifier, CiFRUS (train/test)
augmentation produced the highest AUC in 22 out of 62 datasets,

and CiFRUS (balanced-train/test) produced the highest AUC for 33
(Figure 5). The three CiFRUS variants also produced the highest
AUC for 7, 16, and 17 datasets, respectively, using the Random For-
est classifier. Overall, the highest AUC for any CiFRUS variant was
no less than the highest AUC for any other augmentation tool in
over half of the datasets across all compared classifiers (62, 52, and
47 datasets for DT, ADB, and RF, respectively). Compared to when
trained on the baseline datasets, the classifiers KNN, MLP, DT, ADB,
and RF trained on CiFRUS-augmented datasets match or exceed the
performance for 35, 36, 52, 47, and 36 datasets, respectively. CiFRUS
variants also outperform other augmentation methods in terms of
the number of datasets for metrics such as the F1-score and Kappa
statistic (Appendix B, Figure 9). While CiFRUS showed promising
results when paired with a majority of the classifiers, tree-based
classifiers exhibited the greatest improvement. These classifiers
have non-linear decision boundaries and benefit the most from our
data augmentation method which generates synthetic data points
surrounding each real point, effectively forcing the classification
algorithm to produce more refined decision boundaries far away
from the real data points. LR and GNB are less likely to benefit
from it, as the augmented data points have less impact on the lin-
ear decision boundary and the probability distribution of feature
values.
To investigate whether CiFRUS can improve the performance
beyond what is attainable by classifiers sans augmentation, we
focus on Random Forest, one of the best-performing classifiers
across our benchmark suite. RF trained on baseline datasets has the
lowest average AUC rank of 6.6 among all classifier-augmentation
pairs excluding ours (data not shown). This suggests that improv-
ing the performance of vanilla RF is a more challenging task than
for other classifiers. The performance difference of Random For-
est between CiFRUS (balanced-train/test) augmentation and the
baseline is positive for most datasets, as evidenced by the distri-
butions of the metric differences (Figure 6). Paired t-tests between

the metric scores (e.g. AUC) for CiFRUS-augmented and baseline
datasets suggest that the observed performance improvement is
statistically significant (p-value ≤0.05) for all metrics except AUC,
for which the p-value is 0.058. The performance differences are also
mostly positive for DT, ADB, and KNN, two of which are tree-based
classifiers. This strongly suggests that CiFRUS can be employed to
improve classification performance across the board.
4.2 Improved Classification Performance on
Imbalanced or Sample-Scarce Datasets
Augmentation with CiFRUS can counter two of the most com-
mon problems encountered in the classification of many real-world
datasets: class imbalance, and a small number of observed instances
compared to a large number of feature variables. We refer to datasets
that exhibit these problems as imbalanced andsample-scarce, re-
spectively. Specifically, we consider datasets in our benchmark suite
with no more than 25% of all instances belonging to the minority
class (imbalance ratio ≥3) as imbalanced, whereas datasets con-
taining fewer minority class instances than twice the number of
features (𝑛minority <2𝑚) are considered sample-scarce. Using these
specifications, 12 of the 62 datasets are imbalanced, 12 are sample-
scarce, and 5 fall into both groups. The difference between with-
and without-augmentation performance of the classifiers is used to
measure the effectiveness of each augmentation tool in mitigating
class imbalance and sample scarcity. To minimize the effect of sto-
chastic factors, we only consider datasets for which the absolute
metric difference exceeds a threshold value of 0.005. Figure 7 shows
the number of imbalanced and sample-scarce datasets for which
performance improves or worsens by at least the threshold amount.
The second and third variants of the CiFRUS algorithm improvethe AUC by at least 0.005 for more datasets than any other aug-
mentation method. This observation holds for all classifiers used
in the benchmarking. Interestingly, this includes the GNB and LR
classifiers, where our method results in improved AUC when only
imbalanced and sample-scarce datasets are considered. As for the
Kappa statistic, a majority of the augmentation methods, including
ours, perform poorly with the GNB and LR classifiers. Nonetheless,
our method is among the most successful in terms of raising the
Kappa statistic as well as the F1-score and MCC for KNN, DT, ADB,
and RF. These results suggest that CiFRUS is particularly useful
when dealing with class imbalance and sample scarcity, and can be
a reliable tool to improve the performance of datasets that exhibit
these challenges.
4.3 CiFRUS Increases Reliability of
Performance Evaluation
One of the most critical aspects of classification tasks is the evalua-
tion of classifiers and associated configurations that best fit a partic-
ular domain. Performance evaluation is typically conducted using
cross-validation followed by the computation of a performance
metric such as AUC, which is used to select the best classifier. In
the case of datasets with very few samples, the evaluation itself can
be unreliable. Reliability can be measured by computing variability
or confidence intervals of AUC for different folds or repeats. We
claim that compared to other augmentation algorithms, CiFRUS
augmentation can increase reliability while retaining or improving
the average value of the performance metric. To inspect the impact
of augmentation on both classifier performance and evaluation reli-
ability, we calculated the variance and average of each performance
metric over 10 repeats of stratified cross-validation for every dataset.
Each augmentation method was assigned two separate ranks, one

based on the average and the other based on the variance of the per-
formance metrics. Smaller rank values indicate larger averages and
smaller variances. Figure 8 shows the overall ranks of each augmen-
tation method using the RF, LR, and ADB classifiers, calculated over
all datasets as well as imbalanced and sample-scarce datasets only.
In the case of RF, the second and third CiFRUS variants both rank
favorably, with the third variant outperforming most of the other
augmentation methods in addition to the baseline on improving the
metric average and minimizing variance. The same two variants
rank exceptionally well with the ADB classifier across all metrics.
As for LR, while the average and variance ranks for all datasets
are not significantly better, CiFRUS outperforms others in terms of
the variance rank for imbalanced and sample-scarce datasets. For
datasets with these characteristics, other augmentation methods,
paired with most of the classifiers, rank poorly in terms of the vari-
ance in F1-score, Kappa, and balanced accuracy, with G-SMOTE
being the only exception. In contrast, CiFRUS variants consistently
achieve greater performance and generally small variances when
imbalanced and sample-scarce datasets are considered, suggesting
that they excel in simultaneously improving performance and in-
creasing confidence in the reliability of classifier evaluation. Wealso ranked the augmentation methods after pairing them with
GNB, KNN, MLP, and DT (Appendix B, Figure 10). While some of
these classifiers favor the baseline, the performance of CiFRUS is
generally on par with the other augmentation methods when all
datasets are considered. In the case of imbalanced and sample-scarce
datasets, CiFRUS is ranked higher than other methods in terms of
performance average and does moderately well in variance.
It is interesting to note that only the last two variants of CiFRUS
achieve high performance and reliability when paired with most of
the classifiers. The most likely explanation points to their ability to
augment unlabeled test data. The decision boundary drawn by a
classifier may not be necessarily accurate for individual instances
that fall close to the boundary, resulting in misclassification. How-
ever, when a test point instance is expanded into a cloud of points
through augmentation, the predicted class label is determined by
the classification of all points in that cloud. If the classifier correctly
predicts the class label for the majority of the synthetic points, then
the misclassification of the parent instance is corrected through
wisdom of crowds, which best explains the superior performance of
the train/test and balanced-train/test CiFRUS variants.

Figure 8: Augmentation methods ranked by average and variance of each performance metric using Random Forest (top row),
Logistic Regression (middle row), and AdaBoost (bottom row). Each augmentation method was ranked on metric average as
well as variance over 10 repeats of stratified cross-validation. The overall rank is determined using the geometric mean of
ranks from individual datasets. Smaller ranks correspond to high average and low variance.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a numeric data augmentation algorithm
to address common issues in constructing and evaluating classi-
fication models on data with class imbalance and small sample
sizes. The novelty of our method lies in taking advantage of the
distributions of the individual features while ignoring the class
labels. Compared to previous work in this field which is mostly
directed toward resolving class imbalance, we demonstrate that our
method can improve performance across the board and works just
as well for datasets with imbalance and small sample sizes. Our
method can also be used to increase the reliability of performance
evaluation. Although this approach can be readily applied to multi-
classification problems, further experiments can be conducted to
determine its effectiveness in tackling more complex classification
tasks.

A TIME COMPLEXITY
The running time of CiFRUS is compared with Random Sampling
and SMOTE in Table 2. It should be noted that 𝑟≤𝑛in most practi-
cal scenarios. Random Sampling is faster than ours by a 𝑂(log𝑛)
factor, and CiFRUS has a more favorable runtime than SMOTE for
a typical synthesis rate 𝑟≤𝑛
log𝑛.
Table 2: Time complexity comparison
Fit Augment Combined
Sampling 𝑂(1)𝑂(𝑚𝑛𝑟)𝑂(𝑚𝑛𝑟)
SMOTE 𝑂(𝑚𝑛2)𝑂(𝑚𝑛𝑟) (𝑚𝑛2)
CiFRUS 𝑂(𝑚𝑛log𝑛)𝑂(𝑚𝑛𝑟 log𝑛)𝑂(𝑚𝑛𝑟 log𝑛)
It is important to consider that SMOTE and Random Sampling al-
gorithms have an altogether narrow scope of application compared
to our method. In these algorithms, the fitandaugment operations
are implemented jointly and expected to execute exactly once per
dataset. The effective runtime of fit-augment in SMOTE algorithms
is𝑂(𝑚𝑛2)when𝑟is constant and 𝑛denotes the number of minority
instances. SMOTE and Random Sampling are also only applicable
to labeled data, whereas the augment operation of CiFRUS can be
executed as many times as needed for augmenting new batches of
unlabeled data. Furthermore, the initial execution of fit-augment
can be optimized to run in 𝑂(𝑚𝑛log𝑛)time for constant 𝑟by ex-
ploiting the fact that the feature value insertion locations in the
train set are known at the time of sorting.
B SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS
Table 3 shows the overall ranks of the augmentation methods calcu-
lated for the F1-score, Kappa, MCC, and balanced-accuracy. Smaller
ranks correspond to high values of the performance metrics. For
each performance metric, the top-ranked method in each column
is marked with an asterisk. CiFRUS variants that outrank other
methods and the baseline (no augmentation) are highlighted in
blue. CiFRUS variants consistently outrank under/over-sampling,
SMOTE, and its successors, as well as the baseline for most classi-
fiers in the benchmark except GNB and LR.
Figure 9 shows the number of datasets for which each augmenta-
tion tools produce the highest cross-validation metric score. Figure
10 presents the average and variance rank of each augmentation
method for the classifiers GNB, KNN, MLP, and DT.
