Abstract
Predicting information diffusion is a fundamental task in online
social networks (OSNs). Recent studies mainly focus on the pop-
ularity prediction of specific content but ignore the correlation
between multiple pieces of information. The topic is often used to
correlate such information and can correspond to multi-source in-
formation. The popularity of a topic relies not only on information
diffusion time but also on users’ followership. Current solutions
concentrate on hard time partition, lacking versatility. Meanwhile,
the hop-based sampling adopted in state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
encounters redundant user followership. Moreover, many SOTA
methods are not designed with good modularity and lack evalua-
tion for each functional module and enlightening discussion. This
paper presents a novel extensible framework, coined as HIF, for
effective popularity prediction in OSNs with four original contribu-
tions. First, HIF adopts a soft partition of users and time intervals
to better learn users’ behavioral preferences over time. Second,
HIF utilizes weighted sampling to optimize the construction of
heterogeneous graphs and reduce redundancy. Furthermore, HIF
supports multi-task collaborative optimization to improve its learn-
ing capability. Finally, as an extensible framework, HIF provides
generic module slots to combine different submodules (e.g., RNNs,

1 Introduction
Users often post content regarding their life and work in online
social networks (OSNs). After a user posts content, some other
users see and repost the content through platform recommendation
or their followership, arousing information diffusion. Information
diffuses among users in a cascading manner, called information
cascade, and its diffusion topological structure forms a directed
acyclic graph (DAG), called cascade graph, as the observed cascade
shown in Figure 1, where the original post is the source information
and the user sending it is the source user. Users may also mark their
post content with topic tags (i.e., hashtags), and the topic is a macro
form of information. There might be more than one source under
the same topic, i.e., the multi-source information. Posts without
topic tags can be simply treated as single-source information.

Figure 1: A multi-source cascade graph. 𝑢0,𝑢1/𝑢2-𝑢5are
source / reposted users, the others are un-reposted users and
some of them (e.g., 𝑢9,𝑢10) may repost in the future.
In this work, we take the number of users (e.g., users from 𝑢0to
𝑢10in Figure 1) involved in information diffusion to quantify the
popularity, which also measures how influential and widespread the
information is. Popularity prediction has been widely studied as a
fundamental task that can be applied to broad real-world scenarios,
such as online advertisement [ 11], social recommendation [ 30],
rumor detection [3], epidemiology [42], etc.
We categorize recent works into the following taxonomies: Dif-
fusion pattern-based models such as the independent cascade
(IC) model and the linear threshold (LT) model (e.g., [ 22,31]),
estimate the diffusion result with the help of Monte Carlo Sim-
ulation; Feature-based approaches feed hand-crafted spatial-
temporal features (e.g., [ 8]), user features (e.g., [ 1]), and content
features (e.g., [ 45]) into machine learning models to make predic-
tions; Generation-based approaches suppose that the informa-
tion diffusion can be characterized by a generative probabilistic
model (e.g., [ 25]);Deep learning-based approaches are mainly
based on RNNs (e.g., [ 30]) and homogeneous/heterogeneous GNNs
(e.g, [ 3,6]) to automatically learn the cascades’ spatial-temporal fea-
tures. Though there have been many related efforts in recent years,
we have noticed that most of them are based on less-expressive
data structures, such as sequence or homogeneous graph. This is
especially true for works proposed in the early stage, and only a few
recent works [ 36,38] have begun to take advantage of the better
expressive capacity of heterogeneous graphs. Currently, existing
works still suffer from the following common challenges:
Hard time partition: An information cascade with length |𝑐|
can generate|𝑇𝐸|time interval(s) to learn temporal features, and
there are three mainstream partition and processing granularities:
1) Fine-grained methods (e.g., [ 5,7]) map each (re)posted user
on the cascade to a unique time interval, i.e., |𝑐|=|𝑇𝐸|, and then
process them (e.g. feeding into RNN) separately, which is tricky on
sequence’s unequal length when using mini-batch training, and is
easy to suffer from bottlenecks if the cascade sequence is too long;
2) coarse-grained methods (e.g., [ 6,38]) treat all timestamps as
one or even ignore temporal features, i.e., |𝑐|≤1, which may be
efficient but is hard to take full advantage of temporal features;
3) middle-grained methods (e.g., [36]) make a good trade-off on
efficiency and learning ability, where the timeline is partitioned
into several equal time intervals, i.e., 1<|𝑐|<|𝑇𝐸|. For example,
there are only 5time intervals in Figure 1, so that temporal features
can be captured without incurring more efficiency concerns.
The middle-grained partition simply maps users into different
individual intervals, neglecting whether the partition is reasonable.For example, consider a scene where a piece of information is
originally posted at 23:25 and the 1hour observation window is
partitioned into 6time intervals (i.e., 23:25-23:34, 23:35-23:44, ...,
00:15-00:24), and a user is used to browse social networks for 15
minutes before sleep at 23:40, and this user reposts the information
at 23:35. In the case of hard-time partition, the user is mapped
to the second interval, but actually, the first interval is covered
by the users’ behavior preferences, and the second is only half
overlapped, indicating that the first interval represents the user
behavior preferences better than the second interval. It would be
great if the different matching degrees of these two intervals could
be considered at one time.
Redundant followership network: The followership is neces-
sary for many social networks to construct a heterogeneous graph
based on a cascade graph, existing heterogeneous graph construc-
tion methods (e.g., [ 36]) mainly utilize the hop-based sampling. For
a sampled followership network with 𝑁𝑓total followers and 𝑁𝑝
potential followers ( 𝑁𝑝≪𝑁𝑓in most cases), we denote its redun-
dancy as𝑝𝑟=𝑁𝑝/𝑁𝑓. In practice, 𝑝𝑟’s value is usually very low,
e.g., as illustrated in our case study, the 𝑝𝑟of hop-based sampling
is0.059, demonstrating that there are only about 1/20of sampled
followers are beneficial.
Lacking of expansive discussion and enlightenment: Var-
ious approaches have been proposed in recent works, and each
of them has almost completely different strategies or components,
which contributes to the prosperity of popularity prediction re-
search. For example, HERI-GCN and CoupledGNN [ 6] employ dy-
namic features and hand-crafted features as initialization node
features, respectively. Upon reading these works, researchers might
be curious about the following questions: what motivated the au-
thors to select such distinct initialization strategies? How will it
perform if replaced with another strategy, and why? It is impera-
tive to discuss the above questions as the discussion can provide
valuable insights for future studies.
In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous GNN-driven
Information prediction Framework (HIF) to solve the above chal-
lenges. The major contributions of our work are summarized below:
Soft time partition: We inventively propose a more elastic time
interval partition method named Soft-Partition, which connects
users and time intervals by multiple links with learnable weights,
improving the flexibility, rationality, and accuracy of time partition.
Weighted dynamic sampling: We design weighted dynamic
sampling, which is a more efficient followership sampling method
than current hop-based sampling. Our sampling method samples
followers step by step. At each step, we select a batch of the most
meaningful followers via an elaborate weighted strategy until the
number of sampled followers reaches the threshold.
Collaborative optimization: We present the Timeline Error,
which constrains the variability and continuity of temporal embed-
ding. We minimize the Timeline Error as an additional optimization
task to collaboratively optimize temporal feature learning.
Extensive experiments and discussions: We evaluate HIF
via extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and present
comprehensive discussions. The results show excellent performance
and provide enlightening significance.

2 Related Work
We summarize recent research from the following four categories:
Diffusion pattern-based models: The famous models in this
category are the IC-based model [ 17,20,26,28,29,31] and the
LT-based model [ 17,20,22], and they both assume that a user will
be influenced to involve in the information diffusion process when
the predefined conditions are satisfied. Specifically, the IC-based
models assume that each user has a probability to be influenced
once at least one of his/her neighbors has been influenced, while
the LT-based models suppose that a user will be influenced once
the accumulated weights from his/her influenced neighbors reach
the threshold. Both IC-based models and LT-based models heavily
rely on predefined diffusion patterns (e.g., the conditions for users
to be influenced), which require prior knowledge and are easy to
get extremely complicated as pattern complexity increases. These
models also have defects in time handling, such as hardly simulating
users being influenced at different times and the time decay effect.
Feature-based approaches: The following hand-crafted fea-
tures were once widely used by feature-based approaches: content
features such as the TF-IDF and LDA [ 45];temporal features such
as the observation time and the time delta [ 8];spatial features such
as the page ranking [ 6,18], edge density [ 2,43];user features such
as the number of followers [ 1,16], profiles [ 39]; These approaches
heavily rely on the quality of features and lack generality across
different domains, such as academic networks.
Generation-based approaches: These approaches assume that
all data are "generated" by the underlying model, and the point pro-
cess is one of these models and is often used to model real-world phe-
nomena and user preferences. The most representative generation-
based approaches rely on the point process. DeepHawkes [ 5] is a
typical approach that employs the Hawkes point process to model
self-activation and time decay. Literature [ 25,33] model the influ-
ence diffusion via the Poison point process.
Deep learning-based approaches: Most approaches in this
category are designed in an end-to-end way, and they automati-
cally learn user embeddings or information embeddings. We further
categorize them into three groups: 1) RNN-based approaches : Deep-
Cas [ 19] is an end-to-end model that firstly leverages DeepWalk
[23] to sample paths from the cascade graph and feed them into a
Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) for prediction. Topo-
LSTM [ 34] adapts LSTM [ 14] cell to the topological structure by
pooling multiple inputs for each cell. TempCas [ 30] combines at-
tention mechanism with Path Sampling, RNNs, and CNNs to learn
spatial-temporal embeddings. TCAN [ 27] explicitly encodes the
linear, the nonlinear, and the periodic features of time, and uses
them as initial features of user nodes for cascade graph and cascade
sequence feature learning. Nowadays, it is still strenuous for RNN-
based approaches to handle graphs. 2) Homogeneous GNN-based
approaches : DeepInf [ 24] utilizes GNN and attention mechanism
to predict the center user through a sampled ego network. Cou-
pledGNN [ 6] combines two GNNs to learn the states of information
and user alternatively, reinforcing the importance of structure in
information diffusion. BiGCN [ 3] considers the bidirectional influ-
ence in OSNs and models it by means of a top-down GNN and a
bottom-up GNN. CasCN [ 7] conducts convolution on each cascadesnapshot and then learns temporal features by feeding the convo-
luted spatial features into an RNN. It is the first GNN-based model
incorporated with RNN to learn the temporal feature. CasFlow
[37] not only utilizes GNNs and RNNs to learn spatial-temporal
embeddings but also takes advantage of variational auto-encoders
(VAE) to model the uncertainty of information diffusion. 3) Het-
erogeneous GNN-based approaches : DyHGCN [ 38], and HERI-GCN
[36] firstly apply heterogeneous GNNs to learn cascade embeddings
to predict the next (re)post user and the popularity, respectively.
Specifically, DyHGCN simply treats the heterogeneous graph learn-
ing as multiple homogeneous graph learning and aggregates the
learned embeddings via a heuristic method; HERI-GCN designs a
heterogeneous convolution kernel and integrates RNNs into GNNs
to learn temporal embeddings.
In summary, the temporal and spatial features are both critical for
popularity prediction, but only a few works, including HERI-GCN,
CasFlow, and CasCN, have conducted preliminary exploration. In
addition, compared to single-source information, multi-source in-
formation diffusion is a more general way of information diffusion,
especially in social networks, which is rarely explored by current
works except HERI-GCN.
3 Preliminaries
In this section, we present the definitions of fundamental concepts
and formally define the popularity prediction problem.
We use𝑁𝑠𝑐to denote the number of source users in information
cascade𝑐. For multi-source cascades, we have 𝑁𝑠𝑐>1, e.g., there are
two source users ( 𝑢0and𝑢1) in Figure 1. A single-source cascade is
a special case of a multi-source cascade such that 𝑁𝑠𝑐=1.
Multi-source cascade is a general form of information diffusion.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the example cascade is a 2-source cascade
with two source users ( 𝑢0and𝑢1). A single-source cascade can be
considered a special case of a multi-source cascade. For each posted
information, we record the (re)post actions in a cascading format,
i.e., a sequence of triples.
Definition 1 (Information Cascade). Given an information 𝑐, the
cascade sequentially describes the information’s diffusion process.
We use𝑐directly to represent the message and its cascade, formu-
lated by𝑐=[(𝑢0,𝑣0,𝑡𝑠0),(𝑢1,𝑣1,𝑡𝑠1),...], where triple(𝑢𝑖,𝑣𝑖,𝑡𝑠𝑖)
indicates user 𝑣𝑖reposts from user 𝑢𝑖at timestamp 𝑡𝑠𝑖.
We connect all users involved in a cascade 𝑐in terms of the repost-
ing relationship and obtain the cascade graph 𝐺𝑟,𝑐=(𝑉𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟,𝐸𝑟,𝑐),
where𝑉𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 is the node set and 𝐸𝑟,𝑐is the edge set. Superscript 𝑟
indicates the cascade is formed by repost actions. In the cascade
shown in Figure 1, we have 𝑢0to𝑢5in𝑉𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 and four edges in 𝐸𝑟,𝑐.
Besides the reposting relationship, there are multiple relation-
ships between users. For example, followership is widely adopted
in many OSNs (e.g., Twitter, Sina Weibo), The followership net-
work is denoted by a directed graph 𝐺𝑓=(𝑉𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟,𝐸𝑓), where𝑉𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟
contains all users, and 𝐸𝑓is the set of all followership edges, and
we have𝑉𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟⊂𝑉𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟. Followership network provides a global
graph that connects all users. This work is based on the hetero-
geneous graph, and we adopt the conception of meta-edge and
heterogeneous graph in [36]:
3462KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Zhen Wu, Jingya Zhou, Jinghui Zhang, Ling Liu, & Chizhou Huang
Definition 2 (Meta-Edge). The meta-edge is a simplification of a
meta-path whose length is exactly 1, and it is denoted by a triple
containing both node types and edge type, i.e., (head node type, edge
type, tail node type), abbreviated as (𝑇𝑢,𝑇𝑒,𝑇𝑣).
Each meta-edge illustrates the topological relationship of the
same species by giving the types of both head/tail nodes and edge.
It is the abstraction of a kind of edge in the heterogeneous graph.
Definition 3 (Heterogeneous Graph). A heterogeneous graph is
denoted byG=(V,E), whereVis the collection of different types
of node sets andEis the edge set. For each meta-edge (𝑇𝑢,𝑇𝑒,𝑇𝑣)
ofG, we have𝑇𝑢,𝑇𝑣∈V and𝑇𝑒∈E. For example, for a graph
that contains repost edges and follow edges between users, it has
V={𝑉𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟}andE={𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡,𝐸𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤}, and its meta-edges are
(𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟,𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡,𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟)and(𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟,𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤,𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟).
Finally, we define the popularity prediction problem as follows:
Definition 4 (Popularity Prediction). For a certain observation
time windowT(e.g., 1hour), our target is to anticipate the final
popularity|𝑐|(the size of the cascade) through the cascade observed
duringT,𝑐T={(𝑢,𝑣,𝑡𝑠)|∀𝑡𝑠≤T} . For example, in Figure 1, we
observe the cascade in the light blue area, which contains 5users,
and the final popularity is 11, i.e., the total quantity of involved
users from𝑢0to𝑢10.
Our goal is to learn a mapping function Θthat maps the input
to a predicted value ˆ𝑦such that ˆ𝑦is as close as possible to the
ground-truth popularity 𝑦, i.e., minimize the metric M:

ΘM(ˆ𝑦,𝑦)=arg min

4 Proposed Framework
HIF consists of three phases: heterogeneous graph construction, het-
erogeneous GNN-driven inference, and optimization. The overview
of HIF is shown in Figure 2.
4.1 Heterogeneous Graph Construction
In this paper, we denote each type of heterogeneous edge in an
adjacent matrix form.
4.1.1 Meta-Edges Between Users. The meta-edge (user, repost, user)
means the users and edges in 𝐺𝑟,𝑐, i.e.,𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝑢,𝑣)=1if(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝑐,
otherwise,𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝑢,𝑣)=0.
The followership may contain the potential paths for informa-
tion diffusion [ 36]. We use meta-edge (user, follow, user) to repre-
sent these relationships. For each cascade 𝑐, instead of using the
global followership network 𝐺𝑓, which is liable to lead to mas-
sive computation, we sample a subgraph whose edge set is 𝐸𝑓,𝑐
selected from 𝐺𝑓. The meta-edge (user, follow, user) is formulated
as:𝐸𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤(𝑢,𝑣)=1if(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸𝑓,𝑐, otherwise, 𝐸𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤(𝑢,𝑣)=0.
The sampling method used in [ 36] is hop-based, i.e., sampling
𝐻-hop followerships for all users in a cascade where 𝐻is a hyperpa-
rameter. However, this sampling method suffers from the efficiency
problem as mentioned in Sec. 1, and more details are discussed in
Sec. 5.
In this paper, we propose a new method to efficiently sample
more potential followers, i.e., Dynamic Weighted Sampling. Notethat nodes in different positions in 𝐺𝑟,𝑐may have different contri-
butions to information diffusion:
•The source nodes have only outgoing edges (no incoming edges)
and act as the most influential nodes that contribute most to the
diffusion of information in the future;
•The leaf nodes have only incoming edges and are no longer
reposted in observation, so they might have tremendous potential
to contribute to future information diffusion;
•The intermediate nodes repost some nodes and have also been
reposted by others in observation, i.e., they have both incom-
ing and outgoing edges. These intermediate nodes in common
sense are observed to be reposted for diffusion by consuming a
portion of their influence so that they might have relatively low
contributions compared to nodes in other positions.
As sampling initialization, we assign different weights to sub-
cascades, and users on the above positions, then begin multistep
sampling. In each step, for all unsampled followers, we first ac-
cumulate the weights from their followed users and correlated
sub-cascades, and then we select a batch of followers with the high-
est weight. We repeat the step until all followers are sampled, or
the number of sampled followers reaches the given threshold. The
pseudo-code and detailed descriptions are presented in A.2.
4.1.2 Meta-Edges With Time. We partition the time series in cas-
cade𝑐into𝑇time intervals equally and treat them as a group of time
nodes𝑉𝑐
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒={𝑡0,...,𝑡𝑇−1}. Then, we connect the adjacent time
nodes (corresponding to the adjacent intervals) to get meta-edge
(time, past to, time) :𝐸𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑜(𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑗)=1if𝑖=𝑗−1, else 0.
Compared with a single connection for each user towards a time
node (corresponds to the time interval that the user (re)posts in)
[36], the first step of the innovative soft partition is additionally
considering at most 2𝑆links to adjacent time nodes ( 𝑆time nodes
earlier than it and 𝑆time nodes later than it), which can be regarded
as a subsequent operation after hard partition (the second step is
the attentive GCN mentioned in Sec. 4.2.2). These additional links
connect each user with multiple candidate time intervals and make
the time interval partition learnable by adding learnable weights
to these links. The meta-edge (user, post at, time) is formalized by:
𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡(𝑢,𝑡𝑗)=1if0≤𝑗≤𝑇and|𝑗−𝑘|≤𝑆, else 0. Afterwards,
the meta-edge (time, contain, user) can be obtained by 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛 =
𝐸⊤
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡, where⊤indicates the matrix transpose.
In this way, we construct a heterogeneous graph G𝑐for cascade
𝑐that contains 2types of nodes (i.e., user and time) and 5types of
edges (i.e., repost, follow, past to ,post at andcontains ), as shown in
Figure 3.
4.2 Heterogeneous GNN Driven Inference
As shown in Figure 2, the heterogeneous GNN-driven inference
phase consists of multiple procedures: Firstly, we obtain initial
embeddings of the input; Then, we feed these embeddings into the
stacked GNNs and time embedding layers; Finally, we read out the
predicted value from the learned embeddings. Here, we introduce
the forward inference under mini-batch training.
4.2.1 Embedding Initialization. The first phase is to acquire initial
embeddings for items in G𝑐, and this phase invokes at the beginning
of each forward inference (i.e., after feeding a batch of data to

the model in the training, validation, or test stage). The acquired
initial embeddings can be formulated as X𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚 =IE(G𝑐)(e.g.,
X𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 for user nodes or X𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 for time nodes), where IE(·)refers
to initializing item embeddings. We design two different strategies
to implement IE(·). Firstly, for any type of item (user node or time
node), we assume that there are 𝑛items in a batch and 𝑁items in
the entire dataset. Then, the initial 𝑑-dimensional embeddings are
generated optionally by:
•Learnable embedding strategy (Ln) randomly generates a
global embedding matrix E∈R𝑁×𝑑and saves it. It will return
the corresponding embedding rows X∈R𝑛×𝑑from Efor each
item in the batch when invoked. In this strategy, the embedding
matrix Eis learnable.
•Dynamic embedding strategy (Dy) generates a random matrix
X∈R𝑛×𝑑as the initial embedding when invoked, which allows
an item to get a different embedding at each invoking.
Based on the above strategies, we acquire the node embedding
setX𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 ={X𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟,X𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒}, and compare the performance for
different node embedding initialization strategies in Sec. 5.4. We
utilize the dynamic embedding strategy for edges for the purpose of
memory saving and uncertainty modeling, then we have X𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒=
{X𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡,X𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤,X𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑜,X𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡,X𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛}.
4.2.2 Heterogeneous Graph Convolution. The forward inference of
𝑙-th GCN layer can be formulated in a message-passing manner for
each (head node, edge, tail node) triple(𝑢,𝑒,𝑣). We use xandXto
denote the embeddings of a single node/edge and all nodes/edges
(distinguished by upper and lower case), respectively, and we use (·)
to represent the embedding triples of (𝑢,𝑒,𝑣)(e.g.,(x𝑙−1𝑢,x𝑙−1𝑒,x𝑙−1𝑣)
or(X𝑙−1
𝑇𝑢,X𝑙−1
𝑇𝑒,X𝑙−1
𝑇𝑣)) in corresponding GCN layer for simplicity.
Firstly, we generate a message based on (𝑢,𝑒,𝑣), i.e., MSG(·),
and then pass it by edge 𝑒; Subsequently, the tail node 𝑣aggregates
all messages from its in-coming neighbor nodes, and this process
can be formatted as AGG({MSG(·)|∀(𝑢,𝑒)∈N𝑣}), whereN𝑣is
the set of all in-coming node-edge pairs for 𝑣; Afterwards, each tailnode𝑣’s embedding will be updated by X𝑙𝑣=UPD𝑁(·); Finally, we
also update edges’ embeddings, i.e., X𝑙𝑒=UPD𝐸(·).
Specifically, the message is generated by:
MSG(·)=𝛼𝑇𝑒X𝑙−1

Especially for meta-edges containing both time node and user
node, we apply a softmax for 𝛼𝑇𝑒to normalize the message weights
to help GCN learn the soft partition of time intervals.
Due to the graph’s heterogeneity, we firstly collect messages on
meta-edges for each node, then utilize sum pooling to aggregate
messages passed through meta-edge (𝑇𝑢,𝑇𝑒,𝑇𝑣), i.e.,
AGG𝑇𝑒(·)=SUM
𝑀𝑇𝑒𝑣
,
𝑀𝑇𝑒𝑣=n
MSG(·)|∀(𝑢,𝑒)∈N𝑇𝑒𝑣o
,(3)
where AGG𝑇𝑒is the aggregation on 𝑇𝑒,𝑀T𝑒𝑣refers to the set of all
messages, andN𝑇𝑒𝑣refers to the in-coming node-edge pairs for 𝑣
in meta-edge(𝑇𝑢,𝑇𝑒,𝑇𝑣). After aggregation, we use the attention
mechanism to update node embeddings:
UPD𝑁(·)=𝑇𝑒∑︁
𝑇N𝑣𝛽𝑇𝑒AGG𝑇𝑒(·),
𝛽𝑇𝑒=exp 𝑎𝑇𝑒
Í𝑇𝑒
𝑇N𝑣exp 𝑎𝑇𝑒,𝑎𝑇𝑒=𝑊𝑁1
𝑇𝑒tanh
𝑊𝑁2
𝑇𝑒AGG𝑇𝑒(·)
,(4)
where𝑊𝑁1
𝑇𝑒and𝑊𝑁2
𝑇𝑒are learnable parameters, 𝑎𝑇𝑒is the atten-
tion score and 𝛽𝑇𝑒is the attended weight after softmax. For edges’
update, we simply concatenate the learned embeddings of (𝑢,𝑒,𝑣)
in𝑙-th layer: UPD𝐸=𝑊𝐸,𝑙
𝑇𝑒(X𝑙𝑢||X𝑙𝑒||X𝑙𝑣), where𝑊𝐸,𝑙
𝑇𝑒∈R3𝑑,𝑑is a
learnable parameter, and ||refers to concatenation.
4.2.3 Integrated Time Embedding. We add slots between GCN lay-
ers to integrate the time embedding module for temporal feature
learning via time nodes. We have the following time embedding
modules to integrate:
Time Decay (TD) models the decay effect of source informa-
tion’s influence with the increase of time. The formulation of param-
eterized time decay is given by TD(X𝑙
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒)=𝑊𝑙
𝑇𝐷X𝑙
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒, where
𝑊𝑙
𝑇𝐷is a learnable time decay factor.

RNN andTransformer (TR) [ 32] are devoted to sequential data
learning (e.g., word sequences) and can also be applied to time nodes
in the heterogeneous graph to enhance temporal feature learning.
Bi-GRU [ 9] is used as the instance of RNN in HIF. For Transformer,
HIF mainly stacks its encoder layers [ 32] as the transformer in-
stance. Each Transformer encoder layer learns embeddings via
the multi-head attention and then adds the attended embeddings
with positional encoding to make up for the shortcoming that the
attention mechanism in Transformer ignores the order in input.
4.2.4 Readout. Motivated by [ 46], after𝐿layers of GNN and time
embedding module, we combine the classification task with the pre-
diction task to handle the long-tail cascade distribution. Specifically,
for a cascade 𝑐, we classify its popularity into maximum 𝐿𝑣levels by
the power of 2, and the level of 𝑐is𝐿𝑣𝑐=min(𝐿𝑣,⌊log2|𝑐|⌋). Then,
we utilize the learned embeddings to train a classifier Clsto pre-
dict the level of 𝑐, i.e.,𝑝=softmax(Cls(·))and ˆ𝐿𝑣=arg max𝑖(𝑝𝑖),
where𝑝is the logits output by Cls, and ˆ𝐿𝑣is the predicted level.
We also train 𝐿𝑣regressors that output the predicted popularity at
each level and combine them by the sum pooling weighted by 𝑝:
ˆ𝑦=Í𝐿𝑣
𝑖𝑝𝑖Reg𝑖(·), where Reg𝑖is the regressor for level 𝑖with a
reduced value space for easier prediction. In particular, the Clsand
all Reg𝑖are constructed by MLPs with the same number of layers.
In this way, our readout module combines and solves a multi-
class classification task and a multi-regression task, which dis-
cretizes the long-tailed distribution into several intervals (i.e., the
popularity levels) and then predicts the popularity by multiple re-
gressors in the corresponding intervals. As a result, the model is
capable of learning a more extensive output value range and thus
better handles the problem of data imbalance under the long-tailed
distribution, which is hard to fit by traditional regressors.
4.3 Multi-Task Optimization
We use the mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE) as the metric
to evaluate performance for the same reasons stated in [ 36] (𝐵is
the batch size): 𝑀𝑆𝐿𝐸 =1
𝐵Í𝐵
𝑖(log(𝑦+1)− log(ˆ𝑦+1))2.
To better optimize the readout layer that consists of both re-
gression and classification tasks, we take the cross entropy as the
loss of popularity level classification task for each sample in batch:
𝐶𝐸=−Í𝐿𝑣
𝑖𝐿𝑣𝑖log𝑝𝑖+(1−𝐿𝑣𝑖)log(1−𝑝𝑖), where𝐿𝑣𝑖can be re-
garded as the 𝑖-th value of the one-hot encoded label of the actual
level, e.g., we set 𝐿𝑣to3(starts from 0) and𝐿𝑣𝑐to1, then we have
the one-hot encoded label [0,1,0], and in this case, the 𝐿𝑣0,𝐿𝑣1,
𝐿𝑣2are0,1and 0, respectively.
Besides, we also present a novel Timeline Error (TE) to con-
strain the learned time embeddings for each sample in batch. For
TE, we mainly use cosine similarity (CS) to measure the difference
between two specific time nodes. For 𝑇time nodes, the goal of TE
is to maximize the difference between the first and the last time
nodes and minimize the difference between adjacent time nodes.
For optimization purposes, we rewrite it as a minimization problem:
𝑇𝐸=𝑇−2∑︁
𝑖=0CS(X𝐿
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒[𝑖],X𝐿
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒[𝑖+1])−CS(X𝐿
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒[0],X𝐿
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒[𝑇−1]).
(5)
Finally, we combine metrics and errors from multiple tasks (e.g.,
the TE, CE, and L2 regularization) in a weighted manner as our lossto optimize our framework:
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠=𝑀𝑆𝐿𝐸+𝐵∑︁
𝑖(𝛼1𝑇𝐸𝑖+𝛼2𝐶𝐸𝑖)+𝛼3𝐿2, (6)
where𝛼1,𝛼2, and𝛼3are hyperparameters that weight the metrics
of other tasks, and 𝐿2is the widely used L2 parameter regularization
to avoid overfitting.
5 Experiments
5.1 Datasets
We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets: SSC, MSC,
and Twitter, and the code is open at https://github.com/Les1ie/HIF.
Dataset Twitter [ 10,15,21,40] collects tweets, and followership
from some famous users on Twitter, and it contains single-source
cascades. Datasets SSC and MSC [ 36,44] are collected from Sina
Weibo, where SSC is a single-source dataset that ignores the topic,
while MSC is a multi-source dataset. Table 1 shows the statistics
of datasets. We can observe: 1) Both MSC and SSC contain more
users than Twitter; 2) The followership network and cascades in
MSC and SSC exhibit a broader scale compared to those observed in
Twitter, making the task on datasets SSC and MSC more meaningful
and challenging. Furthermore, we analyze the cascade size of each
dataset in A.3. For the experiment, we select 0.5 h (hour) and 1 h
(hour) as the observation time, respectively.

5.2 Baselines
We select eight state-of-the-art methods as baselines:
FeatureBased simply feeds hand-crafted temporal and spatial
features into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to make a prediction.
We extract effective features including: Temporal features such as
the average time delta of the first half and the last half of the
observed cascade [ 8];Spatial features such as the number of leaf
nodes [ 13], triangles, nodes and edges [ 35] in the cascade graph,
the edge density [43] and clustering coefficient [35].
Node2Vec [12] is a typical node embedding approach, both
walking probabilities 𝑝and𝑞are set to 1.0. We feed the learned
node embeddings to MLP to make predictions.
DeepCas [19] and DeepHawkes [5] are set to sample 100paths
with length 10. The number of time intervals is 6, and probabilities
𝑝and𝑞keep the same as Node2Vec.
TopoLSTM [34] innovatively extends the standard LSTM cell
to a multiple inputs case through mean pooling. We adapt it to the
popularity prediction task by replacing the output layer with MLP.
3465A Deep Prediction Framework for Multi-Source Information via Heterogeneous GNN KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
CoupledGNN [6] models the information state and user state
by two GNNs that are coupled with each other. The number of
GNN layers is 3, and the original loss function is replaced by MSLE.
CasCN [7] presents a dynamic GCN kernel combined with RNN
to handle snapshot graphs. The order of the Chebyshev kernel is 2,
and the number of time intervals is 6.
HERI-GCN [36] integrates RNN into GNN and learns spatial-
temporal features from a heterogeneous graph that contains time
nodes. We set the number of heterogeneous GCN layers to 3, and
set the number of time nodes to 5.
TCAN [27] is built with a CGAT module with 3layers and the
CSAT block with 2layers of Bi-LSTM.
5.3 Performance Comparison
The comparison results between our proposed HIF and baselines
are shown in Table 2. We obtain the following performance-related
observations (POs):

HIF 0.419 0.317 0.555 0.537 0.033 0.023
(PO 1): HIF outperforms all baselines, and meanwhile, HERI-GCN
also performs better than other baselines in most cases because
they not only model both temporal and spatial features but also
utilize followership to discover the potential diffusion paths.
(PO 2): DeepCas performs worst in most cases and even performs
worse under 1 hour of observation compared to 0.5 hours of obser-
vation. The reason is twofold: 1) From the perspective of the model:
the performance of DeepCas depends on the quality of the sampled
paths, but the structural features contained in the sampled paths are
weaker than that in the entire cascade graph (e.g., CoupledGNN).
Furthermore, the sampled paths with backtracking contain chaos
temporal information compared to using the complete time series
directly (e.g., DeepHawkes); 2) From the perspective of data: the ob-
servation times are set to 0.5 hours and 1 hour, and are much shorter
than the observation time settings in DeepCas’s experiments [ 19]
(1, 3, and 5 days for Twitter). It is challenging to extract helpful
information from the paths sampled in short-term observations to
represent the trend of information propagation.
(PO 3): Interestingly, the performance of all methods on the MSC
dataset is somewhat attenuated compared to the SSC dataset. As
evaluated in [ 36], the message propagation prediction in multi-
source cascade considers more potential factors (e.g., potential fol-
lowers who have followed users in several sub-cascades at the sametime) and obtains better results compared to prediction on the SSC
dataset. We conclude that different observation time settings cause
a difference in results. Concretely, the settings of short-term obser-
vation time (e.g., 0.5 h and 1 h) often indicate fewer data available,
and it is hard for models to discover these potential factors from
insufficient information. As a result, making predictions for multi-
source cascades with short-term observation time is challenging.
5.4 Ablation Study
In the ablation study, we compare the variants of HIF to explore
the contribution of different modules:
•For initial embedding strategies (IE), we have two options, i.e.,
theDynamic strategy (Dy) and the Learnable strategy (Ln) as
mentioned in Sec. 4.
•For followership sampling (FS), we also have two options, i.e.,
theHop-based sampling (Hp) [ 36] and the proposed Weighted
dynamic sampling (WD) as mentioned in Sec. 4.
•For time embedding (TE), we have two options of sequential-
input models to further combine with Time Decay, i.e., the Bi-GRU
(RNN) or the encoder of Transformer (TR).
From the results reported in Table 3, we have the following
ablation observations (AOs):

FS: followership sampling, TE: time embedding, and ’-’ means
no corresponding module is used.

(AO 1): For initial embedding strategies, dynamic initialization
achieves better results than the learnable initialization in some
cases (e.g., the results on SSC). We speculate the reason lies in that
the learnable initialization suffers from the unbalanced user distri-
bution, i.e., some users are in the validation set or test set only, and
their embeddings are not optimized during the training. Specifically,
as Table 1 shows, the mean number of cascades involved per user
is1,3, and 2for SSC, MSC, and Twitter, respectively, indicating
that SSC is more likely to suffer from the unbalanced user distribu-
tion than the other two datasets. Besides, the performance is not
determined by the IE module only, even though we fix the other
modules. For example, for a hub-like cascade graph, the source user
is probably the only user that dominates the popularity, and then
the embeddings of reposted users are not crucial for prediction,

ber of users in each type.
ultimately leading to a limited impact of IE strategy on performance.
This also explains why the correlation between performance and
IE on MSC and Twitter is less pronounced than that on SSC.
(AO 2): For the time embedding module, both RNN and Transformer
improve the model performance for most cases. In other words, it is
still tricky to learn the temporal features comprehensively by using
only heterogeneous GNN even though the constructed heteroge-
neous graph already contains temporal information, so we have to
integrate the models such as RNN or Transformer to strengthen the
learning effect. Considering the short-term observation time (0.5 h
and 1 h), the number of time intervals that can be divided is limited;
otherwise, too many time intervals will lead to sparse connections
between time nodes and user nodes. As a result, given the short
input sequence of the temporal embedding module, it is difficult
to directly assert which is a better choice between Transformer
and RNN for all datasets and other modules. Nevertheless, for a
total of 24cases with the same IE, FS, observation, dataset settings,
and different TE modules (except for the cases without TE mod-
ule), there are 16cases in which HIF with Transformer achieves
better performance than RNN, so that Transformer is more likely
to deliver higher performance improvements than RNN.
(AO 3): For followership sampling, the proposed weighted dynamic
sampling is more likely to achieve a better performance in most
cases, because the sampled followership network keeps meaningful
nodes and edges and filters out more redundant nodes and edges
that may disturb the learning, see Sec. 5.5 for more details.
5.5 Case Study
5.5.1 Case Study for Weighted Dynamic Sampling. We compare the
sampled followership network by our proposed weighted dynamic
sampling and 1-hop sampling and draw a specific case in Figure 4.
Figure 4 contains source (red), follower (gray), reposted (orange),
and potential follower (light blue) nodes, and also corresponding
edges (gray for followerships, light blue for followerships by po-
tential users and orange for reposting). These potential followers
follow users in different sub-cascades, so they are simultaneously
influenced by multiple sources, indicating that they are easily influ-
enced to be involved in information diffusion in the future [36].
Comparing subfigures in Figure 4, subfigure 4a has fewer fol-
lowers but the same number of potential nodes This is because we
accrue weights from different sub-cascades for each follower in
addition to considering weights from users in different positions

in the cascade graph when sampling. Therefore, it is easier to dis-
cover followers who have followed multiple users in the cascade
graph at the same time, especially when these followed users are in
different sub-cascades (i.e., these followers are potential followers).
This result demonstrates that the weighted dynamic sampling can
reduce redundancy without losing valuable data.
5.5.2 Case Study for Soft-partition. In Figure 5, we plot the learned
weights of soft-partition edges on the latest GCN layer on SSC
dataset with 0.5-hour observation. Each sub-figure shows a heatmap
of a head’s weights in the multi-head attention for (user, postat, time)
meta-edge. Each pixel represents the connection state of the user
on the Y-axis and the time node on the X-axis. A blank pixel means
no connection, and for a colored pixel, the darker the color, the
higher the attention weight. To better distinguish colored pixels
from blank pixels, we slightly darken the color of the pixels whose
weights are actually very close to zero.
In this case, the number of time nodes is 6, i.e.,𝑡0-𝑡5. In hard-
partition, users 𝑢0-𝑢4(re)post at 18:29-18:33 (the 1st time interval),
and connect to time node 𝑡0; users𝑢5-𝑢7(re)post at the 2nd interval
and connect to 𝑡1;𝑢8-𝑢11(re)post at 3rd, 4th, 4th and 6th intervals,
and connect to 𝑡2,𝑡3,𝑡3and𝑡5, respectively. Here, the soft-partition
is set to 2, and thus each user in the cascade connects to at most
5time nodes and at least 3time nodes. As illustrated in Figure 5,
for each user in the cascade, head 0 pays more attention to the
time node(s) connecting most users; head 26 focuses on almost all
time nodes except one that has low weights; head 22 pays more
attention to the latest connected time nodes, while head 31 pays
more attention to the earliest time node. We interpret that the soft-
partition provides a broader user-wise interval to aggregate features
on the timeline. Specifically, we interpret the results on head 0 as
learning the mean (re)posting time interval of all observed users
that corresponds to the temporal feature of information. Head 26
focuses on filtering out unimportant time node(s) (e.g., 𝑡3in this
case) in a global view. Furthermore, the results on heads 22 and 31
can be interpreted as learning the two ends of time intervals that
correspond to the observed users’ action preferences, reflecting
3467A Deep Prediction Framework for Multi-Source Information via Heterogeneous GNN KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
users’ temporal features. The observation indicates that the soft-
partition enables HIF to learn more useful temporal features.
6 Conclusions
In this work, we proposed a novel framework HIF, to predict the pop-
ularity of multi-source cascade in OSNs. HIF utilizes soft-partition to
learn users’ behavioral preferences, and samples followers through
the efficient weighted dynamic sampling. Combining with multi-
task optimization further enhances HIF’s learning ability on both
long-tail distribution and spatial-temporal features. Through ex-
tensive experiments on real-world datasets, HIF shows excellent
performance against the state-of-the-art methods. In the future, we
intend to extend HIF by NLP models and graph databases to exploit
tweet content and improve efficiency.

A.1 Performance on 𝑅2and MAPE
We further measure the performance of HIF and baselines on the
𝑅2and MAPE, which are widely used in regression tasks, and the
results are shown in Figure 6. The 𝑅2of some methods are negative,
which are not plotted. Since the extreme values contribute differ-
ently to different metrics, some order changes in the performance
of the baselines are observed, but the overall performance of HIF
is still the best. Moreover, we can see that the performances are
consistent with the MSLE that we analyzed in PO1, PO2 and PO3.

A.2 Details of Weighted Dynamic Sampling
The weighted dynamic sampling is designed to take advantage of
differentiated contributions to sample followership. Accordingly,
we firstly assign different weight bases 𝜙𝑠,𝜙𝑟,𝜙𝑙for nodes in dif-
ferent positions in a cascade graph and assign a weight 𝜙𝑐to all
sub-cascades. Let 𝛼and𝛽be the scale factors that limit the number
Γof sampled users, i.e., Γ=𝛼|𝑉𝑐T
𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟|+𝛽. In Algorithm 1, lines 1-6
are set for initialization, where Sis the collection of node sets for
sub-cascades,His the set of candidate followers, and N𝑖is the
follower set for each user 𝑖in cascade𝑐.
We sample step by step until no more followers in Hto sample
or|𝐸𝑓,𝑐|reaches Γ. We select only a batch of followers in each
sampling step. At the beginning of each step, we first update the
weights for users in the cascade (lines 8-12) according to their
positions and the number of unsampled followers. Then, we update
the weights of the users’ followers in each sub-cascade 𝑠(lines
13-18) and build a set 𝑓𝑐to collect all followers for users in 𝑠(line
14). Line 16shows two weight accumulations: one is to accumulate
the weight for every user in 𝑠to his/her followers’ weights (the
summation term in line 16); the other is to further add weight 𝜙𝑐
to the weights for all followers of 𝑠. LetΠdenote the maximum
number of sampled followers in the current step, and we then select
Πfollowers according to their weights to set B. Finally, we remove
BfromHand mergeBinto𝐸𝑓,𝑐.
We provide an example in Figure 7 to illustrate the weighted dy-
namic sampling step by step. This cascade contains 2 sub-cascades,
and we set𝜙𝑠=3,𝜙𝑟=1,𝜙𝑙=2,𝜙𝑐=3,𝜋=2,Γ=5for simplicity,
i.e., at most two followers are sampled at each step, with a total of
five followers. Specifically, at step 0, we get the weights for users
and followers via lines 8-18 in Algorithm 1, and select the 𝑓2and𝑓0
with the largest weights. For instance, the intermediate user 𝑢2has
3followers, and its weight is 𝑤2=𝜙𝑟+ln(1+3)−ln(1+0)≈2.4;
𝑓2follows𝑢2and𝑢5from two unioque sub-cascades, so 𝑓2’s weight
is𝑤𝑓2=𝑤2+𝑤5+2𝑤𝑐=11.1, which is the largest and results
the selection of 𝑓2at step 0. Similarly, we update the weights and
select𝑓1and𝑓6at step 1. Following the update of weights and the
selection of 𝑓3at step 2, the value of |𝐸𝑓,𝑐|reaches Γ, so we stop
sampling with the final state shown at step 3.

cascades, and the solid lines illustrate the final cascade size (the
ground-truth), which follows a long-tail distribution.
Furthermore, we analyze the cascade spread size (in percentage)
in relation to the time of spread (in hours) in the MSC and SSC.
The results are depicted in Figure 9. Notably, we can observe a
restricted scale of information diffusion over short durations. For
instance, the average cascade sizes after 0.1hours are a mere 0.017%
for SSC and 0.022% for MSC, indicating a limited utility of model
predictions during this early stage. The average time required for
information to reach 10%of its final size is found to be 38.2hours
for SSC and 29.9hours for MSC.
It is worth noting that previous studies, including [ 5,19,36,41],
have consistently demonstrated that longer observation periods
contribute to more accurate predictions. Consequently, in Sec. 5,
we deliberately opt for the more challenging observation times of
0.5 and 1 hour to evaluate our proposed framework.
A.4 Efficiency Analysis
We further compare the number of followerships sampled by differ-
ent methods and the total time cost consumed by HIF and baselines.
A.4.1 Sampled Followership. We compare the followerships sam-
pled by hop-based sampling and weighted dynamic sampling, and
the results are shown in Figure 8b. In this case, the settings for
weighted dynamic sampling are the same as the settings in Sec.
5.5.1. For 1-hop sampling, it samples relatively few followerships
for short cascades on the Twitter dataset and samples a large fol-
lowership network for long cascades on datasets SSC and MSC,
which leads to either insufficiency or redundancy of followership
network for Twitter or SSC/MSC.

In comparison, the proposed weighted dynamic sampling sam-
ples more followerships for short cascades to provide sufficient
beneficial information and also has a tighter upper bound for large
cascades to avoid the low efficiency of the framework’s inference.
A.4.2 Time Cost. We analyze the time cost of HIF and baselines
and plot the results of 1-hour observation in Figure 10. The time
cost for each model is mainly determined by both the time of the
training step (i.e., the time of forward inference and backward prop-
agation, depending on the model’s complexity) and the convergence
capability (which determines the total number of training steps). It
implies that the simplest model is not necessarily the fastest one,
e.g., the FeatureBased and the Node2Vec are slower than DeepCas
on datasets SSC and MSC. It is worth mentioning that HIF is more
efficient than CasCN and HERI-GCN in most cases, though it is

not the fastest one. Overall, HIF achieves a good trade-off between
efficiency and performance.
A.5 Sensitivity Analysis
Many notable hyperparameters might have impacts on the model
inference and data structure. We use the MSC dataset to investigate
the effect of these hyperparameters, including the number 𝑆of soft-
partition edges per user, the number 𝑇of time nodes, the number 𝐿
of GCN layers, the timeline error weight 𝛼1and the CE loss weight
𝛼2. As illustrated in Figure 11, we explain the observations below:
•The number of time nodes determines the private receptive field
of each time node, and the number of soft-partition edges deter-
mines the shared receptive field of each user. These two hyper-
parameters are complementary to each other, and determine the
total receptive field to users for each time node commonly.
•As the number of GCN layers increases from 1up to 6, the perfor-
mance first improves and then falls since the shallow model has
limited learning ability, while the deep model is easy to suffers
from over-fitting.
•We select multiple representative values for the weight of timeline
loss, and the results demonstrate that timeline loss with a suitable
weight (e.g., 10−3for 0.5-hour observation and 5×10−5for 1-hour
observation) can benefit the prediction performance.
•With regard to the CE loss weight 𝛼2, the results show that the
best performance is achieved when 𝛼2is set to 0.2for 0.5-hour
observation and 0.15for 1-hour observation.

darker the color, the higher the property value. "Trans." is the abbreviation of transitivity.
A.6 Interpretability Analysis
In this section, we visualize the learned information cascade embed-
ding by projecting the embeddings as 2D points via t-SNE[ 4] and
coloring these points by hand-crafted properties. The visualization
results are drawn in Figure 12 under 1-hour observation.
The properties to be visualized include the final popularity (i.e.,
the ground-truth of our task), the density of the cascade graph, the
transitivity of sampled followership network, the kurtosis, and the
skew of the time series. The former three are the spatial properties
coming from the cascade graph and the followership network. The
latter two temporal properties come from the (re)posting time series,
where the skewness reflects the stage of information diffusion. In a
complete diffusion process, the popularity is in the tendency of low
- high - low. The kurtosis coefficient demonstrates the explosion
of information diffusion. These two temporal coefficients jointly
reflect the state of the information diffusion process. We measurethe HIF’s learning ability of spatial-temporal features by the corre-
lation between the learned embeddings (the position of points) and
these manually extracted properties (the color of points).
We can observe a noticeable correlation between the color gra-
dient and the position of the points (e.g., in Figure 12(l) indicating
that the embeddings learned by our framework can better reflect
the spatial-temporal properties of the original data, i.e., HIF learns
spatial-temporal features well.
The multi-source cascade aggregates sub-cascades with different
kurtosises and skewnesses and released at different times, so the
distribution of the MSC temporal feature scatter is more uniform.
The observation duration in our settings (i.e., 0.5 h and 1 h) is too
short to observe a prominent diffusion process (as shown in Figure
8a), resulting in a uniform distribution of temporal property scatters
on SSC and Twitter datasets. However, we still observe that each
point has a similar skewness or kurtosis as its nearest neighbor.
