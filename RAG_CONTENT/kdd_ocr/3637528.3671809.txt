ABSTRACT
The next Point-of-interest recommendation has attracted exten-
sive research interest recently, which predicts users’ subsequent
movements. The main challenge is how to effectively capture users’
personalized sequential transitions in check-in trajectory, and vari-
ous methods have been developed. However, most existing studies
ignore the temporal information when conducting the next POI rec-
ommendation. To fill this gap, we investigate a time-specific next
POI recommendation task, which additionally incorporates the
target time information. We propose a brand new Time2Rotation
technique to capture the temporal information. Different from con-
ventional methods, we represent timeslots as rotation vectors and
then perform the rotation operations. Based on the Time2Rotation
technique, we propose a novel rotation-based temporal attention
network, namely ROTAN, for the time-specific next POI recom-
mendation task. The ROTAN begins by building a collaborative POI
transition graph, capturing the asymmetric temporal influence in
sequential transitions. After that, it incorporates temporal informa-
tion into the modeling of individual check-in trajectories, extracting
separate representations for user preference and POI influence to
reflect their distinct temporal patterns. Lastly, the target time is
integrated to generate recommendations. Extensive experiments
are conducted on three real-world datasets, which demonstrates the
advantages of the proposed Time2Rotation technique and ROTAN
recommendation model.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as
Foursquare and Google Maps, allow users to share their geographic
locations through check-ins at points of interest (POI) on social
networks. POIs typically represent specific geographical locations
that users may find valuable or interesting, e.g.,shopping malls
and restaurants. The increasing availability of online check-in data
enables the POI recommendation problems [ 24,33] that aim to
suggest potential locations for users based on their preferences
and context information. Among the variants of POI recommen-
dation tasks, the next POI recommendation problem [ 3,20,22,56]
has attracted extensive research attention recently. Different from
traditional POI recommendations, the next POI recommendation
predicts users’ next visits by incorporating sequential transitions
and spatial-temporal context information.
A large variety of methods [ 8,13,28,30,38,43–45,47,50] have
been proposed for the next POI recommendation task. Convention-
ally, two kinds of methods have been commonly utilized: the graph
neural networks [ 17,43,44,47,51] for learning diverse relations,
and the recurrent neural networks or transformer based meth-
ods [ 8,21,26,50,55,56] for modeling the trajectories. However,

Next POI Recommendation
Time -Specific Next POI Recommendation
Figure 1: Conventional next POI recommendation task might
overlook the importance of specific times in POI recommen-
dations, whereas the time-specific next POI recommendation
additionally considers the target time. For instance, the user’s
choice of next POIs at 4 PM and 8 PM could vary significantly.
most existing approaches focus solely on recommending subse-
quent locations without considering the target time information.
For example, as shown in Figure 1, a user sequentially visits the
zoo, snack bar, cinema, and library. Viewing the check-in trajectory
as a sequence, the conventional next POI recommendation task
primarily focuses on predicting the next location. However, recom-
mendations at 4 PM and 8 PM should be different as user preference
may vary with time. For example, users might prefer museums at
4 PM but favor bars at 8 PM. Additionally, POIs may have time-
related characteristics, like opening hours. For instance, at 8 PM,
recommending a museum that has already closed at 6 PM would
be inappropriate. Hence, we introduce a novel research task, i.e.,
time-specific next POI recommendation, which considers the target
time information when generating the next POI recommendation.
The main distinction from the conventional next POI recom-
mendation lies in the effective modeling of temporal information
in user check-in trajectories. To investigate the temporal patterns
of user sequential movements, we perform data observations and
analyses on real-world check-in datasets (cf. Section 3). As shown
in Figure 2, we observe that temporal information plays an impor-
tant role in user consecutive check-ins, and asymmetric temporal
influence is evident. In addition, as illustrated in Figure 3, users and
POIs tend to exhibit different temporal patterns. These findings not
only underscore the importance of temporal information but also
present the following challenges of effectively integrating temporal
information for time-specific next POI recommendations.
The first challenge is temporal information representation. Exist-
ing POI recommendation methods typically incorporate temporal
information by representing time as an embedding vector. Then,
the time embeddings are added or concatenated with POI and user
embeddings [ 26,44,47,50]. Those methods may increase the di-
mension and change their original spaces. In addition, this manner
cannot naturally reflect the periodic temporal patterns that are
essential in user behaviors. Hence, we need to design a novel ap-
proach to incorporate temporal information. The second challenge
is time-aware sequential transitions. Existing methods often neglect
temporal information when constructing transition graphs for the
next POI recommendation. For instance, [ 50] simply constructs a
user-agnostic POI-to-POI transfer graph, [ 30] considers relations
between users and POIs without temporal aspects, and [ 44] de-
velops an adaptive POI graph. However, careful consideration oftemporal information is crucial, e.g.,how to capture the asymmet-
ric temporal influence. The third challenge involves integrating
various factors. Incorporating temporal information into various
elements like user preference, POI sequential patterns, etc., proves
to be a hard task. Data observations reveal that users and POIs
display distinct temporal patterns. Current methods [ 20,26,50]
often confound these factors, obscuring their contributions and
hindering overall improvement.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel ROtation-based
Temporal Attention Network (ROTAN). For integrating temporal
information into embeddings, we introduce a new technique called
Time2Rotation. Inspired by the success of Rotation methods in
knowledge graph embeddings[ 1,32,36], Time2Rotation encodes
the timeslot as a rotation. For a given POI or user, the temporal
information of timeslot 𝑡is incorporated by applying the rotation op-
eration. This approach offers two advantages: it naturally captures
periodicities and does not alter the original embedding space. To
account for asymmetric temporal relations in user trajectories, each
timeslot can be assigned a source rotation and target rotation. This
study is the first to employ rotation operations for incorporating
temporal information in recommendation systems, distinguishing
itself from conventional concatenation or addition operations.
Building on the Time2Rotation technique, we can generate time-
specific POI recommendations by learning from collaborative POI
transitions and individual check-in trajectories. Firstly, for collab-
orative POI sequential transitions, we create a time-aware POI
transition graph where nodes represent POIs and relations convey
temporal information. Each transition is modeled as a quadruplet
comprising the source POI, source timeslot, target POI, and target
timeslot. We utilize the Time2Rotation to model these sequential
transitions. Secondly, we incorporate temporal information into
learning user individual check-in trajectories. Recognizing that
users and POIs exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we model their
sequences separately. Source time rotation operations are applied
to integrate temporal influence into the user and POI temporal
sequence attention modules. This process extracts representations
of user preference sequence and POI influence sequence for a given
trajectory, capturing long-term sequential dependencies through
attention mechanisms. Finally, Time2Rotation is utilized to inte-
grate target time into these representations, which are combined to
determine final scores for time-specific next POI recommendations.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
•We investigate a time-specific next POI recommendation
task that considers the target time when making subsequent
POI recommendations, which is more challenging than the
conventional next POI recommendation task.
•We introduce a Time2Rotation technique, encoding a given
timeslot as rotations. This method naturally captures period-
icity without altering the original space. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to explore rotation operations to capture
temporal information in user mobility behaviors.
•We propose a novel rotation-based temporal attention net-
work. It utilizes Time2Rotation to consider temporal infor-
mation in both global collaborative POI transitions and indi-
vidual user check-in trajectories, and then incorporates the
target time to generate recommendations.

2 RELATED WORK
The POI recommendation task [ 24,33] has been extensively stud-
ied, and various approaches have been proposed [ 15,23,25,29,39,
40,42]. Several variants of the POI recommendation problem have
emerged. In this section, we delve into two related variants, i.e.,the
next POI recommendation and the time-aware POI recommenda-
tion. We also provide a literature review on rotation techniques.
2.1 Next POI Recommendation
Different from the conventional POI recommendation task, the key
of next POI recommendation is effectively modeling the diverse
interactions and sequential patterns in user check-in trajectories.
Recently, a variety of methods have been developed. To capture
the diverse relations in user check-in data, the graph neural net-
works [17,30,43,44,47,51] are exploited. For instance, to harness
collaborative signals from other users, [ 50] builds a POI-POI trajec-
tory flow graph, and [ 44] develops an adaptive graph representation
network. Yan et al. [47] present a hypergraph convolutional network
that considers high-order transition information and incorporates
trajectory similarities. Moreover, as the check-in trajectories can be
regarded as sequences, the recurrent neural networks [21,56] and
transformers [8,26,50,55] are leveraged to capture the complex de-
pendencies in user’s sequential movementes. For example, to model
the check-in sequence, GetNext [ 50] develops a graph-enhanced
Transformer model and AGRAN [ 44] designs a attention-based
sequential model. CLSPRec [ 8] exploits a shared transformer to
jointly learn long sequences and short sequences. However, exist-
ing studies focus on the conventional recommendation setting and
ignore the target time of the recommendation, which may result in
unreasonable recommendations and suboptimal performance.
Various factors have been considered for the POI recommenda-
tion, such as the categories [ 7], hierarchical structures [ 21], social
relationships [ 17], etc. Among them, the geographical and temporal
information are crucial factors that distinguish the next POI recom-
mendations from other sequential recommendation tasks [9]. The
geographical influence often be captured by spatial distances [ 44,
47] or region embeddings [ 20,26], which are further incorporated
into the RNN-based methods [ 22,35,56], transformer-based meth-
ods [ 27,38], and graph-based methods [ 15,23]. Similarly, the tem-
poral information is commonly modeled as the temporal inter-
val [38,44,47] or embedding of time [ 8,26,28,50], and then incor-
porated into the trajectory prediction models.
In practice, almost all next POI recommendation methods have
jointly considered spatial and temporal information when modeling
the check-in sequences. For example, Zhao et al. [56] propose a
Spatio-Temporal Gated Network (STGN) to capture personalized
sequential patterns for users’ long and short-term preferences. [ 27]
develops a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) that incor-
porates the impacts of non-adjacent locations and non-consecutivecheck-ins. In the recent methods, e.g.,[44,47], the spatial distances
and temporal interval information are aggregated into the attention
mechanisms to capture spatial-temporal information. In another
line of recent approaches, e.g.,[8,26,50], the spatial and tempo-
ral information are captured by the representation learning. This
work also considers the spatial and temporal context for recommen-
dations but focuses more on the temporal information. Different
from existing methods that employ concatenation or addition oper-
ations, we leverage the rotation operations to incorporate temporal
influence, which has not been studied before.
2.2 Time-aware POI Recommendation
Extensive studies have demonstrated the importance of temporal
factors in user mobilities [ 24,33]. The time-aware POI recommen-
dation [ 14,19,53,57] focuses on suggesting POIs for a user at a
specified time of day. Yuan et al. [53] introduce this task and de-
velop a collaborative filtering approach to integrate temporal and
spatial information into the scoring calculation. Li et al. [19] em-
ploy a high-order tensor factorization method for time-aware POI
recommendation. Overall, time-aware POI recommendation does
not consider sequential movement information and has received
much less research attention than the next POI recommendation.
The additional time information, e.g.,periodic patterns, has also
been considered for the next POI recommendation [ 5,10,41,52].
However, existing studies do not explicitly consider the target time
when predicting the next locations. Very recently, Luo et al. [26]
leverages timestamps as prompts in the location recommendation
task, which is very close to our work. Specifically, it develops a
temporal prompt-based and geography-aware (TPG) framework.
The temporal information is encoded by 168 (24 ×7) embedding
vectors, which will be used in the trajectory modeling and POI
recommendation. The decoder of TPG takes a specific time as a
temporal prompt to generate recommendations, by concatenating
time embeddings with other embeddings. In contrast, we employ
the rotation operation to integrate temporal influence, and extract
different temporal patterns for user preference and POI influence.
2.3 Rotation Techniques
Sunet al. [36] introduce the rotation techniques for modeling mul-
tiple relations and develop a novel RotatE method for knowledge
graph embedding, where each relation is described as a rotation
from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vec-
tor space. Following this, other rotation-based knowledge graph
embedding methods have been developed [ 1,6,32,46]. Rotation
techniques have found applications in various research domains.
For example, [ 34] proposes a rotary positional encoding method for
transformer-based language models, which is employed in the re-
cent large language models (e.g., LLaMA [ 37] and GLM-130B [ 54]).
Feng et al. [11] combines the rotation operations with hyperbolic
spaces to capture asymmetric proximity and hierarchical structures
in directed graphs. Chen et al. [2] propose a learning-to-rotate at-
tention module within the Quaternion transformer framework to
capture the periodical patterns in time series forecasting tasks.
Recently, RotatE has been used in POI recommendation tasks.
[51] applies the RotatE algorithm for learning the POI transition
graph and multi-step dependency with RNN structures. [ 39] adopts

the RotatE technique to learn entity representations from various
types of graphs. These methods directly use RotatE to capture
knowledge graphs related to POIs. Different from them, our ap-
proach explores rotation operations to model temporal information
and considers asymmetrical sequential transitions.
3 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND ANALYSIS
3.1 Problem Definition
LetU={𝑢1,𝑢2,...,𝑢𝑀}andP={𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝𝑁}be the set of
users and POIs, respectively. Each POI 𝑝is associated with a ge-
ographical coordinate (i.e., longitude and latitude), which reflects
its geospatial position. A check-in is represented by 𝑐=(𝑢,𝑝,𝑡),
which denotes that user 𝑢visits POI𝑝at timestamp 𝑡. In this work,
we split the original timestamp into 𝑇timeslots in a day or week.
Hence,𝑡denotes a specific temporal timeslot.
A check-in trajectory is defined by a sequence of temporally or-
dered check-in records for a particular user. We use 𝑇𝑢𝑖= {𝑐1,𝑐2,. . . ,𝑐𝑙}
to represent the trajectory sequence of user 𝑢𝑖. Following existing
studies (e.g., [50]), we partition all check-ins of a specified user into
check-in trajectories by 24-hour intervals.
Definition 1: Next POI Recommendation (NPR). Given a
user𝑢𝑖and his recent check-in trajectory 𝑇𝑢𝑖= {𝑐1,𝑐2,. . . ,𝑐𝑙}, it aims
to predict the potential POIs that user 𝑢𝑖will most likely to visit
subsequently.
Definition 2: Time-Specific Next POI Recommendation
(TS-NPR). Given a user 𝑢𝑖, his recent check-in trajectory 𝑇𝑢𝑖=
{𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑙}, and a specific target time 𝑡𝑇𝑔𝑡, it aims to predict the
POIs that user 𝑢𝑖will most likely to visit subsequently at the given
timeslot𝑡𝑇𝑔𝑡.
Compared with the traditional NPR task, the TS-NPR additionally
incorporates the target time 𝑡𝑇𝑔𝑡when recommending the next POI,
which is more challenging.
3.2 Data Observations and Analyses
To better solve the TS-NPR problem, we conduct data observations
based on real-world datasets. Firstly, we examine the temporal
characteristics of POI-POI sequential transitions. Using check-in
trajectory data, we extract the temporal information associated with
each POI-POI transition. The hour distribution of the NYC dataset
is presented in Figure 2. Similar temporal patterns are observed in
other datasets (Reported in the Appendix.). We have two findings:
(1) Close hours exhibit relatively higher transition frequency (e.g.,
the elements near the diagonal in the transition matrix.), under-
scoring the significance of temporal influence in user sequential
movements. This finding is consistent with previous studies [ 12].
(2) Asymmetric temporal influence is evident in consecutive check-
ins. For instance, there are more sequential transitions from 6 AM
to 8 AM than the counts from 8 AM to 6 AM. These asymmetric
patterns have not been extensively explored in previous studies.
Secondly, we investigate the temporal patterns of both users and
POIs, as depicted in Figure 3. The X-axis represents the number
of hours a user has check-ins (or a POI has been visited), while
the Y-axis indicates the count of such users and POIs. We can
learn that Users are active during more hours, as seen in their
broader hour ranges. In contrast, the hour distribution of POIs is
more concentrated, indicating that most POIs are accessible during

The distinct temporal distributions of users and POIs necessitate
separate modeling approaches.

4 THE ROTAN METHOD
The overall framework of the ROTAN model is shown in Figure
4, which encompasses three major components. Firstly, to make
full use of the POI sequential transitions of all users, we utilize
a collaborative POI transition graph learning module to extract
general temporal relations among POIs. Secondly, we develop a
novel individual check-in trajectory learning component to cap-
ture both the long-term sequential dependencies and temporal
information. This involves utilizing two distinct transformers for
user temporal sequence and POI temporal sequence to reflect the
different temporal patterns of users and POIs. Lastly, the learned
trajectory representations and the input target time are combined
to recommend the time-specific next POIs. Notably, the above three
components exploit a Time2Rotation (T2R) technique to incorpo-
rate the temporal information. In the following sections, we will

Figure 4: The overview of the rotation-based temporal attention network (ROTAN). It mainly consists of three components:
the collaborative POI transition graph learning, the individual check-in trajectory modeling, and the time-specific next POI
recommendation. All the above modules exploit the Time2Rotation (T2R) technique to incorporate temporal information.
first introduce the Time2Rotation approach and then present the
three major components.
4.1 Time2Rotation
As an important factor in POI recommendation, temporal informa-
tion has been widely investigated. Previous solutions either use
the time interval (e.g., the time difference between two consecutive
check-ins) [ 38,44] or timeslot’s embedding [ 26,50] (e.g., regarding
timeslots as entity nodes and learning their representations) to
reflect the relative or absolute temporal influence in user check-in
trajectories. Different from them, we explore the rotation technique
for incorporating temporal information, which has not been stud-
ied before. This concept is inspired by circular patterns inherent
in temporal information, such as daily and weekly periodicities.
Human behaviors are closely tied to these periodic patterns, such
as having breakfast in the morning and having dinner at night. This
temporal information and periodicity intuitively correlate with ro-
tation, similar to how time information can be symbolized by the
rotation of clock hands.
To capture periodic patterns in user mobility, various cyclic func-
tions, e.g.,sine function [ 18] and havercosine function [ 48], have
been employed. However, the conventional methods of integrating
temporal information, such as directly using it as temporal weights
or concatenating timeslot embeddings, may not effectively model
the temporal influence on other entities. For instance, concatenat-
ing time embeddings to users or POIs might increase the embedding
dimension and alter their original vector spaces. Inspired by the
RotatE approach [ 36], which has been proven effective for knowl-
edge graph embedding, we propose to capture temporal influence
by rotation operations.
Following the RotatE [ 36], rotations are modeled via unitary
complex numbers (Alternative ways, e.g.,the block-diagonal trans-
formation matrices [ 1], can also be used to model rotations.). As
indicated by Euler’s identity 𝑒𝑖𝜃=cos𝜃+𝑖sin𝜃, a unitary complex
number can be naturally viewed as a rotation in the complex plane.
The mathematical definition of Time2Rotation (T2R) is stated as fol-
lows. Given an embedding vector h∈C𝑑, the temporal informationof timeslot tis incorporated by applying the rotation operation:
𝑇2𝑅(h,r𝑡)=h◦r𝑡, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒|r𝑡|=1. (1)
Here, r𝑡∈C𝑑denotes the rotation related to timeslot 𝑡, and “◦”
denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product. Compared with the
traditional strategies (e.g., concatenation or addition), this rotation
method does not modify the original space of embedding h.
Additionally, the Time2Rotation technique further considers two
important temporal factors. First, a given timeslot 𝑡would serve
two roles: being influenced by activities in earlier timestamps or
influencing future behaviors. Unlike existing solutions that assign
only one embedding for each timeslot, we represent each timeslot
with two rotations: one source rotation r𝑆𝑟𝑐
𝑡and one target rotation
r𝑇𝑔𝑡
𝑡to capture asymmetric temporal relations. Second, in real-
world scenarios, user mobility data exhibit multiple periodicities,
e.g.,daily and weekly patterns. Following [ 50], we divide one day
into 48 timeslots 𝑡𝑑(each representing 0.5 hours) to indicate daily
periodicity. We also divide one week into 7 timeslots 𝑡𝑤(each
representing 1 day) to represent weekly periodicity. These two
periodicities can be combined to reflect the multi-periodic temporal
patterns in user behaviors, as elaborated later.
4.2 Collaborative Transition Graph Learning
Since the check-in records of each user are sparse, we attempt to
utilize the sequential transitions of all users. We first construct a
collaborative POI-POI transition graph. Different from studies [ 44,
50,51] that merely consider the sequential transition relations, we
additionally incorporate the temporal information.
A user’s current check-in was affected by the locations they have
visited before and would influence the user’s future movements.
Hence, given a trajectory 𝑇={𝑐1,𝑐2...𝑐𝑙}, we can extract 𝑙−1
transitions. Each transition is represented by a quadruplet:
𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑑𝑖=(𝑝𝑖,𝑡𝑖,𝑝𝑖+1,𝑡𝑖+1). (2)
Each𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑑𝑖means that a user first visits 𝑝𝑖at time𝑡𝑖, and then moves
to location 𝑝𝑖+1at time𝑡𝑖+1. We define the temporal transition

indicate the rotated POI embeddings, and ∥·∥denotes the L1-norm.
Different from the RotatE [ 36] that considers the triplet of two
entities and one relation, we leverage the T2R to address the time-
aware quadruplet. By reducing the 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑑 𝑖, we can learn temporal
sequential patterns, where the timeslot’s different roles are encoded
by source rotation and target rotation, respectively.
Following [ 36], we can exploit the widely used negative sampling
strategy to optimize the POI transition graph. This enables the
extraction of POI embeddings and temporal rotations, forming
the foundational elements for long-term trajectory modeling, as
elaborated in the subsequent section.
4.3 Individual Check-In Trajectory Learning
Next, we will present how to learn the check-in trajectory by incor-
porating temporal information. The main challenge lies in jointly
modeling various crucial factors, including user preference, influ-
ence, geographical influence, and temporal information.
Given a check-in trajectory sequence 𝑇𝑢𝑖= {𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑙}, we at-
tempt to extract the trajectory representation. Alongside the men-
tioned POI embedding and time rotations, we also integrate User
embedding and spatial embedding. Each user is assigned an embed-
ding vector, which reflects the user’s personalized interest. For the
geographical influence, we use GeoEncoder [ 20] to get the spatial
embeddings. Given the POI’s coordinates (i.e., longitude and lati-
tude), a hierarchical map gridding is exploited to generate its spatial
embedding. These embeddings are collectively used to encode the
check-ins in trajectories.
There are two important elements: user preference and POI in-
fluence, both containing sequence information. Notably, users and
POIs exhibit distinct temporal patterns, as illustrated in Figure 3.
Therefore, choosing independent time encoding models for users
and POIs becomes necessary. Motivated by this, we employ two
transformers for user temporal sequence modeling and POI tempo-
ral sequence modeling, differing from prior studies that typically
use the same sequence model for both.
4.3.1 User Temporal Sequence Modeling. Given each check-in 𝑐=
(𝑢,𝑝,𝑡)in the observed trajectory, we employ source temporal ro-
tations to capture its influence on subsequent check-ins. Acknowl-
edging the existence of multiple periodicities in user behaviors,
we consider daily and weekly patterns using two distinct types of
rotations. Then, the user’s temporal representations are extracted:
zu
d=𝑇2𝑅𝑆𝑟𝑐(u′,tu
d),zu
w=𝑇2𝑅𝑆𝑟𝑐(u′,tu
w). (4)
Here, u′=u∥prepresents the user’s preference for POIs, and ∥
denotes the concatenation operation. tu
dandtuwdenote the daily
and weekly periodic temporal rotations for user preferences. After
that, these two representations can be fused to obtain zu:
zu=𝛼∗zu
d+(1−𝛼)∗zu
w, (5)
where𝛼∈[0,1]represents the weight for daily periodicity. In this
manner, the user embedding zuis enriched with multi-periodic
temporal information.To model the long-term dependency in check-in trajectory, we
use the attention mechanism to calculate the trajectory embeddings.
Given the input 𝑧𝑢, we compute the linearly transformed features:
𝑄=𝑧𝑢𝑊𝑄, 𝐾=𝑧𝑢𝑊𝐾, 𝑉=𝑧𝑢𝑊𝑉. (6)
Here,𝑊𝑄,𝑊𝐾and𝑊𝑉are learnable parameters. We process the
above features through a multi-head self-attention model:
𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 1,...,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑ℎ)𝑊𝑂,
ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖=𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄𝑊𝑄
𝑖,𝑄𝑊𝐾
𝑖,𝑉𝑊𝑉
𝑖),
𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑄𝐾𝑇
√
𝑑𝑉.(7)
The outputs from different attention heads are combined using a
linear transformation 𝑊𝑂to merge the information from various
attention spaces.
Afterward, a fully connected neural network (FNN) is applied
following the multi-head attention model. This process results in
the user temporal trajectory representation:
gu=𝐹𝑁𝑁 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉), (8)
where𝐹𝑁𝑁()represents the commonly used feed-forward network.
The gupreserves the historical user preference information.
4.3.2 POI Temporal Sequence Modeling. The POI sequence reflects
the inherent sequential patterns of POIs, providing valuable in-
formation for predicting the subsequent locations. Similar to user
preference, we incorporate temporal information into the POI se-
quence.
Firstly, the POI embeddings are rotated by daily and weekly
rotations, defined as follows:
zp
d=𝑇2𝑅𝑆𝑟𝑐(p′,tp
d),zp
w=𝑇2𝑅𝑆𝑟𝑐(p′,tp
w). (9)
Here, p′=p∥s, and sdenotes the spatial embedding of the POI.
Then, these two rotated POI embeddings are fused to obtain
multi-periodic temporal information:
zp=𝛼∗zp
d+(1−𝛼)∗zp
w. (10)
Lastly, similar to the user temporal sequence modeling, the POI
sequence representation gpis learned using a multi-head attention
model followed by a fully connected neural network. The obtained
representation gpcaptures the spatial and temporal information as
well as complex sequential POI dependencies in the given trajectory.
4.4 Time-Specific Next-POI Recommendation
4.4.1 Incorporating the Target Time. In the TS-NPR problem, target
time information is explicitly considered as the input. After the
above check-in trajectory learning, we can obtain the two indepen-
dent representation vectors: i.e.,user preference representation gu
and POI influence representation gp. Subsequently, Time2Rotation
is employed to blend the target time into these vectors. Additionally,
the multi-periodicity of temporal information is integrated.
The user preference at the target time is calculated as:
gu′
d=𝑇2𝑅𝑇𝑔𝑡(gu,tu
d),gu′
w=𝑇2𝑅𝑇𝑔𝑡(gu,tu
w),
gu′=𝛼∗gu′
d+(1−𝛼)∗gu′
w,(11)
 
764ROTAN: A Rotation-based Temporal Attention Network for Time-Specific Next POI Recommendation KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
where tu
dandtuwdenote the user’s daily and weekly time rotations
for the target time. Similarly, the POI preference at the target time
is computed as :
gp′
d=𝑇2𝑅𝑇𝑔𝑡(gp,tp
d),gp′
w=𝑇2𝑅𝑇𝑔𝑡(gp,tp
w),
gp′=𝛼∗gp′
d+(1−𝛼)∗gp′
w,(12)
where tp
dandtp
wrepresent the POI’s daily and weekly time rotations
for the target time.
The recent spatial information is also crucial in POI recommen-
dation [ 12], which can provide geographical context information.
Based on the latest checked-in POI in the given trajectory, we can
get its spatial embedding sby the GeoEncoder [ 20]. Hence, we fur-
ther incorporate the latest POI embedding pland spatial embedding
slto output the final representations:
ou=gu′∥pl,op=gp′∥sl. (13)
In this manner, we can get the time-specific user preference repre-
sentation ouand POI influence representation op, which capture
information about the current trajectory and the target time.
4.4.2 Predicting the Next POI. Based on the obtained two represen-
tations ouandop, we leverage the MLP as the decoder to compute
POI recommendation scores.
First, we calculate the user preference score yuand POI influence
score ypseparately:
yu=𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(ou·Wu+bu), (14)
yp=𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(op·Wp+bp). (15)
Here, Wu∈𝑅𝑑×𝑁,Wp∈𝑅𝑑×𝑁,bu∈𝑅𝑁, and bp∈𝑅𝑁are learn-
able parameters. 𝑁denotes the number of POIs in the dataset.
After that, the final recommendation score yis calculated as
y=𝛽∗yu+(1−𝛽)∗yp, (16)
where𝛽∈[0,1]represents the contribution of user preference
and(1−𝛽)indicates the impact of POI influence. We utilize the
commonly used cross-entropy function as the loss function and
exploit the L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.

5 EXPERIMENTS
5.1 Experimental Settings
5.1.1 Datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-
world datasets: Foursquare-NYC [ 49], Foursquare-TKY1[49] and
Gowalla-CA [ 4]2. We follow the pre-processing approach in [ 47].
The check-in records are chronologically sorted, with the first 80%
assigned to the train set, the middle 10% to the validation set, and
the last 10% to the test set. Dataset statistics are reported in Table 1.
1https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset
2https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html5.1.2 Baselines. We evaluate the following four types of methods:
(1) Traditional sequential recommendation methods ( FPMC [31]
andPRME [12]) that utilize the conventional matrix factoriza-
tion and metric embedding techniques; (2) RNN-based methods
(LSTM [16],STRNN [22],STGN [56], and PLSPL [45]) that incor-
porate spatial and temporal information into the Recurrent neu-
ral networks; (3) Transformer-based methods (STAN [27],GET-
Next [50],CLSPRec [8], and AGRAN [44]) that leverage the at-
tention mechanisms to model check-in sequences; (4) Time-aware
next POI recommendation method (TPG [26]) that uses timestamps
as prompts for geography-aware location recommendation.
GETNext, CLSPRec, and AGRAN are state-of-the-art methods for
the NPR task, and we slightly adapt them to the TS-NPR problem.
GETNext and AGRAN additionally utilize the GNN techniques for
POI graphs. TPG is particularly relevant to ours, which considers
the timestamp for the next location prediction.
5.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. Following [ 50], we utilize the Accuracy@k
and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which are widely used in recom-
mendation systems. Acc@k indicates whether the true POI appears
in the top-k recommended POIs. MRR measures the index of the
correctly recommended POI in the ordered result list.
More details of the datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and
implementations can be found in the Appendix.
5.2 Main Results
Table 2 displays the experimental results3of time-specific next POI
recommendation across three datasets. Based on the results, the fol-
lowing observations can be made: (1) The recent Transformer-based
methods outperform early-stage methods (FPMC and PRME) and
RNN-based methods (LSTM, STRNN, STGN, and PLSPL), suggesting
that the transformer is suitable for modeling the user check-in tra-
jectories. (2) The GNN-enhanced transformer-based methods (e.g.,
GETNext and AGRAN) achieve better scores than the transformer-
only methods (STAN and CLSPRec). This indicates that the ex-
tracted or adaptively learned POI graphs provide additional global
sequential transition information, improving the recommendation
performance. (3) Generally, the TPG model is able to obtain bet-
ter results compared to the latest next POI recommendation ap-
proaches. This is because TPG utilizes timestamps as prompts to
predict future movements, showing that target time information
helps make more accurate recommendations. (4) The proposed
ROTAN significantly outperforms all baselines across the three
datasets. For instance, ROTAN can surpass the strong baselines by
achieving 22-26% higher Acc@1 and 12-22% higher MRR scores.
Notably, ROTAN significantly outperforms the TPG, which is the
state-of-the-art time-specific next POI recommendation method. In
summary, the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the ROTAN method, which leverages Time2Rotation technique for
both POI transition graph and check-in trajectories.
5.3 Ablation Studies
To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in ROTAN,
we conduct the following ablation studies. (1) w/o Graph: We
only utilize the check-in Trajectory learning module, removing

the collaborative POI transition graph. (2) w/o T2R: We remove the
Time2Rotation technique and incorporate the temporal information
through concatenation, which is the same as TPG [ 26]. (3) w/o Tgt:
We do not consider the target time. This is the same setting as the
conventional next POI recommendation task. (4) w/o User: We only
keep the POI temporal sequence modeling module, and remove the
representation of user preference. (5) w/o POI: We only keep the
user temporal sequence modeling, and remove the representation of
POI influence. (6) U&P: We do not separately consider the temporal
influence on user preference and POI sequence representations. In-
stead, we merge them and learn trajectory simultaneously, aligning
with the GETNext [50].
Table 3 presents the ablation study results on the NYC and CA
dataset. We can draw the following observations. (1) Without the
collaborative POI transition graph, the performance of ROTAN will
decrease. This suggests that global sequential relations can allevi-
ate the data sparsity, thereby improving the personalized check-
in sequence prediction. (2) We observe that the results are much
worse if Time2Rotation is removed, showing the superiority of
Time2Rotation over the straightforward concatenation approach
widely used in previous methods. (3) Removing target time infor-
mation leads to a notable decrease in performance. It underscores
the crucial role of target time in the next POI recommendation,
justifying the significance of the TS-NPR task. (4) Performance no-
tably declines when the user temporal sequence modeling module is
removed, indicating the importance of user preference in POI recom-
mendation tasks. (5) Removing the POI temporal sequence module
results in a slight performance decline, indicating the lesser signif-
icance of the POI sequence compared to user preference. Hence,
solely considering check-in trajectories as POI sequences may not
be effective, highlighting the need to consider interactions between
users and POIs. (6) Modeling temporal information for user prefer-
ence and POI sequence with a single transformer is less effective
than separately incorporating their temporal patterns. This is be-
cause users and POIs may exhibit distinct temporal patterns.Table 3: The results of ablation studies.

5.4 Sensitivity Analyses
5.4.1 The weight 𝛼for periodicities . We explore the impact of the
weight parameter 𝛼in combining daily and weekly periodicities
(i.e.,𝛼in Equations 5, 10, 11, and 12). By varying 𝛼, we observe
its influence on performance, as shown in Figure 5a. The results
indicate that combining both daily and weekly temporal patterns
is effective. Using only daily periodicity (i.e., 𝛼=1.0) or weekly
periodicity alone (i.e., 𝛼=0.0) is less effective. The best results
are achieved with a weight of 0.7 for daily periodicity and 0.3 for
weekly periodicity. This suggests that daily patterns play a more
significant role than weekly patterns, aligning with our common
knowledge that daily patterns are stronger than weekly patterns.
5.4.2 The weight 𝛽.User preference and POI influence are two
crucial factors in our model, combined to calculate the final recom-
mendation scores. Figure 5b shows the impact of different weights,
i.e.,varying𝛽values in Equation 16. Observations indicate that
combining user preference and POI sequence is more effective than
relying solely on user preference ( 𝛽=1.0) or POI sequence pattern
(𝛽=0.0). Notably, the best results are obtained when the 𝛽is around
0.7. This suggests that user preference plays a more significant role,
which is consistent with our findings in the ablation studies.
5.4.3 Granularity of time slots. We examine how the number of
timeslots per day, which represents the time granularity, affects our
model’s performance, as depicted in Figure 5c. Although there’s a

slight performance improvement with finer time granularity, overall
our model’s performance remains stable. In summary, ROTAN is
not significantly affected by the number of time slots.
5.4.4 The number of dimensions. We study the impact of varying
numbers of dimensions. Figure 5d indicates that performance tends
to improve with the increase of dimensions. However, performance
starts to drop if the number of dimensions exceeds 256. Empirically,
the best performance is achieved when the number of dimensions
is 256. It is important to note that, for a fair comparison with other
baselines, the default value is set to 128 in this paper.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we study a new time-specific next POI recommenda-
tion problem that aims to provide accurate next recommendations
at the given timestamp. We introduce an innovative Time2Rotation
technique to effectively capture temporal information, which en-
codes timeslots as rotations and employs rotation operations to
incorporate temporal influence. Building upon this technique, we
propose ROTAN, a rotation-based temporal attention network for
the time-specific next POI recommendation task. The ROTAN uti-
lizes collaborative POI transition graph learning and individual
check-in trajectory learning to learn representations of user tempo-
ral sequence and POI temporal sequence, which are combined with
the input target information to produce time-specific recommen-
dations. The extensive experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed Time2Rotation technique and the
ROTAN recommendation model.

visit records in history, 3) divide user check-in records into several
trajectories.
A.2.2 Baseline Descriptions. We evaluate the following methods:
•FPMC [ 31]: A personalized Markov chain framework, which
learns both user preference and poi sequential pattern.
•PRME [ 12]: A metric embedding-based method, which jointly
incorporates sequential transition, user preference, and geo-
graphical influence.
•LSTM [ 16]: A variant of the RNN model, which handles long
sequence dependency and Vanishing gradient problems.
•STRNN [ 22]: A RNN-based method, considering the temporal
and spatial interval information.
•STGN [ 56]: A RNN-based method, which adds two time gates
and two distance gates to LSTM.
•PLSPL [ 45]: A RNN-based method, which learns the user’s
long-term pattern by using attention mechanism and short-
term preference. and short-term preference with LSTM
•STAN [ 27]: A transformer-based method, which modifies
the attention coefficients using temporal and spatial interval
information.
•GETNext [ 50]: A transformer and GNN-based method, which
employs a user-agnostic global trajectory flow map and a
novel Graph Enhanced Transformer model.
•CLSPRec [ 8]: A transformer and RNN-based method, which
uses the attention mechanism to obtain long-term preference
and RNN to get short-term preference.
•AGRAN [ 44]: A transformer and GNN-based method, which
uses an adaptive graph to avoid manually building a graph.
•TPG [ 26]: A transformer-based method, which explicitly uses
target times as prompts for the geography-aware location
recommendation. Its experimental setup is similar to ours.
A.2.3 Evaluation Metric Descriptions. In this work, we utilize two
widely used measure metrics for evaluating the recommendation
performance. Given a test set with msamples (trajectories), the
metrics (Accuracy@k and MRR@k) are calculated as:
𝐴𝑐𝑐@𝑘=1
𝑚𝑚∑︁
1ℎ𝑖𝑡𝑠(𝑖), 𝑀𝑅𝑅 =1
𝑚𝑚∑︁
11
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖
ℎ𝑖𝑡𝑠(𝑖)=(
1if𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖<=𝑘
0otherwise(17)
 
769KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Shanshan Feng, Feiyu Meng, Lisi Chen, Shuo Shang, & Yew Soon Ong
Here,𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖represents the rank of the ground truth next POI in the
recommended list. In general, for all these metrics, a higher value
indicates better performance.
A.2.4 Implementation Details. We use the PyTorch framework to
develop and train our model. We conduct experiments on the follow-
ing hardware (CPU: Intel Xeon Silver 4214R, GPU: NVIDIA GeForce
RTX 3090 24GB). The hyperparameters for our experiments are as
follows: the embedding dimensions for POI and user are set to 128,
while the rotation dimensions for time are 64. We employ Adam asthe model optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and weight decay of
8e-4. The learning rate scheduler is set as CosineLRScheduler, with
a minimum learning rate of 1e-5, warm-up steps at 10, and warm-up
learning rate initialized at 1e-4. Additionally, the hyperparameters
for the Transformer are configured as follows: transformer-head as
2, transformer-hidden as 1024, transformer-layer as 4, and dropout
as 0.4. We also incorporate the GeoEncoder [ 20] in our embedding
layer, setting the embedding dimensions for geography at 128, the
quadkey length at 25, and the number of grams at 6. Training is
performed on three datasets for 60 epochs with a batch size of 128.
