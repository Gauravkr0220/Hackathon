ABSTRACT
Time Series Representation Learning (TSRL) focuses on generating
informative representations for various Time Series (TS) model-
ing tasks. Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in
TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial,
contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensi-
tivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based
methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However,
they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation
and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for
generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE),
bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach.
TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an
Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a train-
able embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer
encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We
train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings,
designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive ex-
periments demonstrate TSDE’s superiority in imputation, interpo-
lation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering.
We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualiza-
tions, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE’s
efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.

1 INTRODUCTION
Time Series (TS) data is a sequence of data points collected at regular
time intervals. It is prevalent in various real-world applications,
such as understanding human behavioral patterns [ 9], conducting
in-depth financial market analyses [ 5], predicting meteorological
phenomena [ 34], and enhancing healthcare diagnostics [ 46]. In
this work, we focus on Multivariate TS (MTS) data, which refers
to a TS with multiple variables or features recorded at each time
point, where these variables may have inter-dependencies. This is
in contrast to Univariate TS (UTS), which only involves a single
variable. It should be noted that Multiple TS (Multi-TS) differs from
MTS as it pertains to the simultaneous monitoring of several UTSs,
each operating independently without any interrelation among
them. While this paper primarily concentrates on MTS data, our
methodology and insights are also applicable to UTS and Multi-TS,
ensuring the versatility and broad applicability of our approach.

To effectively extract and interpret valuable information from
intricate raw MTS data, the field of Time Series Representation
Learning (TSRL) has become increasingly pivotal. TSRL focuses on
learning latent representations that encapsulate critical information
within the time series, thereby uncovering the intrinsic dynamics
of the associated systems or phenomena [ 52]. Furthermore, the
learned representations are crucial for a variety of downstream ap-
plications, such as time series imputation, interpolation, forecasting,
classification, clustering and anomaly detection. TSRL can be con-
ducted in a supervised manner; however, the need for extensive and
accurate labeling of vast time series data presents a significant bot-
tleneck, often resulting in inefficiencies and potential inaccuracies.
Consequently, our focus lies in unsupervised learning techniques,
which excel in extracting high-quality MTS representations without
the constraints of manual labeling.
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), a subset of unsupervised learn-
ing, has emerged as a highly effective methodology for TSRL. SSL
utilizes innovative pretext tasks1to generate supervision signals
from unlabeled TS data, thereby facilitating the model’s ability to
autonomously learn valuable representations without relying on
external labels. The four main designs of SSL pretext tasks – recon-
structive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive [ 18,42,52,100] –
will be elaborated in Section 2. These designs have demonstrated
notable success in addressing TSRL across a diverse range of appli-
cations, yet they often struggle with capturing the full complexity
of MTS data, particularly in modeling intricate long-term depen-
dencies and handling high-dimensional, noisy datasets.
Due to their advanced generative capabilities, diffusion models
[28,71,73–76] have emerged as a promising solution for TS model-
ing, adept at handling the complexities and long-term dependencies
often found in MTS data. While these methods have shown success
in specific tasks like forecasting [ 62] and imputation [ 80], their
adoption in SSL TSRL remains largely unexplored, leaving a gap
in the related research literature. Our work, Time Series Diffusion
Embedding (TSDE), pioneers in this area by integrating conditional
diffusion processes with crossover Transformer encoders and intro-
ducing an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask strategy.
This unique combination allows TSDE to generate versatile repre-
sentations that are applicable to a wide range of tasks, including
imputation, interpolation, forecasting, classification, anomaly de-
tection, and clustering. Our main contributions are:
•We propose a novel SSL TSRL framework named TSDE, which
optimizes a denoising (reverse diffusion) process, conditioned on
a learnable MTS embedding function.
•We develop dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders integrated
with a crossover mechanism, which learns MTS embeddings by
capturing temporal dynamics and feature-specific dependencies.
•We design a novel SSL pretext task, the IIF masking strategy,
which creates pseudo observation masks designed to simulate
the typical imputation, interpolation, and forecasting tasks.
•We experimentally show that TSDE achieves superior perfor-
mance over existing methods across a wide range of MTS tasks,
thereby validating the universality of the learned embeddings.
1A pretext task in SSL is a self-generated learning challenge designed to facilitate the
extraction of informative representations for downstream tasks, encompassing various
methods such as transformation prediction, masked prediction, instance discrimination,
and clustering, tailored to the specific data modality involved [21, 33, 100].2 RELATED WORK
This research addresses the problem of TSRL using a SSL approach.
Inspired by the taxonomies adopted by [ 18,42,52,100], we structure
our review of SSL-based TSRL around four primary methodologies:
reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive methods.
Reconstructive methods focus on minimizing the discrepancy
between original and reconstructed MTS data, mostly using an
encoder-decoder Neural Network (NN) architecture to emphasize
salient features and filter out noise, thereby training the NN to learn
meaningful representations [ 27]. Recent mainstream methods in
this category predominantly employ Convolutional NN (CNN) [ 72,
99], Recurrent NN (RNN) [ 47,65] or Transformer [ 15,102] as their
architectural backbone. In this category, deep clustering stands
out by simultaneously optimizing clustering and reconstruction
objectives. It has been implemented through various clustering
algorithms, including 𝑘-means [ 7,88], Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) [ 4,32], and spectral clustering [ 79]. Reconstructive meth-
ods might face limitations in addressing long-term dependencies
and adequately representing complex features such as seasonality,
trends, and noise in extensive, high-dimensional datasets.
Adversarial methods utilize Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) to learn TS representations by differentiating between real
and generated data [ 50,58]. These methods often integrate ad-
vanced NN architectures or autoregressive models to effectively
capture temporal dependencies and generate realistic TS data. For
instance, TimeGAN [ 93] combines GANs with autoregressive mod-
els for temporal dynamics replication, while RGAN [ 22] uses RNN
to enhance the realism of generated TS. Furthermore, approaches
like TimeVAE [ 16] and DIVERSIFY [ 44] innovate in data generation,
with the former tailoring outputs to user-specified distributions and
latter employing adversarial strategies to maximize distributional di-
versity in generated TS data. However, the intricate training process
of GANs, potential for mode collapse, and reliance on high-quality
datasets are notable drawbacks of adversarial methods, potentially
generating inconsistent or abnormal samples [100].
Contrastive methods distinguish themselves by optimizing
self-discrimination tasks, contrasting positive samples with similar
characteristics against negative samples with different ones [ 106].
These methods learn representations by generating augmented
views of TS data and leveraging the inherent similarities and vari-
ations within the data [ 100]. They include instance-level mod-
els [11,12,78,91] that treat each sample independently, using
data augmentations to form positive and negative pairs. Prototype-
level models [ 8,37,51,98], on the other hand, break this indepen-
dence by clustering semantically similar samples, thereby captur-
ing higher-level semantic information. Additionally, temporal-level
models [ 19,78,90,95] address TS-specific challenges by focusing on
scale-invariant representations at individual timestamps, enhanc-
ing the understanding of complex temporal dynamics. However,
a common disadvantage across these contrastive methods is their
potential to overlook higher-level semantic information, especially
when not integrating explicit semantic labels, leading to the gener-
ation of potentially misleading negative samples.
Predictive methods excel in capturing shared information from
TS data by maximizing mutual information from various data slices
or augmented views. These methods, like TST [ 97], wave2vec [ 67],

CaSS [ 14] and SAITS [ 17], focus on predicting future, missing, or
contextual information, thereby bypassing the need for full input
reconstruction. Most recent advancements in this category, such
as TEMPO [ 3] and TimeGPT [ 25], leverage LLM (Large Language
Model) architectures to effectively decompose and predict complex
TS components. TimeGPT, in particular, stands out as a foundation
model specifically for TS forecasting, yet it only treats MTS as Multi-
TS. Lag-Llama [ 61], another notable predictive model, demonstrates
strong univariate probabilistic forecasting, trained on a vast corpus
of TS data. However, the challenge in these methods is their focus
on local information, which can limit their capacity to capture long-
term dependencies and make them susceptible to noise and outliers,
thus affecting their generalization ability.
Diffusion-based methods in TS modeling have recently gained
traction, leveraging the unique abilities of diffusion models to model
the data distribution through a process of injecting and reversing
noise [ 100]. These models, like TimeGrad [ 62] and CSDI [ 80], have
been effectively applied to tasks such as forecasting and imputa-
tion, employing innovative techniques like RNN-conditioned diffu-
sion and multiple Transformer encoders. Recent developments like
SSSD [ 2] have further evolved the field by integrating structured
state space models [ 26] with diffusion processes. These advance-
ments have showcased the flexibility and potential of diffusion
models in handling diverse TS data, with applications ranging from
electrical load forecasting with DiffLoad [ 83] to predicting spatio-
temporal graph evolutions using DiffSTG [ 84]. Despite these sig-
nificant advancements, a notable gap remains in the application of
diffusion models for TSRL. While a recent study [ 13] demonstrates
the efficacy of diffusion models as robust visual representation ex-
tractors, their specific adaptation and optimization for TSRL have
not been explored. Our work aims to fill this gap with the innovative
TSDE framework, synergistically integrating conditional diffusion
processes and crossover Transformer encoders, coupled with an
innovative IIF mask strategy, to effectively tackle a wide range of
downstream tasks.
3 THE APPROACH
The task entails learning general-purpose embeddings for MTS
that has𝐾features/variables and 𝐿time steps. Formally, given a
multivariate time series x:
x={𝑥1:𝐾,1:𝐿}=𝑥1,1𝑥1,2... 𝑥 1,𝐿
𝑥2,1𝑥2,2... 𝑥 2,𝐿
............
𝑥𝐾,1𝑥𝐾,2... 𝑥𝐾,𝐿∈R𝐾×𝐿, (1)
we aim to learn a 𝝓-parameterized embedding function f𝝓(·)that
maps the input MTS xto a latent representation Z:
Z={z1:𝐾,1:𝐿}=f𝝓(x)=z1,1... z1,𝐿
.........
z𝐾,1... z𝐾,𝐿∈R𝐾×𝐿×𝐶,(2)
where each element z𝑘,𝑙∈R𝐶represents the embedding vector for
the𝑘-th feature and 𝑙-th step, with 𝐶denoting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. We propose to learn f𝝓by leveraging a
conditional diffusion process trained in a self-supervised fashion.3.1 Unconditional Diffusion Process
The unconditional diffusion process assumes a sequence of latent
variables x𝑡(𝑡∈Z∩[1,𝑇]) in the same space as x. For unification, we
will denote xasx0henceforth. The objective is to approximate the
ground-truth MTS distribution 𝑞(x0)by learning a 𝜽-parameterized
model distribution 𝑝𝜽(x0). The entire process comprises both for-
ward and reverse processes.
3.1.1 Forward process. In this process, Gaussian noise is gradually
injected to x0in𝑇steps until𝑥𝑇is close enough to a standard
Gaussian distribution, which can be expressed as a Markov chain:
𝑞(x1:𝑇|x0)=Î𝑇
𝑡=1𝑞(x𝑡|x𝑡−1), (3)
where𝑞(x𝑡|x𝑡−1)is a diffusion transition kernel, and is defined as
𝑞(x𝑡|x𝑡−1):=N(x𝑡;√︁
1−𝛽𝑡x𝑡−1,𝛽𝑡I), (4)
which is a conditional Gaussian distribution with a mean of√︁
1−𝛽𝑡x𝑡−1and a covariance matrix of 𝛽𝑡I, and𝛽𝑡∈(0,1)indicates
the noise level at each diffusion step 𝑡. Because of the properties of
Gaussian kernels, we can sample any x𝑡from x0directly with
𝑞(x𝑡|x0):=N(x𝑡;√︁
˜𝛼𝑡x0,(1−˜𝛼𝑡)I),where ˜𝛼𝑡:=Î𝑡
𝑖=1(1−𝛽𝑖),(5)
andx𝑡=√˜𝛼𝑡x0+√1−˜𝛼𝑡𝝐, and 𝝐∼N( 0,I).
3.1.2 Reverse process. This process, modeled by a NN parameter-
ized with 𝜽, recovers x0by progressively denoising x𝑇:
𝑝𝜽(x0:𝑇)=𝑝(x𝑇)Î𝑇
𝑡=1𝑝𝜽(x𝑡−1|x𝑡), (6)
where𝑝𝜽(x𝑡−1|x𝑡)is the reverse transition kernel with a form of
𝑝𝜽(x𝑡−1|x𝑡):=N(x𝑡−1;𝝁𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡),𝚺𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡)). (7)
To approximate the reverse transition kernel, Ho et al. [ 29] propose
the following reparametrization of the mean and variance:
𝝁𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡):=(1−𝛽𝑡)−1
2(x𝑡−𝛽𝑡(1−˜𝛼𝑡)−1
2𝝐𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡)), (8)
𝚺𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡):=𝝈𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡)I=𝜎2
𝑡I, (9)
where𝜎2
𝑡=𝛽𝑡(1−˜𝛼𝑡−1)/(1−˜𝛼𝑡)when𝑡>1, otherwise 𝜎2
𝑡=𝛽1;
𝝐𝜽is a trainable network predicting the noise added to input x𝑡at
diffusion step 𝑡. Specifically, ˜𝛼𝑇≈0such that𝑞(x𝑇)≈N( x𝑇; 0,I),
thus the starting point of the backward chain is a Gaussian noise.
3.2 Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting Mask
The reverse process of unconditional diffusion facilitates the genera-
tion of MTS from noise. However, our objective is to create general-
purpose embeddings for unlabeled MTS, which can be leveraged
in many popular downstream tasks such as imputation, interpo-
lation, and forecasting. Consequently, we propose an Imputation-
Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask strategy, producing a pseudo
observation mask mIIF={𝑚IIF
1:𝐾,1:𝐿}∈{0,1}𝐾×𝐿where𝑚IIF
𝑘,𝑙=1if𝑥𝑘,𝑙
in Equation (1)is observable, and 𝑚IIF
𝑘,𝑙=0otherwise. Algorithm 1
details the implementation and combination of imputation, interpo-
lation, and forecasting masks2. During training, given any original
MTS x0, we extract the observed ( xobs
0) and masked ( xmsk
0) segments
by
xobs
0:=x0⊙mIIFand xmsk
0:=x0⊙(m−mIIF), (10)
2Theimputation mask simulates random missing values; the interpolation mask mimics
the MTS interpolation tasks by masking all values at a randomly selected timestamp;
and the forecasting mask assumes all values post a specified timestamp unknown.

Figure 1: The TSDE architecture comprises an embedding function (left) and a conditional reverse diffusion block (right): the
temporal and spatial encoders are implemented as one-layer Transformer.
where⊙represents element-wise product; and m={𝑚1:𝐾,1:𝐿}∈
{0,1}𝐾×𝐿is a mask with zeros indicating originally missing values
inx0. We now reformulate our self-supervised learning objective to
generate the masked version of MTS, denoted as xmsk
0, from a cor-
rupted input xmsk
𝑡, through a diffusion process, conditioned on
the embedding of the observed MTS xobs
0, i.e.,f𝝓(xobs
0). Both the
diffusion process (parameterized by 𝜽) and the embedding function
(parameterized by 𝝓) are approximated with a trainable NN.
3.3 Conditional Reverse Diffusion Process
Our conditional diffusion process estimates the ground-truth con-
ditional probability 𝑞(xmsk
0|f𝝓(xobs
0))by re-formulating (6) as
𝑝𝜽(xmsk
0:𝑇|f𝝓(xobs
0)):=𝑝(xmsk
𝑇)Î𝑇
𝑡=1𝑝𝜽(xmsk
𝑡−1|xmsk
𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0)).(11)
Similar to (7), the reverse kernel 𝑝𝜽(xmsk
𝑡−1|xmsk
𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0)):=
N(xmsk
𝑡−1;𝝁𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0)),𝚺𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0))). (12)
According to DDPM [ 29], the variance 𝚺𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0))can be
formulated in the same way as (9), i.e., 𝝈𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0))I=𝜎2
𝑡I.
Similar to Equation (8), the conditional mean 𝝁𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡,f𝝓(xobs
0)):=
(1−𝛽𝑡)−1
2(xmsk
𝑡−𝛽𝑡(1−˜𝛼𝑡)−1
2𝝐𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡|f𝝓(xobs
0))).(13)
3.4 Training Loss and Procedure
It has been shown in [ 29] that the reverse process of unconditional
diffusion can be trained by minimizing the following loss:
L(𝜽):=Ex0∼𝑞(x0),𝝐∼N( 0,I),𝑡∥𝝐−𝝐𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡))∥2
2. (14)
Inspired by [ 80], we replace the noise prediction NN 𝝐𝜽(x𝑡,𝑡)with
the conditioned version 𝝐𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡|f𝝓(xobs
0)in (14), obtaining
L(𝜽,𝝓):=Ex0∼𝑞(x0),𝝐∼N( 0,I),𝑡∥𝝐−𝝐𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡|f𝝓(xobs
0))∥2
2.(15)Given the focus of training is solely on predicting the noise at the
non-missing and masked locations, we actually minimize eL(𝜽,𝝓):=
Ex0∼𝑞(x0),𝝐∼N( 0,I),𝑡∥(𝝐−𝝐𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡|f𝝓(xobs
0)))⊙( m−mIIF)∥2
2.(16)
The self-supervised and mini-batch training procedure, detailed
in Algorithm 2, essentially attempts to solve min𝜽,𝝓eL(𝜽,𝝓). In
each iteration 𝑖of the training process, a random diffusion step 𝑡is
chosen, at which point the denoising operation is applied.
3.5 Embedding Function
The left part of Figure 1 illustrates the architectural design of the
embedding function f𝝓(xobs
0). This figure highlights that the func-
tion not only processes the input xobs
0, but also incorporates ad-
ditional side information (namely, time embedding stime(𝑙), fea-
ture embedding sfeat(𝑘), and the mask mIIF) into its computations.
Consequently, the notation f𝝓(xobs
0)is succinctly used to repre-
sent the more extensive formulation f𝝓(xobs
0,stime,sfeat,mIIF), which
accounts for all the inputs processed by the function. To obtain
128-dimensional stime(𝑙), we largely follow [80, 107]:
stime(𝑙)=
sin𝑙
𝜏0
64,..., sin𝑙
𝜏63
64,cos𝑙
𝜏0
64,..., cos𝑙
𝜏63
64
,(17)
where𝜏=10,000 and 𝑙∈Z∩[1,𝐿]. For sfeat(𝑘), a 16-dimensional
feature embedding is obtained by utilizing the categorical feature
embedding layer available in PyTorch. The observable segment xobs
0
undergoes a nonlinear transformation and is then concatenated
with time and feature embeddings, resulting in ˜xobs
0∈R𝐾×𝐿×160:
˜xobs
0=𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑢(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(xobs
0)),stime,sfeat), (18)
where𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(·),𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑢(·)and𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(·)represent concatenation,
ReLu activation, and 1×1 convolution operation [39] respectively.
To accurately capture the inherent temporal dependencies and
feature correlations in MTS data, thereby enabling clearer data in-
terpretation and a customizable, modular design, we devise separate
temporal and feature embedding functions: g𝛾(˜xobs
0)andh𝛿(˜xobs
0),

parameterized by 𝛾and𝛿respectively. Inspired by [ 80], both the
temporal g𝛾(·)and feature g𝛿(·)encoders are simply implemented
as a one-layer Transformer encoder that takes an input tensor
shaped𝐾×𝐿×160, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, the temporal
encoder operates on tensors shaped 1×𝐿×160, representing a fea-
ture across all timestamps; and the feature encoder handles tensors
shaped𝐾×1×160, representing a feature vector corresponding to a
time stamp.
To integrate temporal and feature embeddings in varying orders
without adding to the model’s trainable parameters, we have de-
veloped a crossover mechanism. This mechanism is depicted by
the red and blue arrows in Figure 1. It facilitates the generation
ofg𝛾(h𝛿(˜xobs
0))andh𝛿(g𝛾(˜xobs
0)), which are subsequently trans-
formed and concatenated along with mIIF, resulting in the final
embedding Z=f𝝓(xobs

where𝑆𝑖𝐿𝑢(·)is the Sigmoid-weighted Linear Unit (SiLU) activation
function [ 20]. Once the model is trained, the embedding for any
MTS x0is computed following Equations (18)and(19), where xobs

3.6 The Overall Architecture
Figure 1 provides a comprehensive depiction of the various com-
ponents within the TSDE architecture. The process begins by ap-
plying the IIF mask mIIFto partition the input MTS into observable
(xobs
0) and masked ( xmsk
0) segments. The entire architecture primarily
consists of two key elements: (1) an embedding function f𝝓(xobs
0)
thoroughly introduced in Section 3.5; and (2) a conditional reverse
diffusion module, illustrated on the right side of Figure 1.
The conditional reverse diffusion, introduced in Section 3.3, func-
tions as a noise predictor, effectively implementing 𝝐𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡|f𝝓(xobs
0)).
During the𝑖-th training step, as outlined in Algorithm 2, the sam-
pled diffusion step 𝑡is first transformed into a 128-dimensional
vector, denoted as sdiff(𝑡):=
sin(100·4
63𝑡),..., sin(1063·4
63𝑡),cos(100·4
63𝑡),..., cos(1063·4
63𝑡)
.(20)
Subsequently, the MTS embedding Z, along with sdiff(𝑡)andxmsk
0,
are input into a residual block composed of 𝑁residual layers. The
outputs of these layers are aggregated (summation), processed
through some transformations, and combined with xmsk
𝑡. This re-
sults in 𝝐𝜽(xmsk
𝑡,𝑡|f𝝓(xobs
0))⊙( m−mIIF), which is then utilized to
compute the loss eL(𝜽,𝝓), as formulated in Equation (16).Algorithm 2: TSDE Training Procedure

3.7 Downstream Tasks and Model Efficiency
The trained model can be utilized in two scenarios: (1) the embed-
ding function, as a standalone component, can be used to generate
comprehensive MTS representations, which are suitable for various
downstream applications including anomaly detection, clustering,
and classification as demonstrated in Section 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4, re-
spectively. (2) When combined with the trained conditional reverse
diffusion process, the model is capable of predicting missing val-
ues (for imputation and interpolation) as well as future values (for
forecasting) in MTS data. In the second scenario, a notable increase
in speed can be achieved compared to the existing diffusion-based
methods such as those in [ 62,80]. This efficiency, confirmed in Sec-
tion 4.1.5, stems from simplifying the conditional reverse diffusion
(the right block of Figure 1, i.e., 𝝐𝜽) to use only Conv1 ×1 operators.
This streamlining significantly accelerates the 𝑇=50 steps reverse
diffusion process.
4 EXPERIMENTS
Our evaluation of the TSDE framework includes thorough experi-
ments across six tasks (imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anom-
aly detection, classification, and clustering) accompanied by addi-
tional analyses on inference efficiency, ablation study, and embed-
ding visualization. For experiment details, dataset specifications,
hyperparameters, and metric formulas, refer to Appendix of [ 68].
4.1 Imputation, Interpolation and Forecasting
4.1.1 Imputation. We carry out imputation experiments on Phys-
ioNet3[70] and PM2.54[92]. TSDE is benchmarked against several
state-of-the-art TS imputation models. These include BRITS [ 6], a
deterministic method using bi-directional RNN for correlation cap-
ture; V-RIN [ 53], employing variational-recurrent networks with
feature and temporal correlations for uncertainty-based imputa-
tion; GP-VAE [ 24], integrating Gaussian Processes with VAEs; and
CSDI [ 80], the top-performing model among the diffusion-based
3PhysioNet, a healthcare dataset with 4,000 records of 35 variables over 48 hours, is
processed and hourly sampled as [ 66,80], leading to∼80% missing rate. For testing, we
randomly mask 10%, 50%, and 90% of observed values to create ground-truth scenarios.
On this dataset, we pretrain TSDE for 2,000 epochs, followed by a 200-epoch finetuning
with an imputation mask.
4PM2.5, an air quality dataset, features hourly readings from 36 Beijing stations over 12
months with artificially generated missing patterns. Adapting [ 80], each series spans
36 consecutive timestamps. On this dataset, we pretrain for 1,500 epochs and finetune
for 100 epochs using a history mask as detailed in Algorithm 5 in [68].

TS imputation models. The model performance is evaluated us-
ing continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) to assess the fit
of predicted outcomes with original data distributions, and two
deterministic metrics – mean absolute error (MAE) and the root
mean square error (RMSE). Deterministic metrics are calculated
using the median across all samples, and CRPS value is reported as
the normalized average score for all missing values distributions
(approximated with 100 samples).
The imputation results, as detailed in the upper part of Table 1,
highlight TSDE’s superior performance over almost all metrics,
outperforming all baselines. Notably, the pretraining-only variant
(i.e., “TSDE”) excels on the PhysioNet dataset, underpinning its ro-
bustness and enhanced generalization capability, even without the
need of any imputation-specific finetuning. For the PM2.5 dataset,
finetuning TSDE (i.e., “TSDE+ft”) yields improved outcomes, likely
attributable to its capability to adapt to the dataset’s structured
missing value patterns. Overall, TSDE’s improvement in CRPS
by 4.2%-6.5% over CSDI, a leading diffusion-based TS imputation
model, signifies a notable advancement in the field. For a qualitative
illustration of imputation results, refer to Figure 2(a).
4.1.2 Interpolation. For interpolation analysis, we utilized the same
PhysioNet dataset [ 70], adopting the processing methods from [ 64,
69,80]. Ground truth scenarios were created by masking all values
at randomly selected timestamps, sampled at rates of 10%, 50% and
90%. TSDE is pretrained for 2,000 epochs, and then further fine-
tuned using an interpolation-only mask for another 200 epochs. In
our benchmarking, TSDE is compared against three TS interpola-
tion methods: (1) Latent ODE [ 64], an RNN-based model leveraging
ODE (ordinary differential equation) for dynamic, continuous and
irregular TS handling; (2) mTANs [ 69], utilizing time embeddings
and attention mechanisms, noted for its strong performance in ir-
regular TS interpolation; and (3) CSDI [ 80] which has also reported
competitive result in interpolation tasks.
The results in the lower section of Table 1 demonstrate TSDE’s
exceptional performance in interpolation, outperforming CSDI by
3.6%-7.0% in CRPS, 5.8%-8.6% in MAE, and 6.1%-17.3% in RMSE.
These findings highlight TSDE’s adeptness in managing irregular
timestamp gaps, a likely factor behind the observation that fine-
tuning does not enhance the pretraining-only TSDE’s performance.Comparatively, while CSDI also operates on a similar diffusion
model backbone, TSDE’s edge lies in its unique embedding learning
ability via IIF masking, adeptly capturing intricate TS characteris-
tics and dynamics for improved results. A qualitative illustration of
interpolation results can be found in Figure 2(b).
4.1.3 Forecasting. We conducted two sets of benchmarking exper-
iments. The first was a benchmarking for probabilistic multivariate
time series forecasting. We employ five real-world datasets: (1)
Electricity, tracking hourly consumption across 370 customers; (2)
Solar, detailing photovoltaic production at 137 Alabama stations; (3)
Taxi, recording half-hourly traffic from 1,214 New York locations;
(4)Traffic, covering hourly occupancy rates of 963 San Francisco
car lanes; and (5) Wiki, monitoring daily views of 2,000 Wikipedia
pages. Adapting the practices from [ 55,66,80], each dataset is con-
verted into a series of multivariate sequences, with 𝐿1historical
timestamps followed by 𝐿2timestamps for forecasting. Training
data apply a rolling window approach with a stride of 1, while
validation and testing data employ a stride of 𝐿2, ensuring distinct,
non-overlapping series for evaluation. Specific 𝐿1and𝐿2values are
outlined in Table 9 in [ 68]. For evaluation metrics, we use CRPS and
MSE, supplemented by CRPS-Sum, as introduced in [ 66]. CRPS-Sum
is computed by summing across different features, capturing the
joint impact of feature distributions. As of benchmarking baselines,
we include several state-of-the-art probabilistic MTS forecasting mod-
els: GP-copula [ 66], TransMAF [ 63] and TLAE [ 55]. Additionally,
in the realm of diffusion-based methods, we include CSDI [ 80] and
TimeGrad [62].
For the second benchmarking, which is a deterministic bench-
marking including recent baselines in the time series library [ 86],
we conducted five experiments for each baseline following the
same setting in [ 86] with history-prediction window lengths of
{8-8, 16-16, 32-32, 96-96, 96-192} on the Electricity dataset. We re-
port the averaged performance in terms of MAE and MSE. We
compared TSDE with the following baselines: TimesNet [ 86], ETS-
former [ 85], LightTS [ 101], DLinear [ 96], FEDformer [ 104], Non-
stationary Transformer [ 43], Autoformer [ 87], Pyraformer [ 41],
Informer [103], Reformer [36], and PatchTST [56].
The forecasting results, as detailed in Table 3, showcase TSDE’s
robust performance, especially when finetuned with a forecasting

mask. Its effectiveness is notable when compared to CSDI, which
is the most closely related method, sharing a diffusion backbone.
TSDE particularly excels in the Electricity, Taxi, and Wiki datasets,
especially as evaluated by the CRPS metric. However, it is important
to note a discrepancy in the Solar dataset performance between
TSDE/CSDI and other baselines, likely due to a data split issue: the
actual test set, per the source code, is identical to the training set,
which contradicts the details reported in the corresponding paper.
Table 2 demonstrates that TSDE outperforms the recent baselines
in terms of average MSE and MAE, highlighting its robustness and
superiority compared to recent methods. The detailed results for
each window length are available in the appendix of [ 68], Table 13.
For a qualitative illustration, refer to Figure 2(c).
4.1.4 Ablation Study. In an ablation study on TSDE across impu-
tation, interpolation, and forecasting, evaluated on PhysioNet (10%
missing ratio) and Electricity datasets, two configurations were
tested: one without crossover, and another without IIF mask (re-
placed by an imputation mask detailed in Algorithm ??). Table 4
underscores the positive contribution of the crossover mechanismacross all three tasks. The impact of IIF masking, while less pro-
nounced for imputation and interpolation, becomes noticeable in
the forecasting task. This can be attributed to the random PhysioNet
missing values, which are distributed fundamentally differently
from a typical forecasting scenario. Thus, IIF strategy is important
for TSDE to gain a generalization ability across various settings.
The contrast between “TSDE” and “TSDE+ft” in Tables 1 and 3 serves
as an ablation study for finetuning; it reveals that pretrained TSDE
can achieve competitive results without the necessity of finetuning.

4.1.5 Inference Efficiency. Similar to CSDI [ 80], TSDE performs
inference by gradual denoising from the last diffusion step 𝑇=50
to the initial step 𝑡=1, to approximate the true data distribution of
missing or future values for imputation/interpolation/forecasting
tasks. Typically, this iterative process can become computationally
expensive. TSDE achieves a substantial acceleration in this process
as illustrated in Table 5, where TSDE is ten times faster than CSDI
under the same experimental setup. This is primarily owing to its
globally shared, efficient dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders
with a crossover mechanism, merely requiring approximately a
quarter of the parameters used by CSDI for MTS encoding.
4.2 Anomaly Detection
For anomaly detection, we adopt an unsupervised approach us-
ing reconstruction error as the anomaly criterion, aligning with
[86,105]. We evaluate TSDE on five benchmark datasets: SMD [ 77],
MSL [ 31], SMAP [ 31], SWaT [ 48] and PSM [ 1]. Once TSDE is pre-
trained, a projection layer, designed to reconstruct MTS from TSDE
embeddings, is finetuned by minimizing MSE reconstruction loss.
Our anomaly detection experiments align with TimesNet [ 105],
utilizing preprocessed datasets from [ 89]. Following their method,
we segment datasets into non-overlapping MTS instances of 100
timestamps each, labeling timestamps as anomalous based on a MSE
threshold. This threshold is set according to the anomaly propor-
tion in the validation dataset, ensuring consistency with baseline
anomaly ratios for a fair comparison.

In this task, TSDE is benchmarked against an extensive set
of baselines featuring diverse backbones, including a) Frozen pre-
trained LLM-based models: GPT4TS [ 105]; b) Task-agnostic founda-
tion models: TimesNet [ 86]; c) MLP (multi-layer perceptron) based
models: LightTS [ 101] and DLinear [ 96]; and finally d) Transformer-
based models: Transformer [ 81], Reformer [ 36], Informer [ 103], Aut-
oformer [ 87], Pyraformer [ 41], LogSparse Transformer [ 38], FED-
former [ 104], Non-stationary Transformer [ 43], ETSformer [ 85],
PatchTST [ 56] and Anomaly Transformer [ 89]. The results in Ta-
ble 6 reveal that TSDE’s anomaly detection performance surpasses
nearly all baselines, with less than a 1% F1 score difference from
GPT4TS. Notably, while TSDE doesn’t outperform GPT4TS, it’s
important to consider that GPT4TS benefits from a pretrained LLM
(GPT-2) with about 1.5 billion model parameters. TSDE, in contrast,
relies on just two single-layer Transformer encoders (<0.3 million
parameters), demonstrating its competitive edge despite having
significantly fewer model parameters.
4.3 Classification
To further inspect the discriminative power of the pretrained TSDE
embedding, we utilize the labeled PhysioNet dataset to evaluate
TSDE’s performance on a binary classification downstream task.This dataset, marked by in-hospital mortality labels for each pa-
tient, features MTS with over 80% missing values. To address this,
we pretrain TSDE for 2,000 epochs to impute the raw MTS. Subse-
quently, we train a simple MLP for 40 epochs to perform mortality
classification. Given the imbalanced nature of PhysioNet labels, we
assess our model’s efficacy with AUROC as in [ 6,24]. We bench-
mark TSDE against a diverse range of established MTS classification
methods, categorized into 3 groups with a total of 12 methods: (1)
heuristic methods: mean/forward imputation [ 24,40], (2) GP/VAE
based models: GP [ 60], VAE [ 35], HI-VAE [ 54], GP-VAE [ 24], and
(3) RNN based models: GRUI-GAN [ 45], GRU-D [ 10], M-RNN [ 94]
and BRITS variants [6].
As shown in Table 7, TSDE surpasses all existing baselines and is
on par with the state-of-the-art BRITS baseline. It is worth noting
that BRITS achieves that performance by employing a sophisticated
multi-task learning mechanism tailored for classification tasks. In
contrast, our method achieves top-tier results by simply finetun-
ing a simple MLP. TSDE’s remarkable performance, especially in
challenging classification scenarios with significant class imbal-
ance (∼10% positive classes), highlights its ability to learn generic
embeddings well-suited for downstream MTS classification tasks.

4.4 Clustering
MTS data often lack annotations, making supervised learning inap-
plicable. In such scenarios, unsupervised clustering is a valuable
method for uncovering intrinsic patterns and classes. We utilize the
same pretrained TSDE model from our classification experiments
(trained on PhysioNet with a 10% missing ratio) to evaluate the
clustering performance of TSDE embeddings. Initially, we generate
MTS embeddings using TSDE’s pretrained embedding function.
For simplicity and visual clarity, these embeddings are projected
into a 2D space using UMAP (uniform manifold approximation
and projection) [ 49]. Subsequently, DBSCAN (density-based spatial
clustering of applications with noise) [ 23] is applied to these 2D
projections to obtain clusters.
ARI=0.010 RI=0.502
(a) Raw MTSARI=0.426 RI=0.737
(b) Embed raw MTSARI=0.302 RI=0.684
(c) Embed imputed MTS
Figure 3: Clustering of (a) raw MTS, (b) TSDE embedding of raw
MTS, and (c) TSDE embedding of TSDE-imputed MTS. Marker shapes
denote ground-truth binary labels; colors indicate DBSCAN [ 23]
clusters after UMAP [49] dimension reduction.
As shown in Figure 3, the clustering quality is assessed across
three data types: (a) raw MTS, (b) TSDE embeddings of raw MTS,
and (c) TSDE embeddings of TSDE-imputed MTS. The ground truth
binary labels are indicated using two distinct marker shapes: circles
and triangles. When using raw MTS as seen in 3(a), the clusters
are unfavourably intertwined, with data points from both classes
intermingling. However, the TSDE embeddings, whether derived
from raw or imputed MTS, exhibit substantially improved cluster
differentiation. These embeddings enable more precise alignment
with ground truth classifications, implying the capability of TSDE
in capturing data nuances. Furthermore, the negligible performance
disparity between Figures 3(b) and 3(c) suggests that TSDE embed-
dings can be directly used for MTS clustering without the need of
imputation. This consistency is likely because our encoders pro-
ficiently encapsulate missing data traits, seamlessly integrating
these subtleties into the embeddings. To provide a quantitative
assessment of clustering, given the presence of labels, we calcu-
late RI (rand index) [ 59] and ARI (adjusted RI) [ 30]. These metrics
are reported on top of each setup in Figure 3. Notably, the RI and
ARI values align with the qualitative observations discussed earlier,
further substantiating our findings.
4.5 Embedding Visualization
To substantiate the representational efficacy of TSDE embeddings,
we undertake a visualization experiment on synthetic MTS data, as
showcased in Figure 4. The data comprises three distinct UTS: (a) a
consistently ascending trend, (b) a cyclical seasonal signal, and (c) a
white noise component. Each UTS embedding has two dimensions
(𝐿×33); for a lucid depiction, we cluster the second dimension bytreating it as 33 samples each of length 𝐿, and visualize the centroid
of these clusters. Intriguingly, the embeddings, which were pre-
trained on the entire synthetic MTS, vividly encapsulate the joint
encoding effects of all series. The trend’s embedding delineates
the series’ progression, evident from the gradual color saturation
changes, embodying the steady evolution. The seasonal signal’s
embedding mirrors its inherent cyclicity, with color oscillations
reflecting its periodic nature. Finally, the noise component’s em-
beddings exhibit sporadic color band patterns (with subtle traces
of seasonal patterns), capturing the inherent randomness.

5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose TSDE, a novel SSL framework for TSRL.
TSDE, the first of its kind, effectively harnesses a diffusion process,
conditioned on an innovative dual-orthogonal Transformer encoder
architecture with a crossover mechanism, and employs a unique
IIF mask strategy. Our comprehensive experiments across diverse
TS analysis tasks, including imputation, interpolation, forecast-
ing, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering, demonstrate
TSDE’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, TSDE shows remarkable results in handling MTS data
with high missing rates and various complexities, thus validating
its effectiveness in capturing the intricate MTS dynamics. Moreover,
TSDE not only significantly accelerates inference speed but also
showcases its versatile embeddings through qualitative visualiza-
tions, encapsulating key MTS characteristics. This positions TSDE
as a robust, efficient, and versatile advancement in MTS representa-
tion learning, suitable for a wide range of MTS tasks. Future work
will focus on several key directions to address the limitation of
slower inference for IIF tasks. Particularly, we will explore simpli-
fying TSDE’s architecture with a simple MLP without the need for
the diffusion block, enabling the pretrained TSDE to execute IIF

In our research, we have included an extensive appendix in the
preprint, which provides supplementary material essential for a
comprehensive understanding of our methodologies and results.
The appendix encompasses detailed descriptions of the datasets,
hyperparameters, and metric formulas used in our evaluations with
their definitions and explanations. These descriptions ensure that
readers can fully grasp the context and settings under which our
experiments were conducted. Additionally, the appendix offers
pseudo-code for the masking strategies employed in imputation,
interpolation, and forecasting tasks, enabling reproducibility and
a deeper understanding of our approach. Furthermore, it provides
architectural details of the projection head for anomaly detection
and the classifier head for classification, highlighting the techni-
cal design choices of applying our TSDE framework to different
downstream tasks.
Moreover, we present additional results for forecasting, compar-
ing TSDE to recent baselines and demonstrating the robustness and
versatility of our proposed TSDE framework across various sce-
narios. The appendix also includes comprehensive documentation
on the implementation aspects, offering insights into the practical
considerations and challenges faced during the development and
evaluation of the TSDE framework. This detailed supplementary
material is crucial for understanding the depth and rigor of the ex-
periments conducted, as well as the significance of our findings. For
a detailed exploration of these methodologies and findings, readers
are encouraged to refer to the full appendix in the preprint [68].
B KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS
This work explored the integration of diffusion models and trans-
former encoders for TSRL. Our results indicate that conditioning
the diffusion model on learned embeddings improves performance
across tasks such as imputation, interpolation, and forecasting. Ad-
ditionally, the embedding block within TSDE proves highly effective
in handling sparse data by leveraging the SSL task of imputing miss-
ing values. The use of IIF masking facilitated the model’s robustness
to sparse data, and handling of different missingness scenarios.
Despite these advancements, the TSDE model has few limita-
tions. The iterative nature of the denoising diffusion probablistic
model can lead to slower inference, presenting a trade-off between
enhanced quality and efficiency in real-world applications. Incor-
porating the SSL pretext task of IIF masking requires additional
training epochs, which can be a constraint for rapid model deploy-
ment and retraining. Furthermore, while TSDE outperforms other
methods, there remains a gap in perfectly matching the ground
truth in highly noisy scenarios. Addressing these limitations will
be crucial for further improving the model’s robustness and appli-
cability.
