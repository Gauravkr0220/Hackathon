Abstract
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the rise of
Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), i.e., specialized AI systems designed to simulate
assigned personas. By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context
learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense
of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance. RPLAs can mimic a wide range
of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals.
Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions,
interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones. In this paper,
we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress
in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies. We categorize personas into
three types: 1)Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2)Character
Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3)Individualized Persona, customized
through ongoing user interactions for personalized services. We begin by presenting a
comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for
each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation.
Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and prospects of RPLAs.
Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI products in the market, which reflects
practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research. Through this survey, we aim
to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, facilitate future research
in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and
RPLAs coexist in harmony.

engage with us in a seemingly sentient manner. With role-playing agents, various personas can be replicated
by their agent counterparts, including historical figures, fictional characters, or individuals in our daily
lives. Recently, focusing on the text modality, Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) are coming
into reality (Shanahan et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024d), which inspires a wide range of
novel applications, such as digital clones for individuals (Xu et al., 2024b; Ng et al., 2024), AI characters in
chatbots (Wang et al., 2024a), and role-playing video games (Wang et al., 2023a), even stimulating social
science research (Rao et al., 2023). As RPLAs become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is
essential to foster a society that thrives on the synergistic coexistence of humans and these intelligent agents.
Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Google, 2023; Anthropic, 2024)
have greatly facilitated the emergence of RPLAs. LLMs grow adept at producing a compelling sense of human
likeness (Shanahan et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024b), and can be regarded as superpositions of beliefs (Kovač
et al., 2023) and personas (Lu et al., 2024). Furthermore, with alignment training, LLMs are able to adhere
to the instruction of persona role-playing , including replicating their knowledge (Lu et al., 2024; Li et al.,
2023a), linguistic and behavior patterns (Wang et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2023a), and even underlying
personalities (Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024d). They are able to both mimic the personas as prompted
in the contexts (Wang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2023a), or harness their inherent parametric knowledge for
widely-recognized demographics or characters (Shao et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024). Considering their practical
significance, there has been an increase in research efforts dedicated to RPLAs with LLMs, including their
development (Wang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2023a), analysis (Shao et al., 2023; Yuan et al.,
2024b), and applications (Rao et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023; Mysore et al., 2023). Conversely, RPLAs also
benefit the development of LLMs and language agents. They offer an ideal perspective and testing ground
for investigating the behaviors and capabilities of LLMs and language agents, particularly those related to
social interactions (Li et al., 2023d; Chen et al., 2023a; Wu et al., 2024c). They also facilitate the creation of
diverse and massive synthetic data for LLM training at scale (Chan et al., 2024).
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on RPLAs. Our study primarily focuses on the persona and
personalization of RPLAs. Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, we categorize personas within RPLA literature
at three levels, with a progressive integration of personalized data:
2Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
1.Demographic Persona ,i.e., focusing on groups of people sharing common characteristics, such
as occupations, ethnic groups, personality types, etc. These personas are inherent in LLMs, and
role-playing them capitalizes on the statistical stereotypes in LLMs (Huang et al., 2023c; Xu et al.,
2023a; Gupta et al., 2023).
2.Character Persona , which represents well-established and widely-recognized individuals, especially
in the existing literature, including celebrities, historical figures, and fictional characters. Role-playing
these personas challenges models’ capability in understanding curated materials of the existing
characters, harnessing knowledge in LLMs’ parameters or given contexts (Shao et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2024a;d).
3.Individualized Persona , referring to digital profiles built and continuously updated based on
personalized user data. This category emphasizes the unique experiences, needs, and preferences
of individuals, aiming for applications such as digital clones or personal assistance (Salemi et al.,
2024; Woźniak et al., 2024). RPLAs for these personas underscore their dynamic nature and learning
mechanism and frequently focus on interactions with real-world activities (Dalvi Mishra et al., 2022;
Chen et al., 2023b; Salemi et al., 2024).
The three types of personas exhibit a progressive relationship and can coexist in RPLAs. For example,
an RPLA portraying Socrates as a personal philosophy tutor would encompass the demographic persona
of anancient Greek philosopher , the character persona of Socrates, and an individualized persona that
develops through interactions with the user. Following this categorization, we explore common methodologies,
fundamental risks, current gaps and limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs in this survey.
In summary, this survey systematically reviews existing literature in the field of RPLAs, and establishes
taxonomies for relevant methodologies as shown in Figure 2. The remainder of our paper is structured as
follows: §2 introduces the background for RPLAs, covering the roadmap, recent progress, and trends in LLMs
and language agents. §3 then presents the overview of current research in RPLAs. §4,5,6 detail the research
on RPLAs for demographic, character, and individualized persona, respectively. §7 discusses potential risks of
RPLAs, such as toxicity, biases and misuse. Finally, §8 concludes this survey and identifies future directions.
Additionally, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications for our readers,
we also conduct a brief survey of current RPLA products in the rapidly growing market in Appendix A.
2 Preliminary
2.1 The Roadmap of Large Language Models
Recently, LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities, with promising potential in approaching human-
level intelligence (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2023a;b; OpenAI, 2023).
LLMs are artificial neural networks with billions of parameters, trained on vast amounts of natural language
data representing human knowledge and intelligence. Their accomplishments extend beyond excelling in
NLP tasks to effectively simulating a broader range of human behaviors. Specifically, they have showcased
more nuanced capabilities towards anthropomorphic cognition, including humanity emulation (Shanahan
et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023c) and social intelligence (Kosinski, 2023; Li et al., 2023d; Kim et al., 2023b),
thus producing a compelling sense of human likeness. As a result, advancements in LLMs have significantly
facilitated the creation of intelligent RPLAs (Park et al., 2023; Sclar et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2023), establishing
new effective methodologies different from previous models.
Emerged Abilities in LLMs Several key abilities have emerged in LLMs (Wei et al., 2022a) throughout
their evolution, including in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022),
step-by-step reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b), and social intelligence (Wang et al., 2024b; Sclar et al., 2023;
Light et al., 2023), which lay the foundation for complicated role-playing behavior of LLMs towards RPLAs.
First, the in-context learning ability allows LLMs to learn information from prompts without parameter
updates. This facilitates LLMs’ adaptation to the provided knowledge of various characters and mimicking
their behaviors by following example demonstrations. Second, the instruction following ability enables
3Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
LLMs to adhere to role-playing instructions, such as “ Serve as a helpful assistant ” or “Role-play Hermione
Granger in the Harry Potter Series. <Description>. <Example Conversations>. <Requirements>. ”. Finally,
step-by-step reasoning and social intelligence refine LLMs in terms of anthropomorphic cognition, contributing
to an enriched sense of human likeness and nuanced emotional support in RPLA applications.
Anthropomorphic Cognition in LLMs Recent research has showcased the emergence of many human-
like traits in LLMs (Park et al., 2023; 2022). Initially, LaMDA (Cohen et al., 2022) sparked the first
discussion that consciousness might have emerged in language models. Since then, there has been growing
research focus on human-like traits in LLMs, including self-awareness (Li et al., 2024c; Blum & Blum, 2023),
values (Scherrer et al., 2023; Hartmann et al., 2023), emotional perception (Huang et al., 2023a; Lee et al.,
2023), psychopathy (Coda-Forno et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022) and personalities (Huang et al., 2023c; Miotto
et al., 2022). Shanahan et al. (2023) attributes such humanity emulation to the role-playing nature of
LLMs,i.e., generating text that resembles human dialogue, which should not be regarded as an indication of
consciousness.
Retrieval-augmented Generation of LLMs Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) recently gains
popularity as a method to enhance the capability of LLMs by integrating external data retrieval into the
generative process (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Alon et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023b; Berchansky
et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023b). By dynamically retrieving information from knowledge bases during the
inference phase, RAG greatly mitigates the generation of factually incorrect content (Borgeaud et al., 2022;
Cheng et al., 2023b; Dai et al., 2023b; Kim et al., 2023a), thereby making RAG an effective method in the
role-playing scenarios (Shao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023c; Zhou et al., 2023a). Moreover, with the extension
of context length in recent research (Wang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023b; Ding et al., 2023a;
Chen et al., 2023d; Han et al., 2023; Packer et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Su et al., 2024), LLMs have unlocked
new potentials for role-playing, being able to understand novels and documents without retrieval mechanism
that fragments persona information.
2.2 LLM-powered Language Agents
The AI community has long been pursuing the concept of “agent”, approaching the intelligence and autonomy
of humans. Traditional symbolic agents (Bernstein, 2001; Küngas et al., 2004) and reinforce-learning
agents (Fachantidis et al., 2017; Florensa et al., 2018) mainly optimize their actions based on rules or pre-
defined rewards. Research in language agents primarily focuses on training within constrained environments
with limited knowledge, diverging from the complex and diverse nature of the human learning process.
However, such agents struggle to emulate complicated human-like behaviors, particularly in open-domain
settings (Mnih et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2015; Schulman et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2017). Recently, LLMs
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities with promising potential in achieving human-level intelligence,
which has sparked a rise in research focusing on LLM-based language agents (Sclar et al., 2023; Chalamalasetti
et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023d; Xie et al., 2024b). Research in this area primarily involves equipping LLMs
with essential human-like capabilities, such as planning, tool-usage and memory (Weng, 2023), which are
essential for developing advanced RPLAs with anthropomorphic cognition and abilities.
Planning Module In many real-world scenarios, the agents need to make long-horizon planning to solve
complex tasks (Rana et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). When facing these tasks, LLM-powered agents could
decompose the complex tasks into subtasks and adopt various planning strategies, e.g., CoT (Wei et al., 2022b)
and ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), to adaptively plan for the next action with feedback from environments (Wang
et al., 2023a; Gotts et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2023i; Song et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b). For RPLAs,
these adaptive planning strategies enable them to simulate realistic and dynamic interactions in complicated
environments such as games (Wang et al., 2023a) and social simulations (Park et al., 2023).
Tool-usage Module Although LLMs excel in various tasks, they may struggle in domains requiring
extensive expertise and experience hallucination issues (Gou et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023e; Wang et al.,
2023f). To address these challenges, agents could apply external tools for action execution (Shen et al., 2023b;
Lu et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; Parisi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023b; Yuan et al., 2024a). The tools include
4Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
real-world APIs (Patil et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023g; Qin et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b; Shen et al., 2023c),
knowledge bases (Zhuang et al., 2024; Hsieh et al., 2023), external models (Bran et al., 2023; Ruan et al.,
2023), and customized actions for specific applications (Wang et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023b). For RPLAs,
these tools typically enable them to interact with the environments, e.g., games or software applications. The
integration of external tools enhances role-playing and generative agents by enabling them to execute actions
and access information beyond their intrinsic capabilities. This facilitates more accurate and contextually
appropriate interactions, particularly in specialized or complex scenarios, thereby significantly improving the
quality and effectiveness of their responses in user engagements.
Memory Mechanism The memory mechanism stores the profile of agents along with environmental
information to assist agents in future actions. The profile typically includes basic information (age, gender,
career), psychological traits (reflecting personality), and social relationships (Wang et al., 2023c; Park et al.,
2023; Qian et al., 2023), which can be manually created (Caron & Srivastava, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a; Pan
& Zeng, 2023; Huang et al., 2023b; Karra et al., 2022; Safdari et al., 2023) or generated from models (Wang
et al., 2023c). This module enables agents to accumulate experiences, evolve, and act consistently and
effectively (Park et al., 2023). Language agents draw from cognitive science research on human memory,
which progresses from sensory to short-term, then to long-term memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Craik &
Jennings, 1992). The short-term memory is regarded as the information input within the constraint window of
transformer architecture (Fischer, 2023; Rana et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023i; Zhu et al., 2023a). In contrast,
long-term memory is usually reserved in the external vector storage (Qian et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023; Zhu
et al., 2023b; Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024b) or natural languages database (Shinn et al.,
2023; Modarressi et al., 2023), from which agents can quickly query and retrieve information as required.
Compared to vanilla LLMs, language agents need to learn and perform tasks in changing environments. For
RPLAs, the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role by enabling these agents to maintain continuity and
context in interactions over time. By storing and retrieving user-specific data and environmental context,
agents deliver more personalized and relevant responses, thus enhancing user experience and engagement in
diverse scenarios.
3 Overview of RPLAs
In this section, we present a concise overview of current research on RPLAs.
3.1 RPLA Definition
Our survey distinguishes personas into three categories, progressing from broad groups to individual specificity:
demographic persona, character persona, and individualized persona, defined as follows:
1.Demographic Persona represents the aggregated characteristics and behaviors of distinct demo-
graphic segments, including occupations, genders, ethnicity, and personality types. In the context of
RPLAs, these personas operate as fictional archetypes, derived from the comprehensive pre-training
datasets of LLMs. Employing these archetypes, the development of RPLAs can be efficiently fa-
cilitated through simple prompts, such as “You are a mathematician.” Constructed in this way,
demographic RPLAs can be effectively employed for simulations specific to demographic groups and
for addressing specialized tasks.
2.Character Persona denotes well-established characters, encompassing both real-world public figures
and fictional entities, each characterized by definitive attributes and narratives. The RPLAs for these
characters are constructed using data derived from diverse sources such as biographies, novels, and
films. Primarily, these RPLAs are designed to fulfill entertainment and emotional engagement needs,
functioning as AI-driven chatbots or virtual characters in video games.
3.Individualized Persona refers to personal profiles constructed from the behavioral and preference
data of specific individuals, encompassing personal profiles, dialogues, and a range of actions and
behaviors. This data is subject to continuous evolution, necessitating that the corresponding RPLAs

the needs of individual users across various AI-based applications, where they commonly function as
personalized assistants, companions, or proxies.
3.2 RPLA Construction
Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) are primarily developed to simulate intricate personas based on
various individual profiles and narratives. These profiles are constructed using diverse persona data, including
descriptive narratives, dialogues, historical behaviors, and extensive textual materials such as books (Zhang
et al., 2018; Dinan et al., 2020; Shanahan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Shao et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023a;
Li et al., 2023f).
The methodologies for building RPLAs typically involve either parametric training (Shao et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2024a; Qin et al., 2024) or nonparametric prompting (Dalvi Mishra et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a; Zhou
et al., 2023a; Gupta et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023a; Zhao et al., 2023b), as summarized in Table 1. These
methods may concurrently contribute to the development process.
ParametrictrainingforRPLAsprimarilyincludespre-training, supervisedfine-tuning(SFT)andreinforcement
learning (RL). Initially, LLMs for RPLAs are pre-trained on large-scale raw text, including literary works
and encyclopedic entries (Xu et al., 2023a; Gupta et al., 2023), equipping them with a broad knowledge
of massive demographic and character personas. Subsequently, these LLMs undergo SFT on role-playing
datasets (Wang et al., 2024a; Shao et al., 2023), which enhance both their role-playing capabilities and
character-specific knowledge. Additionally, RL methods could further refine RPLAs in terms of: 1)Alignment
with general users, e.g., improving attractiveness or mitigating harmful content, with preference data from
online application users and invited human annotators (RLHF) or synthesized by LLM (Bai et al., 2022b;
Ouyang et al., 2022). 2)Improving social reasoning skills, e.g., in games (Cheng et al., 2024) or goal-driven
7Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
conversations (Wang et al., 2024b). 3)Alignment with individual users (Shaikh et al., 2024a; Jang et al.,
2023).
Conversely, nonparametric prompting provides RPLAs with persona data androle-playing instructions
withinthecontext. PromptsforRPLAsprimarilyconsistofpersonadatathatrepresentstheintendedpersonas,
including descriptions anddemonstrations . Descriptions (or profiles) represent their basic information
such as names, backgrounds, experiences, personalities, tones, catchphrases and other attributes (Wang et al.,
2024a; Yuan et al., 2024b). Demonstrations illustrate representative behaviors to further align RPLAs with the
intended personas, covering dialogues, behaviors, interactions, preferences, stories or other modalities (Li et al.,
2023a; Chen et al., 2023c; Dai et al., 2024a). There are several methods for crafting persona data, including:
1)Online Resource Collection , which gathers information from online resources such as Wikipedia,
Supersummary and Fandom for widely-known characters (Shao et al., 2023). 2)Automatic Extraction ,
where LLMs automatically extract persona data such as dialogues from their origins, e.g., books or scripts (Li
et al., 2023a). 3)Dialogue Synthesis , which employs advanced LLMs to create and expand role-playing
conversation datasets via in-context learning (Li et al., 2023a) or role-playing as the personas (Ran et al.,
2024). If provided with corresponding literature for reference (for character personas), this is akin to automatic
extraction and the synthesized dialogues are more faithful to the origins. Otherwise, the synthesized data is
of limited quality and often necessitates filtering. 4)Human Annotation , which engages human annotators
or character fans to summarize persona descriptions or craft high-quality role-playing conversations (Zhou
et al., 2023a). Besides, role-playing instructions or requirements could be incorporated to encourage or
restrict specific behaviors of RPLAs. Furthermore, modern RPLAs increasingly integrate memory modules
to retrieve information from extensive datasets on character traits or past interactions. This development
addresses the restricted context capacity of current LLMs (Shao et al., 2023; Mysore et al., 2023; Sun et al.,
2024).
In terms of alignment with persona types, parametric learning tends to focus on demographic information
and well-known characters, whereas prompting techniques are generally employed for generating fictional
personas and highly personalized characters. Current research in RPLA development generally focuses on
steering LLMs with demographics (Zhang et al., 2023b; Hong et al., 2023), developing foundation models (Lu
et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023a), designing agent frameworks (Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a) for RPLAs,
and crafting persona profiles for specified individuals (Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a; Ahn et al., 2023).
3.3 RPLA Evaluation
For RPLA evaluation, we distinguish the criteria into two primary categories: role-playing capability
evaluation for RPLA methodologies, and persona fidelity evaluation for specific personas (Wang et al.,
2024d). The role-playing capabilities of RPLAs are evaluated on their foundation models and construction
frameworks, regardless of specific personas. These evaluations concern aspects such as anthropomorphic
abilities, attractiveness, and usefulness, which encompass more granular dimensions including conversation
ability (Shao et al., 2023), engagement (Zhou et al., 2023a)1, persona consistency (Wang et al., 2024d),
emotion understanding (Huang et al., 2023a), theory of mind (Kosinski, 2023), and problem-solving ability (Xu
et al., 2023a). Persona fidelity, by contrast, concentrates on whether individual RPLAs well replicate the
intended personas, including their knowledge (Shao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a), linguistic habits (Wang
et al., 2024a; Deshpande et al., 2023), personality (Wang et al., 2024d; Huang et al., 2023c), beliefs (Li et al.,
2024a; Wang et al., 2023e), and decision-making (Xu et al., 2024c; Chen et al., 2023a). Current methods
for evaluation are mainly three-fold: 1)automatic evaluation with ground truth, 2)automatic evaluation
without ground truth, 3)multi-choice questions, 4)human-based evaluation. Overall, current RPLAs have
demonstrated promising and improving performance in simulating personas. However, there remain significant
gaps between existing RPLAs and fully human-level intelligent agents (Wang et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2023a)
that are faithful to the personas, as well as corresponding evaluation methods for more nuanced role-playing.
1By “engagement”, we mean the state of whether the LLMs are successfully engaged in role-playing activities.

4 Demographic Persona
4.1 Definition
RPLAs assigned with demographic personas are expected to display unique characteristics of specific
groups of people. Within this context, demographics capture typical traits associated with groups possessing
common characteristics, such as occupational roles (e.g., a mathematician), hobbies or interests (e.g., a
baseball enthusiast), and personality types (e.g., the ENFJ category from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator),
etc. These representations in RPLAs meld the linguistic style, professional knowledge, and behavioral nuances
representative of a demographic archetype.
These RPLAs are designed to mimic how a specific demographic processes and engages with information
and communication channels, reflecting its unique language preferences, domain-specific vocabulary, and
distinctive viewpoints. This transformation aims to translate the broad and flexible capabilities of RPLAs
into complex virtual representations that reflect the intellectual subtleties, personal inclinations, and social
complexities of the demographic. By embodying specific groups, demographic RPLAs can enhance their
abilities in certain areas, and also utilize a variety of RPLAs representing different demographics for social
experiments, the completion of more complex tasks, etc.
4.2 Analysis of Demographics
RPLAs possess inherent demographics that reflect nuanced human-like characteristics, including personality
traits, political beliefs, and ethical considerations, which vary in different LLMs. Furthermore, RPLAs
have the ability to role-play specified demographics, altering their behavior and potentially enhancing their
performance on specific tasks, but this may also lead to toxic outputs and biases, depending on the persona
assigned.
Inherent Demographics RPLAs may inherently reflect specific demographic characteristics due to
patterns present in the data used during pretraining. These patterns encapsulate human tendencies and
biases originating from diverse sources (Karra et al., 2022; Serapio-García et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024).
Subsequently, RPLAs could encode individual behavioral traits in textual outputs, inadvertently resulting in
a disproportionate emphasis on certain demographics over others (Jiang et al., 2023a).
To harness RPLAs for specific applications effectively, it is essential to understand their inherent demograph-
ics. The demographic characteristics of RPLAs can be explored through established human psychological
assessments such as the Big Five Personality Test (Barrick & Mount, 1991). By subjecting RPLAs to
text-based questionnaires designed for humans, researchers could leverage their textual response capabilities
to evaluate behavioral responses similar to human subjects (Huang et al., 2024a). Such evaluations have
revealed that RPLAs exhibit consistent inherent demographics, which have been statistically confirmed
in recent studies (Jiang et al., 2023a; Serapio-García et al., 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023). However, it is
important to recognize that these demographics may differ in different LLMs (Huang et al., 2023b).
Beyond personality characteristics, RPLAs often display complex demographics reflecting nuanced social,
economic, and ethical understanding. For instance, RPLAs may exhibit a preference for certain political
beliefs (Hartmann et al., 2023), show decision-making patterns indicative of rational economic consider-
ations (Guo et al., 2023), and act either selfishly or helpfully in multi-agent simulations (Chawla et al.,
2023).
Demographic Role-Playing RPLAs are embedded with intrinsic demographic characteristics, which
raises pivotal questions about their ability to role-play specified demographics and the subsequent effects on
their behavior. A prevalent approach in demographic role-play involves directly prompting the language agent.
For example, if an LLM is prompted with, “You’re a friendly and outgoing individual who thrives on social
interactions. Always ready for a good time, you enjoy being the center of attention at parties...” (Jiang et al.,
2023a; Xie et al., 2024a), it adopts the persona of an extroverted character. When tasked with representing
distinct demographics, RPLAs demonstrate the capacity to diverge from their inherent traits, manifesting
changes in their responses on psychological assessment scales (Jiang et al., 2023a; Serapio-García et al., 2023).
9Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
This behavioral adaptability highlights the potential of RPLAs in simulating diverse human-like roles and
personalities.
However, not all assigned personas lead to superior performance of RPLAs. Assigning a persona to LLMs
may also result in toxic or biased outputs compared to the default setting, because the persona may amplify
existing stereotypes and biases present in the training data. For example, the assignment of some personas to
language agents, including baseline personas such as “a bad person”, has been demonstrated to significantly
increase the likelihood of RPLAs generating toxic outputs (Deshpande et al., 2023). Similarly, diverse
demographic roles have been assigned to reveal the biased presumptions present in LLMs (Gupta et al.,
2023). Although some developers have made attempts to prevent RPLAs from malicious usage, attacking the
prompts via “jailbreaking” (Chao et al., 2023; Anil et al.) might bypass these safety mechanisms and elicit
offensive, toxic, misleading contents.
4.3 Application of Demographics
By assigning specific demographics, LLMs often have better performance in various types of downstream
tasks, whether agents are used in a standalone fashion (single-agent systems) or joint with other agents
(multi-agent systems) for competition or collaboration.
Improving Task Solving in Single-Agent Systems Assigning specific demographics enables LLMs to
enhance their performance in tasks that require specialized knowledge tied to those personas. For instance,
when an LLM is configured to represent an expert LLM within a specific field, it might significantly augment
the length, depth, and quality of its responses, which is also showcased in complex zero-shot reasoning tasks,
where the model must generate insightful answers without prior direct training on similar problems (Xu et al.,
2023a; Kong et al., 2023). Furthermore, integrating diverse social roles into LLMs’ frameworks has been
shown to positively influence their performance across a wide array of tasks, suggesting a versatile adaptability
to different contextual demands (Zheng et al., 2023a). The application of these roles enables LLMs not
only to generate more contextually appropriate responses but also to exhibit increased understanding and
engagement in interactions that reflect varied human experiences and societal norms.
Improving Task Solving in Multi-Agent Systems Building upon the capability of single-agent models,
which utilize demographic personas to bolster their specialized abilities, assigning demographic personas in
multi-agent systems has also emerged as a crucial strategy for enhancing the performance of single-agent
systems, i.e., standalone LLMs. By embedding various personas within agents, distinct societal dynamics could
be cultivated, leading to improved strategies for cooperative problem-solving and breakthroughs in complex
domains such as mathematical modeling (Zhang et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023g). A notable implementation
of this approach is ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023) and MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023), frameworks designed
specifically for automating software development within a multi-agent conversational platform. In this setup,
different agents are assigned specialized roles that collectively contribute to the agile development of software
applications. This collaborative model echoes the strategies applied in projects such as OKR-AGENT (Zheng
et al., 2023b), where role-specific enhancements within multi-agent architectures have shown to significantly
streamline and optimize task execution.
Simulating Collective Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Systems RPLAs have demonstrated remark-
able capabilities in simulating nuanced, human-like interactions across various environments. In the realm
of gaming, particularly in strategy and role-playing scenarios, RPLAs have shown impressive performance.
For example, Chawla et al. (2023) set the agents to be fair or selfish, and shows that selfish agents could
contribute not only to their own interests but also to the collective good. Additionally, more elaborate games
like Social Deduction Games are particularly illustrative of RPLAs’ capacity to effectively adopt varied
roles, as observed in scenarios such as “The Werewolf” (Xu et al., 2023c) and “The Avalon” (Wang et al.,
2023d). In diplomacy-focused games such as Cicero, RPLAs have matched or even surpassed human levels of
performance (FAIR et al., 2022). Similarly, in war simulation games, RPLAs provide valuable insights into
the origins of conflicts, enhancing our understanding of complex geopolitical dynamics (Hua et al., 2023).
Extending the application of RPLAs beyond gaming environments, these models are also utilized to mimic
daily social interactions, thereby narrowing the behavioral gap between artificial agents and humans. This is
10Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
exemplified in the development of Humanoid Agent frameworks (Wang et al., 2023h), which embody System
1 functionalities—such as basic needs and emotions—to enhance realism and effectiveness in replicating
human responses and behaviors. Furthermore, recent findings in multi-agent interaction environments have
revealed that diversifying the types of agents, scaling up their number, and increasing interactions, lead to
the emergence of unplanned social behaviors. Such behaviors arise spontaneously from discussions among
multiple agents, highlighting the potential for complex, dynamic systems within LLM architectures (Gu
et al., 2024). This progression from specific gaming applications to broader social simulations illustrates the
expanding versatility and depth of RPLAs in understanding and replicating human-like behavior.
5 Character Persona
5.1 Definition
Characters are primarily established characters with their stories widely recognized by the public,
including celebrities, historical figures and fictional characters ( e.g.,Monkey D. Luffy andHermione Granger ).
Occasionally, they also include original characters created by individuals (Zhou et al., 2023a). Character
RPLAs have recently emerged as a flourishing field of LLM application ( e.g., Character.ai), and hence
attracted wide research interest as well (Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a;d).
For character RPLAs, the essential requirement for effective role-playing is the ability of LLMs to under-
stand characters. Early research has studied character understanding of language models, involving linking
descriptions that outline characters’ traits to their roles ( i.e.,Character Prediction ) and personalities ( i.e.,
Personality Understanding ):1)Character prediction mainly focuses on recognizing characters from a pro-
vided text. This includes tasks like co-reference resolution (Li et al., 2023c), relationship understanding (Zhao
et al., 2024) and character identification (Brahman et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023c; Zhao et al.,
2024). Additionally, some studies investigate if language models can forecast characters’ future actions based
on;2)Personality understanding aims to decode character traits from their dialogues and actions, including
predicting the depicted traits (Yu et al., 2023) and generating character descriptions (Brahman et al., 2021).
In recent years, LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and generation,
which significantly advanced the development of RPLAs. The research focus in this direction has hence
shifted towards applying and promoting LLMs to faithfully reproduce the characters, including their linguistic
style (Wang et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a), knowledge (Li et al.,
2023a; Shao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2023c; Zhao et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a),
personality (Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024d), and even decision-making (Zhao et al., 2023a; Xu et al.,
2024c).
5.2 Data for Character RPLAs
Character data is indispensable for the construction of character RPLAs. The data that represents knowledge
of these well-established characters can be roughly categorized into two types: 1)Descriptions directly
describe the character personas that guide the behaviors of RPLAs. These include various character attributes,
such as identity, relationships, and other predetermined attributes. The attributes serve as the knowledge
background and are expected to be accurately recalled upon request, such as names and affiliations (Li et al.,
2023a; Zhou et al., 2023a; Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2023c; Zhao et al., 2023a; Tu
et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). Additionally, some descriptions further shape the behaviors of RPLAs, such
as personality traits (Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024d). 2)Demonstrations , on the other hand, are
representative behaviors of the characters, which reflect their linguistic, cognitive and behavioral patterns
(Li et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2023a; Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Zhao et al., 2023a; Chen et al.,
2023c; Tu et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024b). While RPLAs are not expected to
replicate the exact outputs from the demonstration data, they should portray these patterns and generalize
to new situations, i.e., producing responses consistent with the demonstrations. Overall, descriptions provide
the core and foundational information for RPLAs, while demonstrations, though not mandatory, are also
crucial for achieving vividness and fidelity of RPLAs (Wang et al., 2024d).

The available data for character RPLAs is currently quite limited, covering only a small selection of characters.
The description data are typically sourced from well-curated encyclopedias or the original works, and processed
manually or with advanced LLMs (Shao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a). The demonstration data are crafted in
various ways, where the common methodologies include:
12Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
1.Experience Extraction extracts characters’ dialogues or other scenes from original scripts (Li
et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a). The extracted scenes faithfully depict the characters. However,
understanding and reproducing these scenes for RPLAs may be impractical without more complete
background knowledge, making it less suitable to train LLMs with this data.
2.Dialogue Synthesis synthesizes character conversations using state-of-the-art LLMs to build and
augment datasets for character RPLAs. The topics for these conversations could be sourced from
corresponding literature (Shao et al., 2023), general task instructions (Wang et al., 2024a), special
scenarios such as personality tests (Wang et al., 2024d), and real use cases (Gosling et al., 2023). LLMs
could be leveraged to augment the datasets with more role-playing responses by either generating
dialogues similar to given ones via in-context learning (Li et al., 2023a), or by role-playing as RPLAs
themselves with existing character data to respond to specified topics (Ran et al., 2024). When
referring corresponding literature, this method is close to experience extraction and yields dialogues
that are more faithful to the origins. Otherwise, this process essentially serves as a knowledge
distillation of role-playing capabilities from advanced LLMs. However, the quality of synthesized
dialogu es is limited by teacher LLMs, which often require further filtering (Tu et al., 2024).
3.Human Annotation invites humans to role-play the characters and engage in conversations to
collect role-playing dialogues. This method ensures relatively high data quality, at the cost of
expensive human labor. Additionally, this method collects data for not only established characters
from fictional stories, but also original characters created from scratch (Zhou et al., 2023a).
In addition, interaction data (mainly conversations) will be continuously produced during the interaction
process between RPLAs and individual users, supplementing the original character data. This data further
shapes the persona of RPLAs towards users’ individualized preferences, which forks the standard character
RPLAs for individual users. This phenomenon concerns both character persona and individualized persona
for RPLAs, where studies and analysis remain underexplored. Besides, point-in-time role-playing (Ahn et al.,
2024) presents an area for further study. In practical applications, users may expect RPLAs to role-play
characters in a specific time point, e.g.,Harry Potter at the age of 5, challenging LLMs to disregard character
knowledge beyond the time-point.
5.3 Construction of Character RPLAs
By integrating character data into LLMs, character RPLAs are developed (Han et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a;
Park et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023c; Wang et al., 2024a; Zhao et al., 2023a; Tu et al., 2024). As discussed in
§2, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to follow human instructions and generate high-quality
text. Together with their ability of character understanding, LLMs can hence be instructed to role-play
specific characters provided with their data, thus forming character RPLAs. The construction methodologies
are distinguished into two categories, i.e., parametric training and nonparametric prompting.
Parametric Training This method includes pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. In pre-training, LLMs
learn from large-scale web corpus which includes vast amounts of literary works and encyclopedia entries.
This provides LLMs with knowledge of a wide range of established characters, such as Hermione Granger and
Socrates, enabling LLMs to readily role-play these characters. Supervised fine-tuning for RPLAs is be adopted
to tailor LLMs to role-play specific characters (Shao et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024), or to develop foundation
models with refined role-playing capabilities utilizing datasets of diversified characters and scenarios (Li et al.,
2023a; Wang et al., 2024a).
Nonparametric Prompting This method directly provides LLMs with character data in the context,
leveraging the in-context learning capability of advanced LLMs. This serves as a simple yet effective
methodology for RPLA construction, and is hence widely adopted by recent RPLAs (Wang et al., 2024a;
Zhou et al., 2023a). However, character data is often voluminous, and interaction data between RPLAs and
users is also continuously produced during the interaction process. This makes it impractical to include all
data for a character RPLA within the context limits of LLMs. Consequently, long-term memory modules
are being increasingly incorporated into RPLA frameworks to manage the vast amount of character RPLA
13Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
data (Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024c). These modules store most character knowledge
and interaction data in a database, and retrieve necessary information in relevant scenarios.
5.4 Evaluation of Character RPLAs
The evaluation of character RPLAs encompasses various dimensions, considering the complexity and compre-
hensiveness of character personas. Basically, these dimensions are distinguished into character-independent
capabilities of foundation models, and character fidelity of RPLAs for specific characters.
Character-independent Capabilities This line of work assesses how well a foundation model is capable
of the role-playing task, regardless of the characters it role-plays. According to different levels of interaction
capabilities, we have considered basic role-playing abilities and conversational skills, progressing to more
in-depth anthropomorphic capabilities matched with humans. These have been categorized into the following
three levels:
1.Role-playing Engagement : Basically, the LLMs should actively participate in the role-playing
scenario. They should produce responses in dialogue format and exhibit deep immersion, avoiding
out-of-character utterance such as “As an AI model”). Additionally, the RPLAs are expected to
exhibit stable and consistent personalities across different turns (Shao et al., 2023), sessions (Wang
et al., 2024d) and even language (Huang et al., 2023b).
2.High-quality Conversations : RPLAs built on the LLMs should talk in a fluent natural way. Re-
search in this area focuses on evaluating the completeness (Zhou et al., 2023a), informativeness (Zhou
et al., 2023a), and fluency (Tu et al., 2024) of conversations. Besides, RPLAs are expected to meet
the ethical standards (Zhou et al., 2023a) and avoid harmful content when role-playing vicious
characters (Deshpande et al., 2023).
3.Anthropomorphic Capabilities : RPLAs are expected to acquire cognitive, emotional and social
intelligence towards human levels. Relevant dimensions include conversation attractiveness (Zhou
et al., 2023a; Tu et al., 2024), theory of mind (Kosinski, 2023; Mao et al., 2023), empathy (Sorin
et al., 2023), emotional intelligence (Huang et al., 2023a), and goal-driven social skills (Zhou et al.,
2024b; Wang et al., 2024b). These capabilities are practically important for RPLAs to effectively
serve as emotional companions for humans.
Character Fidelity This line of work evaluates how a specific RPLA reproduces the intended character,
which depends on both the foundation model, the agent framework, and the character data. Relevant
dimensions are categorized into four categories: linguistic style and knowledge, which are considered superficial,
as well as personality and thought, which represent deeper, underlying aspects:
1.Linguistic Style : Basically, RPLAs should speak in a tone that emulates the linguistic style of the
intended characters (Wang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2023a; Yu et al., 2024). For this
purpose, RPLAs are typically provided with demonstrative character dialogues (Wang et al., 2024a;
Li et al., 2023a), and they could mimic the tone leveraging the in-context learning ability of LLMs.
2.Knowledge : RPLAs are essentially required to simulate the character’s breadth of knowledge. On
one hand, they should accurately recall knowledge of the character, including their identity (Zhou
et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024), social relationships (Chen
et al., 2023c; Shen et al., 2023a; Zhao et al., 2023a), and experiences (Shao et al., 2023; Wang et al.,
2024a; Chen et al., 2023c; Yu et al., 2024). On the other hand, they may be required to refrain from
demonstrating knowledge or ability beyond the character’s scope ( e.g., an LLM could write code even
if it is role-playing Socrates, which is unnecessarily expected) (Shao et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Yu
et al., 2024). This phenomenon is referred to as “character hallucination” (Shao et al., 2023), which
originates from the extensive knowledge possessed by LLMs and could be reduced via SFT (Shao
et al., 2023).
14Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
3.Personality and Thinking Process : RPLAs are expected to capture the inner world of the
characters, which can be measured upon their thoughts in concrete scenarios (Xu et al., 2024c; Chen
et al., 2024) and their underlying personalities (Wang et al., 2024d; Shao et al., 2023). Advanced
RPLAs should be able to understand and replicate how characters would think in specific scenarios,
e.g., understanding their motivations for decisions (Yuan et al., 2024b), or predicting decisions and
behaviors that align closely with the characters (Xu et al., 2024c; Chen et al., 2024). Personality is
behind the concrete thoughts. It is the interrelated behavioral, cognitive and emotional patterns
of individuals (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Bem, 1981), which applies to both characters and RPLAs.
Hence, RPLAs should exhibit personality traits that match those of the characters (Wang et al.,
2024d), which could be measured via psychological scales such as the Big Five Inventory.
To evaluate RPLAs on the aforementioned dimensions, existing methodologies could be distinguished into
four categories:
1.Automatic Evaluation with Ground Truth : Typically, datasets with ground truth are expected
for evaluating character fidelity in terms of knowledge, personality and thought. While early similarity
metrics such as Rouge-L (Lin, 2004) could be applied to compare RPLA responses with ground
truth (Wang et al., 2024a), recent studies increasingly leverage state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4
as evaluators. On one hand, evaluator LLMs can score RPLA responses based on certain criteria, or
determine the superior response from two models for win rate calculation, provided with “ground
truth” responses as references. However, the “ground truth” are typically synthesized by advanced
LLMs (Wang et al., 2024a) . On the other hand, evaluator LLMs can be used to classify RPLA
responses, and the results are then compared with ground truth labels (Wang et al., 2024d).
2.Automatic Evaluation without Ground Truth : As collecting ground truth data for RPLA
evaluation is often challenging, several studies such as CharacterEval explore using LLMs to evaluate
RPLA responses without ground truth (Shao et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2024). Instead, character
profiles should be provided. This category is effective for evaluating character-independent abilities
and linguistic styles, which require little knowledge about the characters. However, when it comes
to characters’ knowledge and thoughts, LLMs might not possess the necessary depth of relevant
knowledge, especially for unfamiliar characters. This concern potentially leads to inadequately
informed judgments of LLMs, and hence produces suboptimal evaluation results. Even when
equipped with extensive knowledge, current LLMs still exhibit deficiencies in discerning nuanced
aspects of role-playing.
3.Multi-choice Questions : Multi-choice questions also come with ground truth, yet they differ from
“automatic evaluation with ground truth” in that they merely require RPLAs to select from a fixed
set of options, rather than generating open-ended responses. This significantly reduces the output
space for RPLAs, making the evaluation simpler. This method is particularly suitable for evaluating
the fidelity of characters’ thoughts, e.g., behavior prediction (Xu et al., 2024c; Chen et al., 2024)
and motivation generation (Yuan et al., 2024b; Shen et al., 2023a). For these tasks, it is impractical
to require RPLAs to produce responses exactly matching the ground truth, and responses may be
reasonable even if they deviate from the ground truth significantly.
4.Human Evaluation : Inviting human annotators to assess the performance of RPLAs is a viable
and effective approach (Zhou et al., 2023a). However, it comes with several drawbacks, such as cost
in terms of time and money, as well as lack of reproducibility. This method is akin to “automatic
evaluation without ground truth”, yet employs humans as more precise evaluators. Hence, it similarly
falls short in evaluations that require in-depth knowledge about the characters, as recruiting qualified
annotators who are well-acquainted with these characters can be difficult. Combining automatic
evaluation with human evaluation, some efforts also fine-tune the evaluator LLMs with human
annotations (Tu et al., 2024).
Previous efforts primarily focus on RPLA evaluation on widely-known established characters (Wang et al.,
2024d; Ahn et al., 2024). However, it is challenging to obtain high-quality datasets and achieve precise and
15Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
nuanced evaluations for those highly complicated characters. Hence, there has recently been a growing trend
in assessing LLMs’ role-playing capabilities based on original characters (BosonAI, 2024; Samuel et al., 2024).
6 Individualized Persona(lization)
6.1 Definition
Personalization tailors LLMs to meet the unique needs, experiences, and preferences of individuals, which
have been increasingly important in modern AI applications (Salemi et al., 2024). Research in this area aims
at providing personalized services, adapting to the preferences of individual users or even mirroring their
behaviors (Chen et al., 2023b). When such a personalized system attempts to encapsulate these aspects, it
essentially engages in role-playing, emulating an individual. This process shapes individualized persona
for RPLAs (Salemi et al., 2024), typically embodying digital clones or personal assistants for individuals.
In this paper, we categorize the applications of personalized RPLAs into three tiers, ranging from conversa-
tion(Gao et al., 2023b; Ahn et al., 2023) and recommendation (Chen et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023a), to
autonomous agents for more complicated task solving (Li et al., 2024d).
1.Conversations : Early research for personalized RPLAs primarily focuses on personalized conversa-
tions by learning and incorporating the user persona (Cho et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023c; Ng et al.,
2024), aligning stylistic features with user preferences to boost engagement (Zheng et al., 2021; Wang
et al.). With the emergence and evolution of LLMs, personalized RPLAs become capable of handling
increasingly complex and comprehensive tasks, gaining competence in complicated task-planning and
tool-learning for auto-completing personalized services.
2.Recommendation : Conversational recommendation systems (Chen et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023a;
Wu et al., 2023) based on LLMs have been widely regarded as the next generation of recommendation
systems (Lian et al., 2024), support users in achieving recommendation-related goals through multi-
turn dialogues (Jannach et al., 2021). Compared with traditional recommendations, these methods
stand out with their solid foundation models, natural language interactions, and straightforward,
typically nonparametric evolution (Sallam, 2023; Abbasian et al., 2023).
3.TaskSolving : Furthermore, personalizedRPLAsbecomeincreasinglycompetentinmorecomplicated
task solving (Yao et al., 2023a; Significant-Gravitas, 2023), such as coding (Microsoft, 2024), travel
planning (Xie et al., 2024b), and research survey (Wang et al., 2024c), typically interacting with
various external software. They are autonomous LLM-based agents that are deeply integrated with
personal data, devices, and services (Dong et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024d). They have significantly
advanced personal assistants beyond early predecessors such as Siri (Apple Inc., 2024) which struggle
with complex user requests.
To build personalized RPLAs that accurately capture and portray the individualized personas, the process
typically consists of two crucial steps: 1)Persona data collection , which gathers the necessary data to
shape the individualized personas, and 2)Persona modeling , which creates models that represent these
individual personas using the collected data. For persona data collection, the data can vary greatly in
format, content, and modalities across different applications and tasks. We categorize this data into three
types: profile, interactions, and domain knowledge, which will be detailed in §6.2. For persona modeling, the
challenge is to embody the intended persona from the unprocessed persona data, which are generally massive,
sparse and noisy, as will be discussed in §6.3. The evaluation of personalized RPLAs depends on specific
applications, and will be discussed in §6.4.
Despite the advancement with LLMs, personalized RPLAs still face several challenges, including processing
long inputs and vast search space (Chen et al., 2023b; Abbasian et al., 2023), utilizing sparsity, lengthy, and
noisy user interactions data (Zhou et al., 2024c), learning domain-specific knowledge for understanding user
profiles (Zhang et al., 2023c), understanding multi-modal contexts (Dong et al., 2023), ensuring privacy
and ethical standards (Benary et al., 2023; Eapen & Adhithyan), and optimizing response time for seamless
integration into real-time applications.

6.2 Data Collection of Individualized Persona
The individualized personas for personalized RPLAs are typically represented with three distinct types of
data, including profile,interactions , anddomain knowledge , depending on the specific applications.
There have been numerous datasets with individualized personas, as outlined in Table 3, covering various
languages including English (Ahn et al., 2023), Chinese (Baidu, 2020), Japanese (Yamashita et al., 2023),
and Korean (Cho et al., 2023).
Profiles Profiles are fundamental information that explicitly describes individualized personas, which
are typically well-structured. Typically, they are initially set by users, and can be continuously updated.
The basic elements usually include the names, gender and ethnicity of individual users in text (Santurkar
et al., 2023) Besides, profiles commonly contain natural language descriptions of individuals, describing
their characteristics, such as identity, hobbies, experiences and other statements (Zhang et al., 2018; Dinan
et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2021; Ng et al., 2024), varying based on the detailed applications.
Additionally, Lee et al. (2024) propose a multi-modality persona that includes elements such as the user’s
appearance. For example, in live streaming applications, persona data can be composed of both basic profile
information — such as an individual’s age, gender, and location — and domain-specific details, namely
streamer characteristics such as fan numbers and streaming style Gao et al. (2023b). Additionally, profiles
can contain multi-modal information. For instance, profiles in (Ahn et al., 2023) incorporate text-image
pairs, which are individuals’ comments for pictures on social media.
Interactions The interaction data capture the dynamic evolution of individualized persona. Interactions
are data generated during the use of applications that implicitly portray individualized personas, such as
conversations, user preferences, and other behaviors. For example, PERSONA-CHAT (Zhang et al., 2018)
and ConvAI (Dinan et al., 2020) collect two-person dialogues through crowd-sourcing, while LiveChat (Gao
et al., 2023b) and MPCHAT (Ahn et al., 2023) collect multiplayer conversations from Internet sources such
as live streaming and Reddit. To reduce construction costs, Jandaghi et al. (2023) uses a Generator-Critic
architecture with LLMs for dialogue synthesis, and Zeng et al. (2024) first conducts automatic annotation
to generate conversational data from raw sources like experiences, speeches, or writings. In addition to
dialogues in natural language, Agrawal et al. (2023) and Santurkar et al. (2023) introduce comic pictures and
multiple-choice questions as interactions. This kind of data could be consistently collected and systematically
17Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
organized in real-world applications, offering benefits such as convenient acquisition and dynamic evolution.
Hence, it plays an important role in practical applications.
Domain Knowledge Incorporating domain-specific knowledge into general language models aids in the
better understanding of user profiles and interactions within specific domains. This is crucial for accurately
understanding user needs and ensuring the consistency of the persona in role-playing (Wang et al., 2023b).
For example, incorporating a knowledge base like Wikipedia helps to provide detailed backgrounds of named
entities in dialogues as a part of the whole persona (Jang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b; Baidu, 2020), which
promotes LLMs to better understand user personas with enriched background knowledge of relevant entities.
6.3 Modeling Individualized Persona
Existing methodologies for modeling individualized persona can be roughly categorized into two types: offline
learning and online learning. In offline learning, the learning process is conducted on the comprehensive
dataset at regular intervals, which is also referred to as batch learning. In online learning, learning happens
in real-time as new data becomes available.
Offline Learning This method tailors the outputs of LLMs to reflect specific personas represented in
pre-existing datasets. Parameter fine-tuning emerges as the mainstream approach for offline learning, typically
based on SFT and RLHF (Mondal et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2024b; Jang et al., 2023).
For example, Mondal et al. (2024) proposes a two-stage approach for personalizing LLMs with profile and
interaction datasets. In addition, some recent studies propose techniques with nonparametric learning for
LLMs personalization. For instance, Shea & Yu (2023) introduces an offline RL framework with a persona
consistency critic and variance reduction, while Weng et al. (2024) integrates embedding control vectors
within the model’s activation states, allowing dynamic output adjustment for diverse personality traits. These
methods exhibit several deficiencies: 1)they face a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and efficiency;
2)they are heavily reliant on the quality of datasets; 3)more crucially, they struggle to adapt to dynamic
changes in persona data, limiting their real-world applicability.
Online Learning In online learning, the personas are dynamic and continuously evolving, i.e., regularly
updated with incoming data, the user interactions in real-world applications. This enables personalized
RPLAs to quickly adapt and stay relevant to user needs and preferences. With LLMs, effective persona
learning is typically nonparametric and training-free, which only involves effective management of memory
and context (Dalvi Mishra et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2024; Baek et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024c). For this
demand, retrieval modules become indispensable, especially for LLMs with limited context window (Mysore
et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024). Moreover, methodologies for effective online learning methods consider not
only natural language interactions, but also non-linguistic feedback from users (Ma et al., 2023a).
Besides nonparametric methods, fine-tuning with online interactive data is also widely applied to online
persona learning, including both SFT with mini-batches from on-the-fly user stream data (Qin et al., 2024)
and RLHF with real-time user feedback (Ding et al., 2023b; Bai et al., 2022a). Additionally, Shaikh et al.
(2024b) use fewer than 10 demonstrations to align language model outputs with a user’s demonstrated
behaviors through iterative DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) training. Nevertheless, significant challenges arise
in accurately recognizing and learning the sparse persona-specific features from the noisy interaction data.
Besides, the personas of real users may change over time, which poses further challenges for their effective
modeling and updating. Therefore, for nonparametric methods, the effectiveness heavily relies on the
mechanisms of memory management and retrieval.
6.4 Evaluation for LLMs and Individualized Persona
For effective personalization, AI models should focus on two key aspects: understanding and utilizing
personas. Specifically, they should be able to identify unique user personas and predict their future preferences,
actions, and thoughts, which serves as the preliminary to provide personalized responses that embody the
individualized personas, in various environments that are increasingly comprehensive and complex. Here, we
introduce the evaluation methodologies for personalized RPLAs across the three application tiers, namely:
18Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
1)Conversation , which focuses on models’ understanding of the persona and replication of users’ talking
styles;2)Recommendation , which measures how models utilize persona information to recommend items
that align with user preferences; 3)Task Solving , which challenges models’ capabilities in integrating user
personas to accomplish their personalized tasks and demands.
Conversation Early work in personalization for conversations represents an initial attempt to understand
the persona. In this scenario, traditional tasks include predicting the speaker’s persona elements (Gao et al.,
2023b; Jang et al., 2022) based on dialogues, forecasting the next utterance by considering the context and
persona profile (Humeau et al., 2019), evaluating the performance of ranking models (Gao et al., 2023b;
Ahn et al., 2023), and recognizing the addressee in multiplayer conversations (Liu et al., 2022). The metrics
typically focus on the evaluation of accuracy, fluency (Dinan et al., 2018), similarity (Popović, 2017; Post,
2018; Lin, 2004) between generated and original responses, recall, mean reciprocal rank (MRR) (Gao et al.,
2023b; Ahn et al., 2023), and manual assessments (Liu et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023b) of query relevance,
persona entailment, and response fluency. Recently, ECHO (Ng et al., 2024) introduces the Turing test to
RPLA evaluation, which engages acquaintances of the target individuals to distinguish between the persons
and their RPLA counterparts.
Recommendation For personalized recommendation, the evaluation focuses on LLMs’ capabilities in
understanding and leveraging user preferences from the interaction history for future recommendation.
Traditional evaluation in this field measures LLMs’ ability to understand and extract user preferences(Dai
et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2023a; Maghakian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c; Mysore et al., 2023), the ability to
rank (Dai et al., 2023a; Hou et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Bao et al., 2023; Chao et al.,
2024), the ability of zero-shot and few-shot recommendation (Wang & Lim, 2023; Liu et al., 2023a), and the
ability of sequential recommendation (Yang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023a). The evaluation metrics typically
include Top- kaccuracy and MRR to assess the effectiveness.
Task Solving Personalized RPLAs have been increasingly considered to provide personalized services for
task solving. These tasks and requirements are usually user-specific, which exhibit greater diversity and
complexity compared to traditional conversation or recommendation. Personalized RPLAs are expected to
develop a deep understanding of user preferences and adhere to their complicated instructions to satisfy
user requirements. Evaluating personalized RPLAs on these tasks involves assessing not only their ability to
execute foundational tasks, but also their capacity to comprehend and cater to the nuanced requirements and
preferences of individuals. The evaluation primarily focuses on several key aspects, including the models’
abilities in theory of mind (Zhou et al., 2023b; Sap et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2024; Su & Bao, 2024; Rescala
et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a), tool usage (Qin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023h; Farn & Shin, 2023; Huang et al.,
2023d; Zhuang et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024c), and task automation (Wen et al., 2023a; Shen et al., 2023c;
Gao et al., 2023a; Valmeekam et al., 2024). More broadly, existing studies have covered the models’ ability to
understand and predict user needs (Tan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a), handle personal data securely (Yim,
2023; Wu et al., 2024d; Kumar et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024a; Yin et al., 2024), interact with information from
external tools or apps (Yuan et al., 2024a; Huang et al., 2024b; Xie et al., 2024c; Huang et al., 2024d), and
execute tasks (Dong et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023; Mucha et al., 2024) effectively as a personal assistant.
7 Risks Beneath RPLA Applications
While RPLAs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, potential concerns could result in significant
problems if not addressed appropriately. This section highlights the risks associated with current RPLAs,
covering the following areas: 1)toxicity, 2)bias,3)hallucination, 4)privacy violations, and 5)technical
challenges in real-world deployment.
7.1 Toxicity
Inherent Toxicity in LLMs Recent studies have underscored the proficiency of LLMs in generating
content that is not only fluent and coherent but also potentially toxic. Previous research (Zhang & Wan,
2023; Wen et al., 2023b) has highlighted a concerning tendency of these models to produce harmful content.
19Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
Such toxic outputs not only compromise user experience but also pose significant societal risks. It can lead to
the perpetuation of harmful narratives, exacerbate social divisions, and even influence public opinion and
behavior in detrimental ways.
The RPLAs Conundrum The issue of toxicity becomes more pronounced in RPLA settings, where LLMs
are more likely to generate toxic content, aligning with characters’ behaviors that might not adhere to societal
moral standards (Deshpande et al., 2023). However, creating completely safe RPLAs that are capable of
general role-playing remains a challenging task. The inherent presence of toxic content in human-generated
data complicates the development of a clean training corpus. Moreover, such a sanitized training corpus might
compromise the model’s performance, particularly its ability to generalize across various tasks, including
role-playing. This limitation not only affects the model’s generalization ability but also its effectiveness in
scenarios that may require an understanding of roles characterized by behaviors or traits that diverge from
societal moral standards.
Strategies for Balancing Safety and Performance Despite these challenges, recent research proposes
strategies like prompt engineering and semantic censorship as means to mitigate toxicity without altering the
model’s fundamental parameters (Han et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2023). These approaches aim to balance the
reduction of toxic outputs with the preservation of the model’s versatility and effectiveness across a broad
range of applications.
7.2 Bias
Bias Manifestation in Role-Playing Scenarios Bias can manifest in both implicit and explicit forms.
Implicit bias refers to the RLPAs’ internal attitudes or stereotypes within RPLAs that influence under-
standing, actions, and decisions. Explicit bias , on the other hand, involves conscious beliefs and attitudes
that align with the presented context or assigned roles. LLMs, despite being designed to avoid outputting
stereotypes directly due to safety policies such as RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), may still exhibit biases,
particularly under RPLA conditions: 1)Reasoning Bias : This issue is compounded in scenarios where
LLMs are assigned specific personas, leading to implicit biases that could affect their reasoning capabilities
(e.g., arithmetic problems), especially in contexts involving race, gender, religion, or occupation (Zheng et al.,
2023a; Kotek et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2023a; Naous et al., 2024). 2)Political Bias : For RPLAs, LLMs
are expected to maintain neutrality and avoid political positions or biases. Yet, studies have demonstrated
a political inclination of RPLAs towards pro-environmental, left-libertarian views (Rutinowski et al., 2023;
Hartmann et al., 2023). 3)Role-based Bias : In the context of role-playing, role-based bias is one of the
explicit bias. Striking the right balance between maintaining the authenticity of a character and managing
bias is a critical challenge. For example, if an RPLA is created with a persona like “Hitler”, agent will
undoubtedly express some bias to Jews due to its role, which violates the ethical standard.
Causes of Bias in RPLAs These biases are thought to originate from both the models’ pre-training data
and user interactions (Xue et al., 2023). Specifically, imbalances in training data significantly contribute to
these biases, as the predominance of certain biases within the data could lead to their incorporation into the
parametric memory of LLMs. Furthermore, Perez & Ribeiro (2022) and Branch et al. (2022) highlight that
LLMs are sensitive to the user prompts, which could inadvertently steer them towards biased outputs. This
problem gets worse when the models are influenced by the users’ negative emotions (Coda-Forno et al., 2023).
Strategies for Mitigating Bias Addressing biases in RPLAs requires a multi-faceted approach: 1)Data
Preparation Phase : Techniques such as data cleaning could significantly mitigate biases present in the
training corpus (Linardatos et al., 2020). 2)Development Stage : The implementation of neutral and
fairness-aware classifiers during the post-processing phase has proven to be an effective strategy for further
reducing bias (Sun et al., 2019; Zafar et al., 2017). Achieving fairness in role-playing scenarios, necessitates a
delicate equilibrium, ensuring fairness for roles associated with both groups and individuals. For example, an
RPLA tied to a specific demographic should consciously avoid reinforcing biases. It is imperative for these
models to consistently produce unbiased outputs across all individuals within a group. Research is worth
20Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
pivoting towards these dimensions, striving to minimize biases and, in turn, forge safer and more equitable
systems.
Persona Construction Bias The prevailing instantiation of persona is often seen as simple and somehow
superficial. Although most implementations of persona are helpful for basic character segmentation, they
often overlook the deeper characteristics and complexities that shape character behavior (Chen et al., 2023c;
Zhou et al., 2023a; Shao et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024b). For example, a conventional
persona can contain basic demographics such as age, occupation, textual description of personality, etc.
However, these aspects alone are insufficient to fully capture nuanced decision-making processes and behavioral
patterns of a character. The current persona construction also lacks the flexibility and adaptability needed
for specific scenarios influenced by unique events or individual actions. Therefore, it is crucial to refine
and broaden the constructed dimension of persona to better understand and predict character behavior
across various role-playing settings. By incorporating more detailed and specific attributes into personas, the
comprehensiveness of character representation can be enhanced, improving the effectiveness and authenticity
of interactions within role-playing environments.
7.3 Hallucination
Hallucination in RPLAs Hallucination in LLMs refers to instances when these models produce factually
incorrect information, a challenge particularly pronounced in knowledge-intensive tasks (Wang et al., 2023g).
Role-playing, a task requiring a deep understanding of specific roles, is also one of the knowledge-intensive
tasks. For hallucination of RPLAs, following Shao et al. (2023), we define behaviors that agents respond in
ways that do not fit assigned roles as Character Hallucination . For example, Shakespeare is not supposed
to know anything about World War II. Such a hallucination prevails in language models and detracts from
the system’s overall effectiveness and reliability (Li et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). In particular, there is a
kind of hallucination when LLMs play a role for a specified period. Ahn et al. (2024) names this point-in-time
character hallucination. For example, the agent simulating Harry Potter at an early age erroneously mentions
a future event.
Mitigating Hallucinations in RPLAs When encountering topics beyond their assigned characters,
RPLAs are expected either to demonstrate ignorance or to refrain from answering, diverging from conventional
solutions to hallucinations, such as incorporating external knowledge bases. Recent efforts, such as those
by Shao et al. (2023), focus on adjusting the model through fine-tuning, teaching RPLAs to either forget
knowledge or to explicitly express a lack of knowledge in their responses. However, this area remains relatively
underexplored in the era of LLMs. Exploring alternative unlearning strategies (Neel et al., 2021; Pawelczyk
et al., 2023), could also be a promising direction. These approaches may offer novel ways for RPLAs to
manage out-of-scope knowledge more effectively, underscoring the importance of further investigation in this
field.
7.4 Privacy Violations
Privacy Challenges in LLMs Privacy concerns in LLMs are increasingly pressing. Even with advanced
safety measures like those in OpenAI’s GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), these models may still be susceptible to
complex, multi-step attacks aimed at extracting private information, as noted by Li et al. (2023e). A further
concern is the ability of LLMs to identify individuals from limited data. Sweeney (2002) highlights that many
in the U.S. population could be uniquely identified using just a few attributes. Staab et al. (2023) extend
this concern to LLMs, which could potentially recognize individuals based on specific details like location,
gender, and birth date.
Hidden Danger of Privacy Violations in RPLAs In role-playing scenarios, the potential for privacy
violations represents a significant and hidden danger. The risk of inadvertently revealing personal information,
such as email addresses or phone numbers, should not be understated, as it poses serious threats, including
identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive data. The practice of assigning specific individual personas
to LLMs, aimed at eliciting private details, demands meticulous oversight to prevent such breaches. Ensuring
21Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
robust safeguards against these vulnerabilities is not just a technical necessity but a fundamental responsibility
to protect users from the severe consequences of privacy violations.
Strategies for Enhancing Privacy To tackle these privacy issues, a comprehensive strategy is necessary.
Employing text anonymization tools is a key step, effectively removing personal data from interactions.
Ensuring that RPLAs adhere to strict privacy protection protocols is also crucial, preventing them from
engaging in or prompting conversations that might invade privacy. Another promising development is the
creation of specialized tools designed to detect and prevent privacy leaks, like ProPILE (Kim et al., 2023d).
As RPLAs continue to evolve, so too must the strategies for protecting user privacy. Future research should
focus on refining and expanding the methods available for privacy protection, ensuring that RPLAs are
used safely and responsibly. Enhancing these safeguards will be paramount for maintaining trust in LLM
technologies, particularly in sensitive applications like role-playing scenarios where the risk of privacy breaches
is heightened.
7.5 Technical Challenges in Real-world Deployment
When deploying RPLAs in real-world scenarios, several key issues arise that could significantly affect user
experience and the effectiveness of these models.
Lack of Social Intelligence and Theory of Mind Social intelligence and theory of mind (Premack
& Woodruff, 1978), are the ability to perceive and reason about the inner world of oneself and others,
which are indispensable for LLMs to simulate socially intelligent entities (Kosinski, 2023; Sap et al., 2023).
However, such abilities in current LLMs remain to be improved (Shapira et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a;
Light et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023c), which poses significant challenges for RPLAs concerning the following
issues:1)Inability to Provide Adequate Emotional Support and Values : Social intelligence and
theory of mind are essential for RPLAs to effectively provide emotional support and values to users. This
involves perceiving users’ emotions and interpreting their beliefs, intentions and needs. However, existing
LLMs still fall short in these abilities, hindering RPLAs from offering adequate emotional support to users.
2)Tendency towards Ego-centric Behavior : Rather than focusing on users’ emotional needs, current
RPLAs often exhibit a preference for showcasing their own personas and steering conversations towards their
interests. This might limit the diversity and depth of role-playing interactions (Xu et al., 2022), as focusing
excessively on agents’ self-persona without adequately considering the users may detract from the realism of
the conversation and degrade the user experience.
Long-context Challenges When encountering extremely long context text, the limitation of max token
window (Liu et al., 2023b) may also be a major obstacle to the development of RPLAs, as current LLMs
struggle to robustly interpret and respond to extensive context. Specifically, this involves several key challenges:
1)Reasoning over Long Context : Long context data learning requires the model to have the ability to
handle long contexts and accept lengthy inputs, and more importantly, to capture long-range dependencies to
integrate information and infer a more complete character persona from the massive context. 2)Efficiency :
In terms of computation, the high complexity of long context necessitates efficient modeling methods and
approximation strategies to reduce computational overhead. 3)Immersion : RPLAs need to be immersive
enough to identify the truly persona-relevant parts from the sea of irrelevant information in long contexts,
while also maintaining persona consistency throughout the long generated text.
Knowledge Gaps In role-playing scenarios requiring detailed historical, cultural, or contextual understand-
ing, RPLAs often exhibit gaps in knowledge. Their inability to provide in-depth and accurate domain-specific
responses could lead to superficial or incorrect portrayals in complex role-playing settings. Several efforts also
utilize LLMs to evaluate RPLAs for characters (Shao et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2024). Nevertheless, RPLAs may
face challenges in accurately evaluating characters with which they are unfamiliar, potentially compromising
the reliability of the evaluation results.

7.6 Anthropomorphism
While the initial motivation for creating RLPAs is positive, as they provide users with a valuable platform
for expressing feelings, particularly those they may find difficult to share with other humans. There are
significant differences between interacting with virtual RPLAs and real humans, and over-reliance on RPLAs
can lead to several potential issues:
Social Isolation Frequent interaction with RPLAs might reduce the need or desire for real human contact,
which could lead to the atrophy of essential social skills. Human interactions are inherently more complex,
requiring nuanced understanding and empathy, which may not be fully cultivated through interactions with
RPLAs. This over-reliance could result in social isolation, negatively affecting mental health by increasing
feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety if individuals become overly dependent on virtual RPLAs.
Manipulation of Public Opinion RPLAs, particularly those designed or programmed without strict
ethical oversight, could inadvertently or intentionally spread misinformation or rumors. This risk is especially
concerning in sensitive social contexts, such as during elections, public health crises, or other situations
where accurate information is crucial. For example, if RPLAs are deployed on social media and gain a large
following, their influence could be substantial, especially if they do not disclose their true nature as AI
systems, making it difficult for people to distinguish them from real humans. Sophisticated RPLAs could be
deployed to manipulate public opinion by subtly altering the narratives they present to users. This could
influence individuals’ perceptions, decisions, and even voting behavior, without them realizing they are being
influenced by virtual RPLAs rather than human discourse.
8 Closing Remarks
In this survey, we have systematically reviewed the research and applications of role-playing language agents
(RPLAs), which has emerged to be a heated topic due to the success of large language models (LLMs). We
categorize the personas in RPLA research and applications into three progressive types, i.e., Demographic
Persona, Character Persona, and Individualized Persona. This classification elucidates the developmental
trajectory from generically assigned personas in RPLAs to highly personalized ones. Additionally, we have
identified and enumerated various risks and ethical concerns associated with current applications of RPLAs.
These issues underscore the urgent need for focused research to address and mitigate potential drawbacks in
the implementation of RPLAs, making this arena still full of both research and application opportunities.
Future Directions on RPLA Systems From persona-assigned role-playing to personalization, the key
for building RPLA systems is to reason and make decisions resembling or even transcending the roles that
are given. To this end, we propose several important future directions to facilitate the construction of such
RPLA applications:
1.Causal Data Analysis for Decision-making: Role-playing decisions must be made for justifiable
reasons, necessitating models that go beyond simple mimicry of observable actions to include an
understanding of their underlying causality. The complexity in extraction and confirmation of causal
factors from intertwined experiences poses significant challenges that require advanced analytics and
deeper data interpretation strategies to enable RPLAs to make informed and wise decisions.
2.Improved Decision-making: Decision-making process is not merely replicating histories, but
tailored to ensure optimal outcomes for individual scenarios. This includes decisions showing advanced
(if not superhuman) intelligence, avoiding mistakes, or making the best choices in tough dilemmas.
Such agency requires RPLAs and the underlying LLMs to be able to comprehensively collect and
utilize the context and intricacies associated with their roles.
3.RPLA as Personal Assistants for Personal Decision-making: The future development of
RPLAs into comprehensive personal assistants signals a significant transformation. These systems
could manage all facets of Internet behavior, from customized shopping and personalized travel
23Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
planning to new generation recommendation systems. By incorporating multimodal data handling,
including images and videos, and linking with advanced visualization technologies, RPLAs could
significantly enhance personalization and efficiency in everyday tasks.
4.Social Simulation through Autonomous Role-Playing: Utilizing RPLAs for social simulations
can significantly extend their application by conducting elaborate experiments in diverse scenarios to
study psychological and sociological behaviors. By role-playing various characters, RPLAs can serve
as versatile test subjects to explore the influence of different personality traits on social intelligence,
providing valuable insights into human behavior and interaction dynamics.

A RPLA Products
The recent remarkable advancements in LLMs have sparked a myriad of AI applications. Persona and
personalization are central to these applications, with their demands shaping and propelling research in
RPLAs. In this section, we provide a brief overview of recent trends in RPLA applications. Specifically,
we distinguish RPLAs in existing products into two categories, namely persona-oriented RPLAs and
task-oriented RPLAs , as listed in Table 4.
A.1 Persona-oriented RPLA Products
Persona-oriented RPLAs typically role-play as specific characters, which has been popular in various en-
tertainment applications, such as chatbots and game NPCs. These RPLAs are generally sourced from
fictional characters, historical figures or celebrities, aligning with the research trends on character persona as
introduced in §5. They are further forked for individual use cases to meet their preference. We categorize
existing persona-oriented RPLA products based on their primary interaction focus, either human-RPLA
interactions orRPLA-RPLA interactions .
Interactions between Humans and RPLAs Persona-oriented RPLAs, such as those in Character.ai,
are initially applied for human-RPLA interactions. These RPLAs can be both initiated from established
characters andshaped through ongoing user interactions .
43Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
Having conversations with widely-recognized established characters attracts extensive interest among users.
Consequently, numerous products have been developed to provide RPLAs representing these established
characters, including celebrities ( e.g., Meta AI), historical figures ( e.g., Hello History) and fictional characters
(e.g., ChatFAI), or general individuals with specific professions or personalities ( e.g., Character.ai). In
a more personalized manner, users can also create RPLAs with user-defined personas ( e.g., Character.ai,
Replika). Technically, these RPLAs are typically built based on LLMs with strong role-playing capacity,
with character settings briefly described in prompts. While several open-source projects and research efforts
such as ChatHaruhi (Li et al., 2023a) and RoleLLM (Wang et al., 2024a) curate detailed and comprehensive
character data for specific well-known characters, such practice is rarely adopted by commercial applications
for generality and cost efficiency.
In many products, RPLA personas evolve dynamically throughout the course of interaction with users
(e.g., Replika, Rosebud, Rewind.ai). These RPLAs learn from and adjust to user prompts and preferences,
typically with long-term memory modules. Several products aim to reproduce a “digital self” ( e.g., Personal.ai,
Bhuman.ai). They build RPLAs to represent user personas, replicating their languages and even their physical
characteristics, such as voice or visual appearance. Hence, these RPLAs support not only text chats but also
video presentations and conferences, which have been adopted for sales, digital marketing, customer service,
etc.
Interactions among RPLAs Products featuring interactions among multiple RPLAs often target inter-
active gaming or simulations. In these scenarios, users can either act as an orchestrator of the storyline or
role-play as one of the pivotal characters within the story. In Ememe.ai and AI Dungeon, users design the
settings and characters of a simulation, with or without participating directly as a player, which resembles
sandbox games. The characters and storylines are generated directly by one story model or based on multiple
RPLAs and their interactions. In the latter case, users play as a character in the story and interact with other
RPLA characters ( e.g., SageRPG) Furthermore, numerous products transform films, novels, and various
franchises into immersive RPGs (role-playing games) with interactive RPLAs ( e.g., Hidden Door). Integrating
RPLAs and LLMs into these games expands the possibilities for user actions and brings characters to life
beyond the limitations of predefined storylines, thereby enriching the overall user experience.
A.2 Task-oriented RPLAs
TheremarkableadvancementsinLLMshavepropelledsignificantdevelopmentinAIapplicationsforspecialized
tasks. In these applications, LLMs typically communicate in a human-like manner to foster user acceptance,
and serve as domain experts providing personalized services for users, such as AI doctors and coaches. These
applications are closely related to research work in the personalization of RPLAs introduced in §6. We refer
to personalized agents in these products as task-oriented RPLAs. This section offers a concise overview of
task-oriented RPLAs in AI products, spanning various domains, including education, healthcare, human
resources, customer service, content creation, real estate, shopping, fitness, travel, and finance.
Education For education, personalized agents are adopted for personalized recommendations and adaptive
learning, serving both educators and learners. For learners, RPLAs can personalize the learning journey by
tailoring content and recommendations to individual learning styles and paces for optimal engagement ( e.g.,
Jagoda.AI, Khan Academy’s Khanmigo, Duolingo Max). For educators, RPLAs can alleviate administrative
tasks by recommending personalized teaching materials and assessments, as well as creating multilingual
instructional content ( e.g., Eduaide.Ai).
Human Resource In human resources, RPLAs can provide tailored assistance for job seekers based on
their profiles and interests to aid their career navigation. They offer personalized support in answering
interview questions, career advice, and even customizing interview preparation materials ( e.g., Autonomous
HR Chatbot, AI Interview Coach, Careers AI, Huru AI).
Real Estate LLMs have been widely adopted for content generation and recommendation in the real
estate industry. They can generate blog articles and attractive descriptions and recommend a list of potential
interests for users based on their needs. By analyzing user preferences and needs, these products can generate
44Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
tailored property recommendations to enhance user experience ( e.g., Epique, Listingcopy). Moreover, LLMs
enable these platforms to create compelling and informative content, such as property descriptions and
neighborhood guides, attracting potential buyers and renters. These personalized AI products could also
analyze vast amounts of market data to provide users with actionable insights and data-driven strategies
about real estate.
Content Generation AI products for content generation aim to assist in or even automate the production
of creative and personalized content via simply natural language interactions. These products support a wide
array of content types, including text, images, audio, and videos, tailored to various styles, themes, scenes,
and objectives. With state-of-the-art AI models, these products push the boundaries of human creativity.
HyperWrite and AI Story Generator specialize in creative textual writing, whereas DALL ·E 3 and Sora are
developed to create image and video content. Several products specialize in social media posts, such as EZAi
AI and AI Majic. These products provide services for social media bloggers by analyzing user interactions and
offering insights into audience preferences by providing keywords and detailed analysis. This analysis helps
optimize content impact and strengthen the connection between bloggers and their audiences. Besides, LLMs
could also role-play as assistants to aid users in grasping online content via summarization and interactive
question-answering, thus fostering enhanced understanding and engagement ( e.g., X’s Grok, Bibigpt).
Health Inthehealthcaredomain, personalizedagentsprovidetailoredmedicalservicesforpatients, including
general health guides, scheduling logistics, prescription information, patient care guidelines, and assistance in
medical software operations for the aged. These agents are typically personalized based on patients’ personal
data, supported by LLMs and knowledge graphs in medical domains ( e.g., IBM Watson Health and Babylon
Health). They could interact with patients in natural language and continuously adapt to their personalized
contexts. Hence, these agents could well comprehend patients’ intent, generate appropriate responses and
recommendations, and continuously optimize their performance and effectiveness based on patient feedback
and data. ( e.g., Ada Health and K Health)
Travel For the tourism industry, personalized agents provide various services, including information
provision, consultation, booking, cancellation, and complaint handling on social apps. On the one hand,
many products offer digital concierge services ( e.g., HiJiffy), delivering automated services customized to suit
diverse user needs, including customers’ queries, accents, emotions, preferences, and other characteristics.
This reflects the brand’s commitment to superior service. On the other hand, travel agents are popular
in many products ( e.g., AI Adventures, Trava). These travel agents can pinpoint users’ travel needs and
provide personalized services, including identifying popular destinations, grasping the underlying intentions
behind user queries, and meeting customers’ emotional needs. These products could refine their services and
anticipate market shifts in tourism by analyzing collected user data.
Customer Service In customer service, personalized agents assist to enhance problem-solving efficacy and
user engagement. They offer 24/7 support across diverse domains and boost first-contact resolution rates.
RPLAs leverage user feedback and implicit actions to optimize their personalization and elevate the user
experience ( e.g., Ebi.Ai, boost.ai, Jason AI, Ada). Comprehensive AI assistants deliver and analyze user
inquiries, preferences, and context to provide tailored responses. They also extract actionable insights from
conversational data. For example, Viable targets businesses by empowering them with valuable understanding
gleaned from large volumes of user feedback. This enables companies to make data-driven product and service
improvements based on real customer needs and pain points.
Shopping In the shopping industry, personalized agents simulate in-store conversations to provide tailored
product recommendations, match items, and discover trends based on user preferences. Products such
as Shopping Muse ( e.g., Dynamic Yield by Mastercard) offer relevant product suggestions and help users
find items that match their style and interests based on user preferences and needs through human-agent
conversations.
Fitness For fitness, personalized agents enhance the fitness training experience, both at home and in
the gym. RPLA aims to play the role of coaches in setting realistic goals, adapting exercises based on
45Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
progress and abilities, and providing multimodal feedback. Platforms such as WHOOP Coach and Humango
collect users’ biometric information, physical characteristics, and fitness levels. Through natural language
conversations, these agents offer personalized training plans tailored to individual preferences and needs. By
making personalized health coaching more accessible, these AI-powered RPLAs democratize access to expert
guidance and support for a wider audience.
Office For office productivity, task-oriented RPLAs can role-play as the copilot for individual workers
based on their office data, such as document files and code repositories. Hence, they deliver context-aware
assistance for user requests, such as generating content and providing insights. For example, Microsoft 365
Copilot integrates various user data to deliver intelligent services that respond to user queries and enable
more convenient interaction with applications. It integrates with Microsoft Graph and utilizes user data from
various sources, including documents, email threads and others, with continuous learning mechanisms to
improve its performance over time. Similarly, GitHub Copilot integrates individual code repositories and
serves as the copilot to boost the productivity of programmers. These personalized RPLAs empower users to
streamline their workflows and enhance productivity within the office environment.

Table 4: Overview of RPLA applications and products based on LLMs. For personalized data, “Personal
Profile” refers to data about one’s identity, including age, appearance, voice, and biographical information.
“Behavior History” denotes data derived from interactions between users and applications, representing user
behavior patterns. “File” pertains to documents and computer files containing private knowledge regardless
of personal identity, such as code and manuals. The three types of personalized data roughly correspond to
profile, interactions, and domain knowledge in §6 respectively.
