Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are recognized as the candidate for the next-generation
neuralnetworksduetotheirbio-plausibilityandenergyefficiency. Recently, researchershave
demonstrated that SNNs are able to achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance in image
recognition tasks using surrogate gradient training. However, some essential questions exist
pertaining to SNNs that are little studied: Do SNNs trained with surrogate gradient learn
different representations from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Does the time
dimension in SNNs provide unique representation power? In this paper, we aim to answer
these questions by conducting a representation similarity analysis between SNNs and ANNs
using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We start by analyzing the spatial dimension of
the networks, including both the width and the depth. Furthermore, our analysis of residual
connections shows that SNNs learn a periodic pattern, which rectifies the representations
in SNNs to be ANN-like. We additionally investigate the effect of the time dimension on
SNN representation, finding that deeper layers encourage more dynamics along the time
dimension. We also investigate the impact of input data such as event-stream data and
adversarial attacks. Our work uncovers a host of new findings of representations in SNNs.
We hope this work will inspire future research to fully comprehend the representation power
of SNNs. Code is released at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/

1 Introduction
Lately, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) (Tavanaei et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020; Panda
et al., 2020; Christensen et al., 2022) have received increasing attention thanks to their biology-inspired
neuron activation and efficient neuromorphic computation. SNNs process information with binary spike
representation and therefore avoid the need for multiplication operations during inference. Neuromorphic
hardware such as TrueNorth (Akopyan et al., 2015) and Loihi (Davies et al., 2018) demonstrate that SNNs
can save energy by orders of magnitude compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Although SNNs can bring enormous energy efficiency in inference, training SNNs is notoriously hard because
of their spiking activation function. This function returns a zero-but-all gradient ( i.e.,Dirac delta function)
and thus makes gradient-based optimization infeasible. To circumvent this problem, various training tech-
niques have been proposed. For example, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) (Rao & Sejnowski, 2001)

encodes the information into the time of spike arrival to get a closed-form solution of the gradients. However,
these two methods are restricted to small-scale tasks and datasets. Surrogate gradient technique (Bengio
et al., 2013; Bender et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018; Bellec et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2022b; Li et al., 2022), on
the other hand, can achieve the best task performance by applying an alternate function during backprop-
agation. Combined with surrogate gradient, SNNs can be optimized by Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) (Neftci et al., 2019) algorithm, outperforming other learning rules in SNNs.
Despite increasing interest in pursuing high-performance SNNs with surrogate gradient training, there is
limited understanding of how surrogate gradient training affects the representation of SNNs. Investigating
this fundamental question is critical since surrogate gradient-based BPTT algorithm mimics the way how
ANN learns and is less biological-plausible compared to other learning rules like STDP. Therefore, it would
be intriguing to study whether surrogate gradient-based SNNs learn different representations than ANNs.
Understanding the representation learned in SNN can also promote further research developments, e.g.,
designing spiking-friendly architectures (Kim et al., 2022a; Na et al., 2022) and exploring other ways to
optimize SNNs (Bellec et al., 2020; Zhang & Li, 2020; Kim & Panda, 2021a).
More concretely, we ask, do SNNs optimized by surrogate gradient BPTT learn distinct representations from
ANNs? How do the width and depth of the neural network affect the representation learned in SNNs and
ANNs? Does the extra temporal dimension in SNNs yield unique intermediate features? On neuromorphic
datasets, how does the SNN process event-based data? In this paper, we aim to answer these core questions
through a detailed analysis of ResNets (He et al., 2016a) and VGG-series (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015)
models using a representation similarity analysis tool. Specifically, we utilize the popular Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019) to measure the similarity between SNNs and ANNs. Fig. 1
demonstrates the overall workflow of our representation similarity analysis framework. Our analysis spans
both the spatial and temporal dimensions of SNNs, as well as the impact of network architecture and input
data.
Our contributions and findings include:
•We analyze the representation similarity between SNNs and ANNs using the centered kernel alignment
to determine whether SNNs produce different feature representations from ANNs. We examine various
aspects of representation similarity between SNNs and ANNs, including spatial and temporal dimensions,
input data type, and network architecture.
•Surprisingly, our findings show that SNNs trained with surrogate gradient have a rather similar represen-
tation to ANNs. We also find that residual connections greatly affect the representations in SNNs.

•Meanwhile, we find that the time dimension in SNNs does not provide much unique representation. We
also find that shallow layers are insensitive to the time dimension, where the representation in each time
step converges together.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). SNNs have gained increasing attention for building low-power intel-
ligence. Generally, the SNN algorithms to obtain high performance can be divided into two categories: (1)
ANN-SNN conversion (Rueckauer et al., 2016; 2017; Han et al., 2020; Sengupta et al., 2019; Han & Roy,
2020) and (2) direct training SNN from scratch (Wu et al., 2018; 2019). Conversion-based methods utilize
the knowledge from ANN and convert the ReLU activation to a spike activation mechanism. This type of
method can produce an SNN in a short time. For example, in Rueckauer et al. (2017), one can find the
percentile number and set it as the threshold for spiking neurons. Authors in Deng & Gu (2021) and Li et al.
(2021a) decompose the conversion error to each layer and then propose to reduce the error by calibrating
the parameters. However, achieving near-lossless conversion requires a considerable amount of time steps
to accumulate the spikes. Direct training from scratch allows SNNs to operate in extremely low time steps,
even less than 5 (Zheng et al., 2020). To enable gradient-based learning, direct training leverages surrogate
gradient to compute the derivative of the discrete spiking function. This also benefits the choice of hyper-
parameters in spiking neurons. Recent works (Fang et al., 2021; Rathi & Roy, 2020; Kim & Panda, 2021b;
Deng et al., 2022) co-optimize parameters, firing threshold, and leaky factor together via gradient descent.
Our analysis is mostly based on directly trained SNNs, as converted SNNs only contain ANN features and
may be misleading for representation comparison.
Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA). RSA (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) was not originally de-
signed for analyzing neural networks specifically. Rather, it is used for representation comparison between
any two computational models. Prior works such as Khaligh-Razavi & Kriegeskorte (2014); Yamins et al.
(2014) have used RSA to find the correlation between visual cortex features and convolutional neural network
features. Authors of Seminar (2016); Raghu et al. (2017); Morcos et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2018) have
studied RSA between different neural networks. However, recent work (Kornblith et al., 2019) argues that
none of the above methods for studying RSA can yield high similarity even between two different initializa-
tions of the same architecture. They further propose CKA, which has become a powerful evaluation tool
for RSA and has been successfully applied in several studies. For example, Nguyen et al. (2020) analyzes
the representation pattern in extremely deep and wide neural networks, and Raghu et al. (2021) studies the
representation difference between convolutional neural networks and vision transformers with CKA. In this
work, we leverage this tool to compare ANNs and SNNs.
3 Preliminary
3.1 ANN and SNN Neurons
In this paper, vectors/matrices are denoted with bold italic/capital letters ( e.g.xandWdenote the input
vector and weight matrix, respectively). Constants are denoted by small upright letters. For non-linear
activation function in artificial neurons, we use the rectified linear unit (ReLU) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012),
given by y= max(0,Wx). As for the non-linear activation function in spiking neurons, we adopt the well-
known Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. Formally, given a membrane potential u(t)at time step tand
a pre-synaptic input i(t+1)=Wx(t+1), the LIF neuron will update as
u(t+1),pre=τu(t)+i(t+1),y(t+1)=/braceleftigg

the firing threshold, the LIF neuron will fire a spike ( y(t+1)= 1) when the membrane potential exceeds the
threshold; otherwise, it will stay inactive ( y(t+1)= 0). After firing, the spike output y(t+1)will propagate to
3Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (04/2023)
the next layer and become the input x(t+1)of the next layer. Note that here the layer index is omitted for
simplicity. The membrane potential will be reset to 0 if a spike fires (refer to Eq. (1) the third sub-equation).
3.2 Optimize SNN with Surrogate Gradient
To enable gradient descent for SNN, we adopt the BPTT algorithm (Werbos, 1990). Formally, denote the
loss function value as L, the gradient of the loss value with respect to weights can be formulated by
∂L
∂W=T/summationdisplay
t=1∂L
∂y(t)∂y(t)
∂u(t),preK(t),where K(t)=/parenleftbigg∂u(t),pre

∂W+∂u(t),pre
∂u(t−1)∂u(t−1)
∂u(t−1),preK(t−1)/parenrightbigg
.(2)
Here, the gradient is computed based on the output spikes from all time steps. In each time step, we denote
Kas the gradient of pre-synaptic membrane potential with respect to weights∂upre
∂W, which consists of the
gradient of pre-synaptic input and the gradient of membrane potential in the last time steps.
As a matter of fact, all terms in Eq. (2) can be easily differentiated except∂y(t)
∂u(t),prewhich returns a zero-
but-all gradient (Dirac delta function). Therefore, the gradient descent ends up either freezing the weights
or updating weights to infinity. To address this problem, the surrogate gradient is proposed (Bender et al.,
2018; Wu et al., 2018; Bellec et al., 2018; Neftci et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021b) to replace the Dirac delta
function with another function:
∂y(t)
∂u(t),pre=1
α1|u(t),pre−vth|<α, (3)
whereαis a hyper-parameter for controlling the sharpness and α= 1the surrogate gradient becomes the
Straight-Through Estimator (Bengio et al., 2013).
Compared to other methods such as ANN-SNN conversion (Deng & Gu, 2021) or spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (Caporale et al., 2008), BPTT using surrogate gradient learning yields the best performance in
image recognition tasks. However, from a biological perspective, BPTT is implausible: for each weight
update, BPTT requires the use of the transpose of the weights to transmit errors backward in time and
assign credit for how past activity affected present performance. Running the network with transposed
weights requires the network to either have two-way synapses or use a symmetric copy of the feedforward
weights to backpropagate the error (Marschall et al., 2020). Therefore, the question remains whether the
representation in SNNs learned with surrogate gradient-based BPTT actually differs from the representation
in ANNs.
3.3 Centered Kernel Alignment
LetXs∈Rm×Tp1andXa∈Rm×p2contain the representation in an arbitrary layer of SNN with p1hidden
neurons across Ttime steps and the representation in an arbitrary layer of ANN with p2hidden neurons,
respectively. Here mis the batch size and we concatenate features from all time steps in the SNN altogether.
We intend to use a similarity index s(Xs,Xa)to describe how similar they are. We use the Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019) to measure this:
CKA (K,L) =HSIC (K,L)/radicalbig
HSIC (K,K)HSIC (L,L),HSIC (K,L) =1
(m−1)2tr(KHLH ). (4)
Here,K=XsX⊤
s,L=XaX⊤
aare the Gram matrices as shown in Fig. 1. Each Gram matrix has the shape
ofm×m, reflecting the similarities between a pair of examples. For example, Ki,jindicates the similarity
between the ithandjthexample in the SNN feature Xs. Further measuring the similarity between KandL,
one can measure whether SNN has a similar inter-example similarity matrix with ANN. Let H=I−1
m11⊤
be the centering matrix, the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) proposed by Gretton et al.
(2005) can conduct a test statistic for determining whether two sets of variables are independent. HSIC
= 0implies independence. The CKA further normalizes HSIC to produce a similarity index between 0 and
1 (the higher the CKA, the more similar the input pair) which is invariant to isotropic scaling. In our
implementation, we use the unbiased estimator of HSIC (Song et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2020) to calculate
it across mini-batches.

4 Do SNNs Learn Different Representation from ANNs?
In this section, we comprehensively compare the representation learned in SNNs and ANNs. Our primary
study case is ResNet with identity mapping block (He et al., 2016b) on the CIFAR10 dataset, which is the
standard architecture and dataset in modern deep learning for image recognition.1There are two differences
between our SNNs and ANNs. First, ANNs adopt the Batch Normalization layer (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015),
and SNNs use the time-dependent Batch Normalization layer (Zheng et al., 2020), which normalizes the
feature across all time steps ( i.e.Xs). Second, the ANNs use ReLU activation, and SNNs leverage the LIF
spiking neurons. For default SNN training, we use direct encoding, τ= 0.5for the leaky factor, vth= 1.0
for the firing threshold, T= 4for the number of time steps, and α= 1.0for surrogate gradient, which are
tuned for the best training performance on SNNs. Detailed training setup and codes can be found in the
supplementary material.
4.1 Scaling up Width or Depth
We begin our study by studying how the spatial dimension of a model architecture affects internal represen-
tation structure in ANNs and SNNs. We first investigate a simple model: ResNet-20, and then we either
increase its number of layers or increase its channel number to observe the effect of depth and width, re-
spectively. In the most extreme cases, we scale the depth to 164 and the width to 16 ×(see detailed network
configuration in Table D.1). For each network, we compute CKA between all possible pairs of layers, includ-

ing convolutional layers, normalization layers, ReLU/LIF layers, and residual block output layers. Therefore,
the total number of layers is much greater than the stated depth of the ResNet, as the latter only accounts
for the convolutional layers in the network. Then, we visualize the result as a heatmap, with the xandy
axes representing the layers of the network, going from the input layer to the output layer. Following Nguyen
et al. (2020), our CKA heatmap is computed on 4096 images from the test dataset.
As shown in Fig. 2, the CKA heatmap emerges as a checkerboard-like grid structure, especially for the
deeper neural network. In ResNet-20, we observe a bright block in the middle and deep layers, indicating
that ANNs and SNNs learn overlapped representation. As the network goes deep, we find the CKA heatmap
becomes darker, meaning that representations in ANNs and those in SNNs are diverging. Notably, we find
a large portion of layers in artificial ResNet-164 exhibit significantly different representations than spiking
ResNet-164 ( <0.2 CKA value) which demonstrates that deeper layers tend to learn disparate features.
In Fig. 2 middle part, we progressively enlarge the channel number of ResNet-20. In contrast to depth,
the heatmap of wider neural networks becomes brighter, which indicates the representations in SNNs and
ANNs are converging. Interestingly, although the majority of layers are learning more similar representations
between ANN and SNN in wide networks, the last several layers still learn different representations.
We further select only the diagonal elements in the heatmap and plot them in Fig. 2 bottom part. Because
SNNs and ANNs have the same network topology, this visualization is more specific and may accurately
reveal the similarity between SNNs and ANNs at each corresponding layer. First, we can find that in Fig. 2
the CKA curve of ResNet-20 shows relatively high values. Most layers go above 0.5 and some of them can
even reach nearly 1.0. Interestingly, we observe that deeper networks tend to derive a curve with a jagged
shape. This means some layers in SNN indeed learn different representations when compared to ANN,
however, the difference is intermittently mitigated . In later sections, we will show that the mitigation of
dissimilarity is performed by residual connection. As for width, we generally notice that CKA curves mostly
become higher for wider networks, especially when comparing ResNet-20 and ResNet-20 ×8, where most
layers have above 0.8 CKA value.
Evaluating the Task Performance. WelayouttheaccuracyofANNsandSNNsinTable1. Additionally,
we also calculate their accuracy difference across different width and depth configurations. We can find that
the accuracy gap decreases if we scale up the width, ranging from 1.39% to 0.05%. However, as the depth
increases, the accuracy gap does not consistently reduce as it does in wider networks. This explains that
wider neural networks which bring more similar representations encourage less accuracy gap. However,
SNNs do not achieve the same accuracy level as ANNs with different representations. This finding means
that current state-of-the-art SNNs relying on wider neural networks (e.g., ResNet-19 (Zheng et al., 2020)
which is similar to our ResNet-20 8 ×) do not truly develop unique feature representations than ANNs.
4.2 The Effect of Residual Connections
In Fig. 2, the CKA curves appear with a periodic jagged shape. To investigate what causes this similarity
oscillation, we investigate each layer in a residual block. In Fig. 3 left, we plot the CKA curve of the ResNet-
110 and additionally sample two residual blocks, the 10- thand the 34- thblock, whose architecture details
are depicted in Fig. 3 right. Surprisingly, we find that every time when the residual connection meets the
main branch, the CKA similarity restores nearly to 1. Moreover, every time when the activation passes a
convolutional layer or an LIF layer, the similarity decreases. The BN layers, in contrast, do not affect the

similarity since it is a linear transformation. These results substantiate that the convolutional layers and LIF
layers in SNNs are able to learn different representations than ANNs. However, the representation in the
residual branch still dominates the representation in post-residual layers and leads to the junction of ANN’s
and SNN’s representation.
To further explore why residual connections can restore the representations in SNNs to ANN-like, we conduct
an ablation study. We select one of the three stages in the spiking ResNet-56 where the residual connections
are disabled selectively. In Fig. 4, we visualize the CKA heatmaps of SNN itself, which means both xand
yaxes are the same layers in SNN. The first heatmap demonstrates the full residual network, while the
remaining three heatmaps show the partial residual networks, with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd stages disabled,
respectively. Our observations can be summarized as follows: (1) In terms of inter-stage similarity, residual
connections can preserve the input information from the previous stage. In the 1st and 2nd heatmaps in
Fig. 4, we find residual blocks can have high similarity with their former stage. The non-residual block,
however, does not have this property. In the 3rd and 4th heatmaps, we can see that blocks without residual
connections exhibit significantly different representations when compared to their former stage. Therefore,
we can find that residual connections preserve the representation in early layers. As such, if ANN and SNN
learn similar representations in the first layer, the similarity can propagate to very deep layers due to residual
connections. (2) In terms of intra-stage similarity, the non-residual stage’s heatmap appears with a uniform
representation across all layers, meaning that layers in this stage are similar. In contrast, residual stages
share a grid structure.
Next, we verify the accuracy of SNNs and ANNs when both are equipped with residual connections or not,
under different network depths. As shown in Table 2, both the SNNs and ANNs can successfully train very

deep networks if the residual connections are enabled. In this case, though SNNs do not surpass the accuracy
of ANNs, the gap is relatively small, with 1 ∼2% accuracy degradation. However, if the residual connections
are removed from SNNs, the gap between the accuracies of ANNs and SNNs significantly enlarges, ranging
from 5∼56%. Therefore, we can conclude that the residual connections help the gradient descent optimization
in SNNs and regularize the representations in SNNs to be similar to those in ANNs so that SNNs can have
similar task performances with ANNs.
4.3 Scaling up Time Steps
The results of the previous sections help characterize the effects of spatial structure on internal represen-
tation differences between SNNs and ANNs. Next, we ask whether the time dimension helps SNN learn
some unique information. To verify this, we train several spiking ResNet-20 with 4/8/16/32/64/128 time
steps and calculate the ANN-SNN CKA similarity. In Fig. 5, we envision the CKA heatmaps and curves
respectively between artificial ResNet-20 and spiking ResNet-20 with various time steps. Notably, we cannot
find significant differences among these heatmaps. Looking at the CKA curves, we also discover that many
layers are overlapped, especially when we focus on the residual block output (the local maximums). We find
similarities between different time steps reaching the same point, meaning that the time step variable does
not provide much unique representation in SNNs.

Reduce the time steps in the last stage 87.41 87.78 87.38 87.73
indicating extremely high similarity in these blocks. The second stage starts to produce differences across
time steps, but they still share >0.8 similarities between any pair of time steps. The last stage, especially
the last block, demonstrates around 0.5 similarities between different time steps. To summarize, the impact
of time in SNN is gradually increased as the feature propagates through the network. In Appendix A.4, we
provide the heatmap of convolutional/LIF layers and find a similar trend.
We further conduct an empirical verification to verify the findings in Fig. 6. More specifically, we define
a sensitivity metric and measure it by reducing the number of time steps to 1 in certain layers of an SNN
and recording the corresponding accuracy degradation. In Fig. 6 we find the first stage (s1) has the same
representation in time dimension while the last stage (s3) exhibits a more diverse representation. Therefore,
we choose to reduce the number of time steps to 1 either in s1 or in s3. To achieve this “mixed-time-
step SNN", we repeat/average the activation in time dimension after s1/before s3 to match the dimension.
Table 3 summarizes the sensitivity results. We observe that the first stage can have much lower accuracy
degradation (<1%), while the last stage drop 2 ∼4% accuracy. Moreover, if the last stage only uses 1 time
step, then increasing the time steps for the other two stages does not benefit the accuracy at all. This
indicates that LIF neurons are more effective in deep layers than in shallow layers.
4.4 Representation under Event Data
In this section, we evaluate the CKA similarity on the event-based dataset. We choose CIFAR10-DVS (Li
et al., 2017), N-Caltech 101 (Orchard et al., 2015) and train spiking/artificial ResNet-20. Since the ANN
cannot process 4-dimensional spatial-temporal event data easily, we integrate all events into one frame for
ANN training and 10 frames for SNN training. Fig. 7 provides the CKA heatmaps/curves on the event
dataset, showing a different similarity distribution than the previous CIFAR-10 dataset. The heatmaps
have a different pattern and the curves also do not appear with a periodic jagged shape. In addition, the
similarity distribution differs at the dataset level, i.e., the CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech 101 share different

CKA curves and heatmaps. On N-Caltech 101, the SNN learns different feature representations compared
with ANN in shallow and deep layers, but similar representation in intermediate layers. For CIFAR10-DVS,
the similarity continues to decrease from 0.9 to 0.5 as the layers deepen. In summary, with the event-based
dataset, SNNs and ANNs share a different CKA pattern in comparison to the natural image dataset, which
implies that SNNs may have further optimization space in this type of dataset. We put more CKA results
on various models for the CIFAR10-DVS dataset in Appendix A.3.
4.5 Representation under Adversarial Attack Data
We next study the adversarial robustness of SNN and ANN using CKA. Inspired by quantized ANNs that are
robust to adversarial attack Lin et al. (2019), the SNNs could also inherit this property since their activations
are also discrete. Previous works have explored understanding the inherent robustness of SNNs (Sharmin
et al., 2020; Kundu et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Kim & Panda, 2021c). However, they either evalu-
ate on converted SNN or using rate-encoded images. Here, we test Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
attack (Madry et al., 2017) on the directly trained SNN and ANN using direct encoding. Formally, we
generate the adversarial images by restricting the L-infinity norm of the perturbation, given by
xk+1
adv= ΠPϵ(x)(xk
adv+αsign(∇xk
advL(xk
adv,w,y))), (5)
where xk
advis the generated adversarial sample at the k-thiteration. ΠPϵ(x)(·)projects the generated sample
onto the projection space, the ϵ−L∞neighborhood of the clean sample. αis the attack optimization step
size. With higher ϵ, the adversarial image is allowed to be perturbed in a larger space, thus degrading task
performance.
We evaluate the performance of spiking and artificial ResNet-20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset with ϵvalues
ranging from 0.001,0.005,0.01,0.02,0.05to generate adversarial images. We then compute the CKA value
between the features of the clean images and the adversarially corrupted images. The results are summarized
in Fig. 8 (left). We find that although the clean accuracy of ANN is higher than that of SNN, SNN has higher
robustness against adversarial attacks. For example, the PGD attack with 0.01 L-infinity norm perturbation
reduces the accuracy of ANN by 43%, while only reducing the accuracy of SNN by 22%. We also investigate
the CKA similarity between clean and adversarial images, as shown in the second and third subplots of
Fig. 8. We observe that the higher the robustness against adversarial attacks, the higher the similarity
between clean and corrupted images. This intuition is confirmed by the CKA curves, which show that SNN
has a higher similarity than ANN. We also observe several interesting phenomena. For example, the ANN
10Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (04/2023)
suffers a large decrease in similarity in the first block, even with a small ϵvalue of 0.001. Additionally, when
we focus on the purple line ( ϵ= 0.02), we notice that ANN and SNN have similar perseverance in earlier
layers, but ANN drops much more similarity than SNN in the last block. These results provide insight into
model robustness and suggest that SNNs are more robust than ANN, especially in their shallow and deep
layers.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
Given that SNNs are drawing increasing research attention due to their bio-plausibility and recent progress
in task performance, it is necessary to verify if SNNs, especially those trained with the surrogate gradient
algorithms, can or have the potential to truly develop desired features different from ANNs. In this work,
we conduct a pilot study to examine the internal representation of SNNs and compare it with ANNs using
the popular CKA metric. This metric measures how two models respond to two different examples. Our
findings can be briefly summarized as follows:
1. Generally, the layer-wise similarity between SNNs and ANNs is high, suggesting SNNs trained with
surrogate gradient learn similar representation with ANNs. Moreover, wider networks like ResNet-20 8 ×
can even have >0.8similarities for almost all layers.
2. For extremely deep ANNs and SNNs, the CKA value would become lower, however, the residual con-
nections play an important role in regularizing the representations. By conducting ablation studies, we
demonstrate that the residual connections make SNNs learn similar representations with ANNs and help
SNNs achieve high accuracy.
3. ThetimedimensiondoesnotprovidemuchadditionalrepresentationpowerinSNNs. Wealsodemonstrate
that the shallow layers learn completely static representation along the time dimension. Even reducing
the number of time steps to 1 in shallow layers does not significantly affect the performance of SNNs.
4. On other types of datasets, SNNs may develop less similar representations with ANNs, e.g.,event-data.
Our results show that SNNs optimized by surrogate gradient algorithm do not learn distinct spatial-temporal
representation compared to the spatial representation in ANNs. Current SNN learning relies on the residual
connection and wider neural networks (for example, Zheng et al. (2020) use ResNet-19 which is similar to our
ResNet-20 8×) to obtain decent task performance. However, our study suggests that this task performance
is highly credited to the similar representation with ANN. Furthermore, the time dimension brings limited
effect to the SNN representation on static datasets like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. In particular, the first
stage of ResNets results in quite similar representation across time steps.
Nonetheless, our study is not a negation against SNNs. Our results are based on the surrogate-gradient
BPTT optimization, which, as aforementioned, is inherently bio-implausible and resembles the optimization
method for ANNs. Therefore, it may not be surprising to see SNNs and ANNs have similar representations
under a similar optimization regime. Additionally, we find that input data is also important in developing
the representations. Indeed, the direct encoding used in SNNs inputs the same static images for each time
step, again leading to less gap between the representations of ANNs and SNNs.
Here, we provide several directions worth studying in the future: a) Bio-plausible learning rule for SNNs:
surrogate gradient training tends to learn an ANN-like representation in SNN, thus it is necessary to develop
an optimization method that suits SNN better. b) Spiking architecture design: a specialized SNN network
architecture may avoid learning similar representation, e.g.,Kim et al. (2022a). c) Understanding the
robustness of SNN: adversarial attack is inconsequential for human visual systems, which may be reflected
in SNN as well. We believe the SNN robustness can be significantly improved. To conclude, our work tries
to understand the representation of SNNs trained with surrogate gradient and reveals some counter-intuitive
observations. We hope our work can inspire more research in pushing the limit of SNNs.

A.1.1 Scaling up Width or Depth
In this section, we study the representation similarity between ANNs and SNNs based on VGG-series net-
works Simonyan & Zisserman (2015). Since VGG-Networks do not employ residual connections, they may
bring different representation heatmaps when compared to ResNets. We first evaluate if the spatial scaling
observation in ResNets can also be found in VGG Networks. Starting from a VGG-13, we either increase its
channel size to 10 times as before or its number of layers to 43, (detailed network configuration is provided
in Table D.2). Since VGG networks do not contain residual connections, we could scale less depth in VGG
networks than ResNets.
The results are illustrated in Fig. A.1. We can find that for deeper networks, the heatmaps tend to exhibit
a hierarchical structure, which means the shallow layers and deeper layers have different representations.
Increasing the number of layers in VGG networks to 19 or 25, the shallower and deeper layers only have 0.3
CKA similarity (purple). More seriously, when the network depth reaches 31 or 43, the similarity becomes
0.4 even across each other in deeper layers, indicating the representations are diverging. Another important
discovery for deep VGG networks is the disappearance of periodical CKA curve, which is likely due to the
lack of residual connections.

time steps in the output of convolutional layers. The top/middle/bottom rows stand for spiking ResNet-20 with
4/8/32 time steps.
A.1.2 Scaling up Time Steps
We next study whether the time dimension in spiking VGG networks has a similar effect to that in spiking
ResNets. As can be found in Fig. A.2, the spiking VGG-13s with 4/8/16/32 time steps do not show a
significant difference in CKA heatmaps as well as CKA curves, which is the same with Fig. 5. Fig. A.3 shows
the CKA across different time steps in the spiking VGGs. In the first layer, the convolution does not have
dynamic representation through time. As the layer goes deeper, the dissimilarity across time steps continues
to increase, similar to Fig. 6.

A.2 Results on CIFAR-100
The results we reported in the main context are majorly based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here, we provide
the visualizations on the CIFAR-100 dataset to further strengthen our findings in the main context.
We first report the spatial dimension results, i.e., scaling up the width and depth of the network. Starting
from the ResNet-20, we either increase its width to 164 layers or increase its width to 8 times as before. The
visualizations are shown below. We find extremely deep networks, e.g., ResNet-164, has a very dark heatmap
compared to the ResNet-20 heatmap. The wider network shows somewhat irregular results. The extremely
wide network — ResNet-20 ×8— yet has even lowest similarity in the last several blocks. However, it has
the highest similarity in the output layer.

whole network. The visualization is shown in Fig. A.6, where we find similar observations.
We also run experiments to test the time dimension of SNNs on CIFAR-100. In Fig. A.7, we train 4 spiking

the CKA heatmap and the CKA curve show little variations by changing the number of time steps. This
confirms the results on CIFAR-10. In addition, we visualize the CKA similarities across time steps in each
residual block. Fig. A.8 demonstrates that the first stage still produces temporal static features while the
last stage has lower similarity across time steps.

plot the CKA curve between the feature of clean images and the feature of corrupted images. The results

A.3 Results on CIFAR10-DVS
In this section, we conduct a representation similarity analysis on an event-based dataset—CIFAR10-DVS Li
et al. (2017). As aforementioned in Fig. 7, the event dataset may generate different CKA heatmaps and
curves when compared to the static dataset. Here, we first scale up the spatial dimensions in SNNs and
ANNs for the CIFAR10-DVS dataset. As shown in Fig. A.10, we gradually increase either the depth to 110
layers or the width to 8 times as before.
Increasing the depth of ResNets on CIFAR10-DVS demonstrates a similar effect when compared to static
CIFAR-10. Interestingly, the deep ResNet, for example, ResNet-110, emerges a similar periodical pattern to
that on static CIFAR-10. However, we can find the peak CKA value is only around 0.75, (recall that the
20Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (04/2023)
peak CKA value on the CIFAR10 dataset is nearly 0.95, cf. Fig. 2), indicating the CIFAR10-DVS creates
higher ANN-SNN difference in representations.

Figure A.11: The similarity across times in SNN on CIFAR10-DVS. Each heatmap shows the CKA among
different time steps in the output of residual block. “s” means stage, and “b” means block. The model is trained
with 10 time steps, i.e., 10 frames integrated for each CIFAR10-DVS data input.
For the extremely wide neural network, the trend holds for ResNet-20, ResNet-20 ( ×2), and ResNet-20
(×4). However, we find the ResNet-20 (×8)exhibits a significantly low CKA curve than other models. The
difference may come from the artificial ResNet-20 (×8). According to the CKA heatmap, the 35th −60th
layers in artificial ResNet-20 (×8)become much darker than other heatmaps. We hypothesize that, with a
21Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (04/2023)
larger capacity of the neural network on the layer dynamics in the input data, the representation may change
significantly.
We next study the internal CKA of each convolution in ResNet-20, which reveals the temporal dynamics
of each convolution. As illustrated in Fig. A.11, the first convolution demonstrates dynamic features across
10 time steps, which shows different characteristics with static dataset (cf. Fig. A.12). Another notable
difference is that the first and the second time step show very low similarity with other time steps. In
summary, the rich temporal information dataset may increase the dynamics in SNNs across time steps and
bring more differences when compared to ANNs.
A.4 Similarity Across Time
In addition to the residual block, we also visualize the CKA heatmaps of convolutional layers and ReLU/LIF
layers by comparing the similarity among different time steps. As can be seen in Fig. A.12, different from
residual blocks, the similarity in convolutional and activation layers is more dynamic. Even in the first stage,
the convolutional layers show different outputs across different time steps. This result further confirms our
observations in residual blocks, where we found the convolutional and activation layers always decrease the
ANN-SNN similarity while the residual block restores the similarity. Therefore, it suggests that a more
temporal dynamic CKA heatmap may produce distinct features.
B Numerical Results
Here, we provide the clean accuracy of our trained models, both on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. All models
are trained with 300 epochs of stochastic gradient descent. The learning rate is set to 0.1 followed by a cosine
annealing decay. The weight decay is set to 0.0001 for all models. The original ResNet-20 is a 3-stage model,
each stage contains 2 residual blocks. The first stage contains 16 channels and the channels are doubled
every time when entering the next stage. ResNet-38/56/110/164 contains 6/9/18/27 residual blocks in each
stage. The wider networks just simply multiply all the channels by a fixed factor. We provide their top-1

C The Effect of Network Initialization
In this section, we study the effect of network initialization and verify if our findings are invariant to different
initialization. Specifically, we train spiking and artificial ResNet-20s with two random seeds and measure the
CKAsimilarityonthese4models. Fig.C.1showsthecaseofCKAheatmapsonthesamemodel: thefirsttwo
columns demonstrate the CKA heatmaps of the same initialization and the third column demonstrates the

CKAheatmapsofdifferentinitialization. WecanfindthatSNNsorANNstrainedwithdifferentinitialization
share a high CKA similarity. Moreover, in Fig. C.2, we compare the CKA between SNNs and ANNs by
permuting two different initialization. It can be seen that all four permutations have a similar distribution
of CKA values. By comparing Fig. C.2 and Fig. C.1, we also find that the CKA heatmaps between ANNs
and SNNs are also similar to the CKA heatmaps on the same model with two initializations. This indicates
that the similarity between ANN and SNN is quite high.
