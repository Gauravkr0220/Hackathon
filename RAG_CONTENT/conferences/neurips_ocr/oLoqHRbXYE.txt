Abstract
We propose an unsupervised adaptation framework, Self-TAught Recognizer
(STAR), which leverages unlabeled data to enhance the robustness of automatic
speech recognition (ASR) systems in diverse target domains, such as noise and
accents. STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on
Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper,
Canary; SeamlessM4T). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empiri-
cally integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level
quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for
effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves
an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target do-
mains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of su-
pervised adaptation. Meanwhile, we observe that STAR prevents the adapted
model from the catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain
data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less
than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech
models in recognition and translation tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

1 Introduction
Human speech, characterized by its inherent acoustic nuances [ 70] and variability across speakers [ 27],
is further complicated by the diverse and unpredictable environments. These factors contribute to
significant domain distinctions in the speech signal, with differences in accent, speaking style, and
background noise (visualized in Appendix B). Consequently, this diversity poses significant challenges
in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR), especially under diverse conditions [51].
In recent years, advancements in ASR technology [ 30,84,12,73] have been boosted, primarily
by the use of deep neural models and supervised learning with high-quality datasets. In particular,
end-to-end ASR models pre-trained on industry-scale datasets have been made publicly available
to the research community, such as OpenAI Whisper [ 73], Meta SeamlessM4T [ 4] and NVIDIA
Canary [ 71]. Considering the high diversity of speech domains, even a well-trained ASR foundation
model usually performs less satisfactorily when encountering a domain shift problem [ 49,83,85].
This performance degradation stems from a critical dilemma: collecting and labelling sufficient
training data in the target domain is immensely time-consuming and labour-intensive, thus hindering
the domain adaptation process of ASR models. Some existing efforts [ 32,44] focus on leveraging
labelled source domain and unlabeled target domain data to enhance the ASR performance, as shown

in Fig. 1 (i). This solution is generally known as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [ 24,32,44]
and has been widely explored in both machine learning and speech processing communities.
In the context of the UDA problem in ASR, the human “self-directed” ability [ 39,17] when encoun-
tering an unfamiliar speech domain is first illustrated. Despite the unawareness of the ground truth
labels of our heard speech, individuals can learn speech-to-text mapping from their self-directed
transcriptions, particularly when they have high confidence (see Fig. 8). This learning mechanism
has a parallel in machine learning, known as “self-training” [ 75,90,41], which typically involves
two stages. First, a pre-trained model generates the pseudo labels on target-domain data. Then, these
data with pseudo labels, along with the associated confidence levels, are used to adapt the model.
Meanwhile, unlike approaches in existing ASR literature, which often require the source data (data
used to pre-train the ASR model in source domains) to achieve UDA [ 63,15,5], humans, as the gold
standard of speech communication, can address UDA issues in ASR without requiring any source
data. Considering the exhibited generality of the speech foundation models with Transformer-related
architectures based on the attention mechanism, it is the opportune moment to centre the attention
mechanism on addressing the source-free UDA problem within the realm of ASR. Specifically, we
study to adapt the pre-trained Whisper model using a small amount of unlabeled data from the target
domain to become a domain-specific speech recognizer in different scenarios without using any
source data, based on the process analogous to the human speech recognition as shown in Fig. 1 (ii).
We hereby highlight the significant potential value that research on source-free UDA contributes to
general ASR applications [ 3]: (i) It circumvents the extensive computational resources by adapting
the ASR models without using any source data. (ii) It can considerably improve ASR performance in
the target domain using only a small amount of speech samples without ground-truth labels.
In this work, we propose a source-free UDA approach called Self-TAught Recognizer (STAR),
which aims to enhance the performance of speech foundation models in specific target domains
with unlabeled data. Based on the typical self-training scheme [ 92], STAR delves deeply into a
general issue: Given the absence of ground-truth labels, how do we assess the quality of pseudo labels
for guiding self-training? Unlike humans who can intuitively gauge their confidence in listening,
the decoding “confidence scores” from attention-based ASR models are typically approximated
by the pseudo posterior probabilities from softmax function [ 53] , which may be unreliable due
to the well-known over-confident issue of softmax [ 37]. Traditionally with HMM-based ASR, the
confidence scores can be estimated based on lattice and confusion network data structures [ 18,61,91],
which, however, are difficult to obtain effectively in the end-to-end ASR framework.
In pursuit of a better quality indicator, we explore the self-attention matrix obtained during auto-
regressive decoding, as it is not only grounded on speech input but also focuses on linguistic
acceptability [ 36]. Specifically, we find the aggregated attention weights can be a more reliable
indicator for measuring the quality of ASR-decoded tokens than the confidence scores. However,
such an attentive score suffers from numerical instability, as recent findings [ 82,62] from linguistic
perspectives, it is normal for equally correct words (e.g., prepositions and nouns) to receive different
semantic roles in a text sentence. This leads to the sub-optimality of using attentive scores alone
to guide the fine-tuning process. We first substantiate these observations experimentally and then,
in our STAR method, propose a novel integration approach based on their distinct characteristics,
resulting in a both stable and reliable STAR indicator. Finally, it is employed to guide the subsequent
finetuning process in a re-weighting manner, making a specific form of instructive adaptation.
2Our experiments evaluate the proposed STAR in various practical scenarios, including background
noise, speaker accents, and specific scenarios (e.g., interviews and talks). Comprehensive results
show the significant gains from STAR that enhances Whisper by an average of 13.5% relative word
error rate (WER) reduction across 14 target domains. On some corpora, unsupervised STAR even
approaches the upper bound of supervised adaptation using real labels. We also surprisingly observe
that with informed finetuning, STAR prevents the adapted models from the common catastrophic
forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STAR
enjoys: (i) remarkable data efficiency: it requires less than one hour of unlabeled data to adapt
Whisper to its best performance on target domains; (ii) seamless generality: it is applicable to many
prevalent speech foundation models and can be easily extended to the speech translation task.
In general, our contributions are summarized as follows:
•We direct our focus on source-free UDA in ASR with as one setting closed to real-world
applications, where only a pre-trained speech foundation model and unlabeled speech
samples are required to adapt to specific target domains.
•We present a score-based self-training approach called STAR that includes a novel indicator
to evaluate the pseudo-label quality and achieve informed finetuning, which significantly
enhances the domain-specific capabilities of speech foundation models across a wide range
of target domains, including noise, accent, and specific scenarios.
•Intensive experiments demonstrate that STAR effectively avoids the common catastrophic
forgetting problem in adaptation. Our further analysis of data efficiency and generality shows
its potential for real-world applications, such as incremental updates for voice assistant.
2 Related Work
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in ASR. Since acquiring the ground truth speech transcriptions
is often prohibitively expensive in the target domain, many existing efforts bootstrap from available
out-of-domain data to build an improved target domain model [ 79,59,93]. Besides directly simu-
lating the target domain speech [ 31,7], adversarial learning is frequently utilized to learn invariant
representations to mitigate domain shifts [ 33,23], which is also applied for front-end speech en-
hancement [ 64]. Meanwhile, teacher-student learning provides an alternative solution for efficient
adaptation [ 50,65]. These methods are also semi-supervised [ 86], since labels from the source
domain are available. More recently, self-supervised pre-trained models (e.g. wav2vec2 [ 2]) have
been used for pseudo-labelling to achieve unsupervised adaptation [44, 38].
Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation. Given the potential presence of sensitive infor-
mation in the source data [ 78], there is a high demand for source-free UDA methods that transfer a
pre-trained source model to the unlabeled target domain without any source data [ 47,66,16]. As a
long-discussed machine learning issue, the mainstream solutions include self-supervised knowledge
distillation [ 57], contrastive learning [ 35], hidden structure mining [ 89], and uncertainty-guided adap-
tation [ 20]. Considering the inherent uncertainty in ASR decoding, we focus on the latter category
and briefly review some representative indicators of uncertainty. Recently, there are some works [ 9]
suggesting measuring uncertainty by the predicted variance from Monte Carlo Dropout [ 42], utilizing
aleatoric uncertainty by encouraging intra-domain consistency [ 48], performing pseudo-labeling
denoising using soft label correction [ 87], and introducing self-entropy descent mechanism to find a
threshold for pseudo-labeling [ 54]. It is worth noting that, confidence estimation for ASR systems can
be dated back for decades, starting by using lattices and confusion networks [ 18,61] for HMM-based
systems. Improved confidence estimation can be achieved by model-based approaches, such as condi-
tional random fields [ 76], recurrent neural networks [ 40,74] and graph neural networks [ 52]. More
recent efforts [ 60,77] focus on predicting uncertainty for auto-regressive decoding of attention-based
models, however, they have not been applied in the source-free UDA.
Summary. Given the large amount of data used to pre-train the speech foundation models, it is
difficult to define the scope of its source domain and keep the source data for re-training. Therefore
we believe it is necessary to directly adapt speech foundation models to target domains for UDA for
speech tasks. The proposed STAR method aims to assess the quality of pseudo labels produced by
the auto-regressive decoding process, which leads to an instructive and effective self-training process.
Since STAR can remove the need for keeping and retraining with source data and considerably reduce
the performance difference between using ground truth and pseudo labels for adaptation with target
3domain data samples, it has the potential to fulfil the goal of source-free UDA for the ASR task and
achieve user-friendly deployment for real-world speech-based artificial intelligence products.
3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Setup
ASR Formulation. An end-to-end ASR system relies on a neural model fto recognize the input
speech x∈RTinto the corresponding text transcription y∈RL, where TandLdenote the lengths of
the input waveform and output text sequences respectively. During training, the model fis optimized
by teacher-forcing [46] with cross-entropy loss:
LASR(x, y) =LX
l=1−logPθ(yl|yl−1,···, y1, x), (1)
where y1:Ldenotes the tokens in ground-truth labels y, and θdenotes the trainable parameters in f.
UDA Setting. Given a source ASR model f(s)trained on labelled source domain data {X(s),Y(s)} ∈
D(s), domain adaption in ASR aims to transfer the learned knowledge and obtain a model f(t)that
performs well on target domain D(t), i.e., f(t):X(t)→ Y(t). UDA is required if ground-truth labels
Y(t)are not available. Source-free UDA [ 19,55] posts a more challenging but practical scenario,
where the source data {X(s),Y(s)}used to pre-train the ASR is no longer available in adaptation.
That is, only speech inputs X(t)is available when adapting the source model f(s)to the target domain
D(t).Self-training Strategy. In source-free UDA, since a source model itself typically generates
pseudo-labels, some previous works [ 80] have referred to this learning approach as semi-supervised
learning . To distinguish it from unsupervised domain adaptation, in this paper, we refer to the
approach for addressing source-free UDA as self-training , consistent with the terminology used in
studies [ 92]. Specifically, we adopt the pipeline of pseudo-labeling andinformed finetuning . First,
N(t)unlabeled speech segments X(t)={x(t)
i}N(t)
i=1are fed into source model f(s)to generate the
pseudo labels corresponding to each of them, which are denoted as ˆY(t)={ˆy(t)
i}N(t)
i=1. Then, the
paired dataset with the speech inputs and their newly-generated pseudo labels {X(t),ˆY(t)}are used
to finetune the source model to the target domain based on the self-training loss LST:
LST(X(t),ˆY(t)) =N(t)X
i=1LASR(x(t)
i,ˆy(t)
i), (2)
where the ASR loss LASRfollows the definition in Eq. (1).
Summary . Since self-generated pseudo labels [ 63] do not introduce extra supervised information
to the ASR source model, simply repeating this process is unlikely to yield performance improve-
ments [ 75]. However, if high-quality pseudo labels are selected as domain-specific exemplars to
inform the speech foundation model, it would then update in a direction beneficial to the target
domain performance. Therefore, we propose a critical research question: How can we assess the
quality of pseudo labels using an indicator that can also guide the model’s update ? The subsequent
content of this section will delve into a detailed discussion from both token and utterance levels.
3.2 Token-level Assessment and Re-weighting
The auto-regressive decoding in ASR can provide step-wise information on predicted tokens, which
can be used for token-level uncertainty assessment [ 60,77]. More importantly, this information can
guide the subsequent training process: assigning different weights to each token when calculating the
CE loss in Eq.(2), namely informed finetuning .
Why is confidence not a good indicator? The confidence score denotes the highest value among
the posterior probability predicted by a neural model. In auto-regressive decoding, the l-th step of
token confidence score Clcan be denoted as:
Cl= max P( ˆyl|ˆyl−1:1, x, θ∗). (3)

matrix and attentive scores. (Right-Up): Confusion matrix of confidence and attentive scores, where
the y-axis denotes the pseudo token is correct or wrong, and the x-axis denotes the corresponding
score is high or low (with 1 as the threshold, more analysis is in Fig. 6), so that the diagonal values
indicate the score’s reliability in assessing the quality of pseudo-label. (Right-Down): Variance of
the two scores of correct and wrong pseudo tokens.
By preserving the Cfor each token during pseudo-labeling, we can perform informed finetuning with
a re-weighting loss as follows:
eLASR(x,ˆy) =LX
l=1−logPθ(ˆyl|ˆyl−1:1, x)· Cl. (4)
However, a substantial body of existing research [ 81] indicates that confidence does not accurately
reflect predictive accuracy, especially in auto-regressive decoding [ 60]. In Eq. (4), the prediction of
the current token is influenced by previously predicted tokens ˆyl−1:1, which can easily lead to error
accumulation and propagation. We further inspect this claim in Whisper by empirical observation.
As shown in Fig. 2 (Right-Up), we employ a confusion matrix to visualize the relationship between
confidence score and pseudo-label quality, which shows that 52% of correct tokens are assigned low
confidence and 60% of wrong tokens are assigned high confidence (more discussion is in Appendix C).
Therefore, confidence cannot be a reliable pseudo-label quality indicator alone, like discussed in [ 21].
Isattentive score a better indicator? We explore if the self-attention matrix Wobtained during
auto-regressive decoding can reflect the pseudo-label quality. Unlike Cldefined in Eq. (3),Whas
a direct association with Xand linguistic acceptability [ 72], which means that it might be less
influenced by the variability of speech input (see example in Fig. 2).
Empirical Observation . Starting from the fourth row and fourth column (first 3 tokens are fixed
prompts: “ ⟨|en|⟩⟨|transcribe |⟩⟨|notimestamps |⟩”), for the correctly decoded tokens (black), the
attention weights are concentrated on the diagonal and partially fall on other pseudo tokens. However,
for wrongly decoded tokens (red), the attention weights almost all fall on the second column that
corresponds to the task prompt token “⟨|transcribe |⟩”(highlighted in red boxes). To quantify this
finding into a numerical metric, we defined an “aggregate pattern" indicator called attentive score ,
which is highlighted in the orange box in Fig. 2 and formulated as:
Al=lX
j=4Wl,j+LX
i=l+1Wi,l, (5)
whereAlindicates the global semantic correlations between pseudo token ˆylwith all tokens {ˆyl}L
l=4
(first 3 tokens are task prompt). Specifically, we add the second term to also consider the attention
weights with respect to future tokens, in order to capture the comprehensive global context to better
assess the role of current token (see Table 7 for ablation study). We compare the values of attentive
scoreAland confidence score Clfor this sentence in Fig. 2 (Left). As marked by black boxes, Cl
provides unreliable assessments for both ‘ board ’ (correct but low Cl) and ‘ year . ⟨|eos|⟩’(wrong
but high Cl). In comparison, Alcan accurately reflect the correctness of these tokens. To avoid
randomness, we analyze CHiME-4 test-real and plot a confusion matrix in Fig. 2 (Right-Up). It is
evident that, compared to Cl, ourAlmore reliably assesses the quality of predicted tokens.
5Despite reliability, Alexhibits less numerical stability, e.g., “for” and “housing” are both correct
tokens but their Alare distinct (1.8 vs. 0.8). The underlying reason is that their roles in the global
context as prepositions and nouns are indeed different [ 82,62]. However, when we try to use this Al
to guide the ASR loss re-weighting like Eq.(4), these labels are expected to be assigned comparable
weights as they are equally correct. We verify this finding with the variance of AlandClin Fig. 2
(Right-Down). For both correct and wrong tokens, Alexhibits higher variance, indicating it may not
be suitable to guide the finetuning in a re-weighting manner directly.
STAR Indicator: Reliable and Stable. To integrate the advantages of CfandAf, we introduce a
new indicator that balances reliability and stability. Specifically, in cases where CfandAfexhibit
conflicting values toward a pseudo token, we would select Afas an indicator that shows higher
reliability. It can be mathematically formulated as:
Sconf
l= [σ(A2
l/Cl−λ) +σ(C2
l/Al−λ)]∗ Al, (6)
where σdenotes the sigmoid function σ(x) = 1 /(1 +e−x), and here it simulates the step function
to capture the cases of conflicting scores. Our definition of conflict is A2
l/Cllarger than a hyper-
parameter threshold λ. This criterion can be decoupled into two terms, AlandAl/Cl, which means a
large attentive score as well as a large gap between attentive and confidence scores1. Similarly, C2
l/Al
is another case of conflicting scores, and we add them up to simulate the logical “OR” operation.
On the other hand, if AfandCfpresent consistent assessment towards a pseudo token, Cfwould be
used to scale Afusing its stability. Specifically, we design a soft interpolation strategy inspired by
focal loss [56] to integrate them:
Scons
l= [σ(λ− A2
l/Cl)∗σ(λ− C2
l/Al)]∗ Al∗e(Cl−Al)/τ. (7)
Similarly, we also use Sigmoid function to simulate the non-conflicting cases, where we multiply
the two terms to denote logical “AND”. Inspired by the smoothing technique in focal loss [ 56], we
propose to leverage the gap between two scores for scaling Al∗e(Cl−Al)/τ, where τis temperature.
During the subsequent informed finetuning stage, we combine the two indicators above to guide the
training process in a re-weighting manner, and Eq.(4) should be re-written as:
eLASR(x,ˆy) =LX
l=1−logPθ(ˆyl|ˆyl−1:1, x)∗ Sl;where Sl=Sconf
l+Scons
l. (8)
As a result, the STAR scores are both reliable and stable as shown in Fig. 5, which serves as a better
quality indicator to guide the informed finetuning (see Algorithm 1 in Appendix for details).
3.3 Utterance-level Filtering
The utterance-level filtering aims to remove those predicted utterances with low overall quality since
they are probably harmful for subsequent adaptation. We now introduce several existing approaches
to assess the utterance-level quality of pseudo labels, which are often used for uncertainty estimation.
Notably, high uncertainty usually implicates low quality for the generated sequence.
Monte Carlo Sampling [42] conduct multiple times of stochastic forward decoding with activated
dropout to get a list of predictions [ 9]. Then the list with a large variance is considered to have high
uncertainty and should be removed from subsequent training. However, this method does not apply
to Whisper as it does not use dropout in training. As an alternative, we introduce a similar method for
assessing utterance-level uncertainty. Specifically, given an input speech x, we first implement one
forward decoding and set the result ˆyas the base transcription. Then, we randomly disturb the model
weights of Whisper with Gaussian noise, and repeat the forward decoding for Ktimes, resulting
in a list of pseudo transcriptions {ˆyk}K
k=1. Thereafter, we calculate the edit distance (ED) between
pseudo transcription ˆykand the base transcription ˆy, which indicates the impact of disturbance on
Whisper decoding. Then, the model’s robustness in transcribing speech xcan be calculated as:
U(x,ˆy) =1
KKX
k=1ED(ˆy,ˆyk). (9)
1To avoid special cases like two tiny scores where one is many times of another (e.g., 0.01, 0.001).

After obtaining kpseudo labels, we can examine their diversity to further assess the model’s un-
certainty. If there are many repetitions in the list, it indicates that the model is more confident in
transcribing speech x. Therefore, we utilize a scaling factor lthat is equal to the utterance amount
after de-duplication. The final utterance-level quality is combined by the numeric multiplication of
landU(x,ˆy), which is then used to rank the Ntpseudo data samples, and top α%samples are re-
moved due to large data uncertainty. Additionally, we also implement a beam search decoding and a
consensus decoding [61] baselines as alternative utterance-level filtering approaches for comparison,
where more experimental results and discussions are presented in Appendix D.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 ASR Domains
We introduce STAR in various ASR domains to verify its general effectiveness, including noisy
speech, accented speech, and specific scenarios. First, for noisy speech we use the CHiME-4 [ 83],
LibriSpeech-FreeSound [ 69], and RATS [ 26] datasets, which covers a wide range of noise types
including bus, cafe, pedestrian area, street junctions, babble, car, airport, and the challenging radio
communication noises. Second, we select four typical accents from the CommonV oice [ 1] dataset,

highlighted in red. Variance indicates the stability of different scores. “NCE” denotes normalized
cross-entropy, where a higher value indicates better measure quality (more results are in Fig. 5).

including African, Australian, Indian, and Singaporean accents. Finally, we also evaluate our approach
under some specific scenarios, including BBC talks (LRS2 [ 13]), TED talks (TED-LIUM 3 [ 29]),
telephone conversation (SwitchBoard [ 25]), interview conversation (CORAAL [ 43]), and airline
information consultation (ATIS [28]). More details about the datasets are presented in Appendix F.
4.2 Configurations
We use the Whisper-Large-V3 model for main experiments, which contains 1.5 billion parameters
trained on 680k-hour web-scale data. It is fine-tuned using Adam optimizer [ 45] with an initial
learning rate of 1e−5for 2 epochs. The batch size is set to 1 with 16 gradient accumulation steps. For
hyper-parameters, the threshold λis set to 2 and the temperature τis 10. In addition, the percentile α
of utterance-level filtering is 20, which shows consistent effectiveness across different datasets.
5 Results and Analysis
5.1 Effectiveness of STAR
To examine the effectiveness of STAR, we conduct comparative experiments across various domains
and report the WER results in Table 1.
Main Results. From noise adaptation results on CHiME-4, LS-FreeSound, and RATS, we observe
that: (i) STAR enhances Whisper in all noise scenarios, reducing the WER up to 24.9% relatively.
Specifically, on the challenging RATS dataset with pseudo labels of a 46.9% WER, our STAR can
still produce a 4.9% relative improvement. (ii) For some domains, e.g., “ airport ” and “ car”, STAR
can even approach the upper-bound performance by supervised learning. This demonstrates that
even with unlabeled data only, our method can effectively adapt Whisper to specific target domains.
From results on other domains, we observe that: (i) STAR consistently improves the accented ASR to
approach the supervised upper bound. (ii) Whisper does not perform well in some colloquial scenarios
(SwitchBoard andCORAAL ) as the spoken language tends to be informal and less grammatically
correct, which leads to poor-quality pseudo labels and then influences our adaptation performance.
Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting. Table 2 analyzes the potential forgetting issue of our method
by evaluating the CHiME-4 -finetuned model on other datasets. Surprisingly, contrary to the common
catastrophic forgetting issue that commonly happens in traditional source-free ASR adaptation, our
STAR approach can even improve the performance in other domains. We speculate that under the
self-training scheme, the pseudo label is generated by the model itself, so that it may avoid the model
from over-fitting to samples with vastly different data distributions [ 10]. Furthermore, compared to
vanilla self-training, STAR can better highlight the high-quality pseudo tokens for informed finetuning ,
which may help improve the model’s general ASR ability. More detailed analysis are in §E.

Figure 3: WER (%) results with different numbers of unlabeled training samples. The minimum
required data amount (in hours) to obtain the best performance is highlighted in the star mark.
Analysis of Indicators. Table 1 also presents the performance of different indicators in the informed
finetuning . First, we observe that the utterance-level filtering yields some effects by removing bad
training samples. Then, for token-level re-weighting, the two pseudo-label quality indicators both
improve the performance, where the attentive score performs better due to higher reliability. Our
proposed STAR indicator achieves the best result by integrating the strengths of both scores. We also
use a case in Table 3 to illustrate, where exists a wrong pseudo token “teams”. The confidence score
fails to reflect this error while the attentive score succeeds, but the latter suffers from less numerical
stability (i.e., large variance). By integrating their strengths, our STAR score achieves both reliability
and stability in assessing the pseudo-label’s quality. In addition, we also calculate the NCE metric to
show the better quality of our proposed STAR and attentive scores than traditional confidence scores.
5.2 Generality of STAR
Generalization to Different Speech Foundation Models. To further evaluate the generalization abil-
ity of our approach, we extend STAR to different foundation models, including OWSM, Canary and
Parakeet-TDT that take top places in the HuggingFace ASR leader-board2. Consistent performance
gains (i.e., over 10% relative WER reduction) on these models has verified the excellent generality of
STAR. In addition, it also works well on relatively small models like Whisper-Medium.en-0.8B.
Generalization to Speech Translation (ST) Task. Apart from ASR, we also investigate another
widely studied speech task, the ST task, to further verify the generality of STAR adaptation. As
shown in Table 5, results on various FLEURS X →En tracks illustrate an average of over 1.2 BLEU
improvements (2.2 BLEU for De →En). It shows the good potential of our STAR adaptation on other
sequence-to-sequence tasks besides ASR, which could lead to more extensions for future work.
5.3 Ablation Study
In this section, we conduct ablation studies to analyze STAR from perspectives of data (Fig. 3), model
(Table 9), and finetuning approaches (Table 10), which provide a constructive reference for deploying
ASR foundation models in practical scenarios using STAR. More analysis are in Appendix E.
Data Efficiency. We explore the requirement of unlabeled data amount ( Nt′) for STAR adaptation.
Fig. 3 shows the WER results on four datasets with different numbers of training utterances. Surpris-
ingly, only 200 to 500 sentences (less than 1-hour unlabeled speech data) are required to achieve the
optimal effects, which cost around 0.8-hour training time on single NVIDIA-A100-40GB GPU. This
remarkable data efficiency significantly saves the labours in real-world applications: not only is there
no need for manual labelling, but the collection of unlabeled data also requires less than one hour.
Model Size. Table 9 reports the performance on CHiME-4 test-real that applies STAR to the Whisper
family with different model sizes. Results show that our STAR adaptation works well on difference
scales of foundation models. Specifically, the promising performance gains on light model (base.en)
implicates the potential of STAR in practical resource-constrained conditions, such as mobile devices.
Finetuning Approach. Considering that adapting speech foundation models with a small amount
of data might risk over-fitting, we explore the impact of different finetuning approaches in Table 10.
We observe that both regular finetuning (full, encoder-only, decoder-only) and efficient finetuning
methods (LoRA) yield similar effectiveness, which provides flexible choices under different settings.

96 Conclusion
We propose STAR, a source-free UDA method that effectively adapts the speech foundation models to
various target domains with unlabeled data. Specifically, STAR introduces a novel indicator to assess
the pseudo-label quality and then instructively guide the finetuning of the model. Our experiments
verify STAR’s efficacy on ASR tasks across a wide range of target domains including noise, accent,
and specific scenarios, and it even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation
on some corpora. Furthermore, we observe that STAR can avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem
that is often suffered by models adapted without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR
only requires less than one hour of unlabeled data to achieve an average of 13.5% relative WER
reduction across 14 domains, and it also shows seamless generality to speech translation tasks. This
enables us to deploy speech systems in real-world scenarios rapidly and conveniently.

A Additional Discussions on the Design of the STAR Framework
Question 1 : Is the proposed STAR method limited to the Whisper model only?
STAR is a general source-free UDA method that can be compatible with any attention-based speech
foundation model. To validate this, we also use several other models in our experiments, including
15OWSM-V3.1-1.0B [ 68]3, Canary-1.0B4, Parakeet-TDT-1.1B5, and SeamlessM4T-V2-2.3B [ 4]6.
Table 4 verify the effective generalization ability of our STAR adaptation method on various state-of-
the-art ASR foundation models7. Furthermore, we also employ the speech translation foundation
model SeamlessM4T to verify our generality. Table 6 presents the WER results on CHiME-4 test sets
with SeamlessM4T, where the STAR adaptation achieves significant improvements over zero-shot
and self-training baselines, which even approaches the supervised upper bound. We observed that
although the performance of SeamlessM4T-Large-V2 is slightly worse than Whisper Large-V3 on
ASR task, STAR can still achieve up to a 30.7% WER reduction that improves its noise robustness.
Table 6: WER (%) results of STAR with latest speech foundation model, SeamlessM4T-Large-V2 [ 4],
on CHiME-4 test sets.
Test Set Baseline Self-train. STAR (ours) Real label
test-real 12.3 11.5 9.1−26.0% 8.7
test-simu 15.2 15.0 13.2−13.2% 13.0
dev-real 8.8 8.3 6.1−30.7% 5.8
dev-simu 11.4 11.0 9.2−19.3% 9.0
Question 2 : Can STAR be applied to smaller or streaming ASR models like WavLM, RNN-T?
STAR requires large speech models to possess universal robustness across various domains to fulfill
their role as a reliable pseudo-labeler, where domain-specific ASR models like WavLM and RNN-T
may not work well. To illustrate, the WavLM-Conformer ASR baseline [ 11] achieves the state-of-
the-art result on the LibriSpeech test-clean dataset (with a WER of only 1.8%). However, when
facing domain shifts, such as the CHiME-4 noisy dataset, its zero-shot performance drops to 14.4%,
and it exceeds 20% on the CommonV oice accented dataset. Under these circumstances, it is nearly
impossible to use only unlabeled data to adapt this model to the Whisper’s zero-shot performance
(5 7% WER). Therefore, we argue that adding such baselines is not of much reference value. As more
general-purpose speech foundation models are released, we prefer to focus our research on studying
their decoding behaviors to adapt them more efficiently and conveniently to specific task domains.
Table 4 and 6 provide more results on CHiME-4 dataset with more speech foundation models (i.e.,
OWSM, Canary, Parakeet, SeamlessM4T) to show the good generality of STAR.
Question 3 : Is the proposed STAR method limited to the ASR task?
Our proposed STAR approach is compatible with any tasks using attention-based encoder-decoder
architecture with auto-regressive decoding , the most prevalent framework in many areas not limited
to speech and language. Therefore, we believe this work provides useful insights to researchers
from other communities who use similar model architectures and need to assess the quality of auto-
regressive decoders, such as speech translation, audio/image captioning. Table 5 presents the strong
results of STAR on speech translation task, which verifies its task generality. However, since this work
focuses on ASR task, we would like to leave the evaluation on more tasks to future work. In addition,
recent research on LLMs [ 36] also focuses on the unsmooth self-attention matrix like Fig. 2, where
they successfully alleviate the LLMs’ hallucination problem in auto-regressive decoding through this
observation. This evidence indicates the potential impact of our method on other communities.
Question 4 : What is the difference between STAR with the existing self-training method in ASR?
We summarize the vital difference in the following two points:
•Prior works focus on adapting from one source domain to a single target domain (e.g., clean
to noisy [ 58]), whereas STAR leverages the universality of Whisper to explore one-to-many
domain adaptation. Although the domain mismatch issue in the latter approach is less severe
than in the former, we argue that the baseline performance of the latter is significantly better
than that of the former, making improvements more challenging to achieve.

6https://huggingface.co/facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large
7https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard
16•Although both of them are auto-regressive processes, the decoding of speech foundation
models exhibits partially distinct characteristics compared with vanilla ASR decoders in
previous works, such as over-confidence phenomena [ 37]. Therefore, STAR adopts an
empirical indicator of quality derived from the decoding features of speech foundation
models, which can more effectively guide the subsequent finetuning process.
Question 5 : What is the scope of efficacy when applying STAR adaptation?
As shown in Table 1, STAR can improve the performance with zero-shot WER ranging from 2.9%
(car) to 46.9% (radio). However, we observe that the WER improvement in RATS mainly stems
from the adjustment of some prepositions and articles, which may not improve the comprehensibility
of recognition results fundamentally. Therefore, collecting labeled data for supervised learning is
inevitable when the scenarios are quite challenging.
Question 6 : Can STAR be involved in adapting test data?
We observe that some works perform unsupervised domain adaptation using unlabeled test data.
However, STAR only accesses test data once, and the unlabeled target domain data is drawn from
the training set of corresponding corpus. We argue this setting more closely aligns with practical
scenarios: developers cannot access the test set during the adaptation process. However, they can
conveniently collect small amount (see data efficiency in Fig. 3) of unlabeled target-domain speech
for adaptation, and then deploy the adapted model in testing environments.
Question 7 : What about the broader impacts of this work?
This work supports rapid and convenient deployment of ASR applications in real-world scenarios,
which poses positive societal impact. During training process, we only use publicly available data and
pre-trained models, so that our work will not pose explicit negative impact. One thing worth noting is
that, our algorithm shows good generality and thus might cause abuse in some special occasions (e.g.,
confidential), we will release code carefully under strict licenses and rules to avoid negative impact.
Question 8 : What about the limitations of this work?
Our approach is designed specifically for Transformer-based speech foundation models, so that it
may not handle the cases beyond the foundation models, e.g., the unseen languages, unseen tasks,
extremely adverse conditions, etc.
B Visualization of Speech Domains Distinction
Fig. 4 visualizes the spectrograms of parallel clean and noisy speech samples. We can observe clear
speech patterns in the clean spectrogram (i), while they are significantly contaminated by noise in
the noisy spectrograms (ii) and (iii). Specifically, the babble noise corrupts speech signals more
than airport noise, where speech patterns are almost completely removed. The reason is babble
noise contains human speech and thus of sample type as an original speech signal, resulting in more
significant corruption. These two kinds of noisy speech are reported in Table 1. Overall, the domains
of clean and noisy speech are quite distinct from the perspective of pattern recognition.
(i) Clean (ii) Airport 0dB (iii) Babble 0dB
Figure 4: Spectrograms of parallel clean and noisy speech samples, where we select two noise types
for visualization, i.e., airport station and babble (used in our experiments). The speech samples are
selected from the LS-FreeSound test set, and the sample ID is “1089-134686-0003”.
17C More Discussions of Pseudo-label Quality Indicators
Fig. 5 presents more investigations of the quality indicators. First, from the confusion matrix we
can observe the higher reliability of the attentive score over the confidence score, which has been
discussed in Section 5.1, and our proposed STAR score maintains the high reliability of the attentive
score by sophisticated integration. Then, from the variance statistics we can observe that the attentive
score suffers from less numerical stability, while our proposed STAR score benefits from the high
stability of the confidence score. As a result, the STAR score provides a both reliable and stable
indicator of the quality of the pseudo label. Furthermore, we note that after STAR adaptation, the
Whisper model can produce higher-quality pseudo labels, which not only verifies its effectiveness but
also explains its potential for iterative adaptation (see Section E).

tokens, i.e., correct and wrong, and the x-axis denotes whether the corresponding score is high or low.
Since all scores are normalized via divided by mean value, we set 1 as the threshold to separate them
into large and small groups, where more thresholds are analyzed in Fig. 6. NCE is a statistical metric
to measure the quality of confidence measure, where higher value indicates better measurement.
D More Discussion on Utterance-level filtering
Beam search decoding is a widely used strategy in sequence-to-sequence decoding, which expands
the search space to obtain an N-best hypotheses list. Recent research on speech foundation models
shows that N-best results contain rich information [ 8,88], where the diversity can reflect the final
WER performance [ 34,6]. Specifically, we utilize the beam search decoding as a replacement
for Gaussian disturbance and obtain an N-best hypotheses list for diversity calculation. The best
hypotheses and beam size Nare respectively viewed as base transcription ˆyandK, and the quality
of utterance Uis calculated in the same manner as Eq.(9). Furthermore, we also introduce an earlier
method from conventional ASR, consensus decoding [ 61], as an alternative to investigate the role of

utterance-level filtering approach, where the utterance quality is estimated similar to the beam search
decoding.
Table 8 presents the ablation study of utterance-level filtering strategy. First, we compare the K-
hypotheses by Gaussian disturbance with the N-best hypotheses by beam search decoding and
consensus decoding, where we observe that the former performs a little better than the latter two.
Therefore, we employ Gaussian disturbance for utterance-level filtering in the main experiments.
Finally, we investigate the role of utterance-level filtering in the entire STAR adaptation, where the
results demonstrate its contribution in the final performance gains (second last column).

E Additional Ablation Study
Following Section 5.3, here we would like to present more details about the ablation study on model
size and finetuning approaches. In addition, we also observe that our STAR method can further
improve the performance with multiple-round iterative adaptation.
Model Size. Table 9 reports the performance on CHiME-4 test-real that applies STAR to the Whisper
family with different model sizes. We can observe consistent and significant improvements on
different scales of Whisper models. Specifically, although the light model (base.en) exhibits poor
noise robustness, our STAR can bring 45.4% relative improvement. It indicates the potential value of
STAR adaptation in practical resource-constrained conditions, such as mobile devices.
Finetuning Approach. Considering that training large speech models with a small amount of
data might risk over-fitting, we explore the impact of different tuning approaches for the informed
finetuning process in this experiment. From Table 10, we observe that (i) freezing part of parameters
can not improve the performance of STAR adaptation. However, finetuning the decoder only is the

optimal strategy for supervised adaptation. (ii) Using less trainable parameters, LoRA tuning shows
commendable results with full finetuning. Nevertheless, LoRA introduces further hyper-parameters
(e.g., rank) and we found it is sensitive to the learning rate. Considering it slightly decreases the
inference efficiency, LoRA tuning is recommended only in situations with limited training resources.
Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting. Following Table 2, we present more results regarding the
forgetting issue on Whisper-Medium.en-0.8B and SeamlessM4T-V2-2.3B in Table 11. We observe
that our STAR can prevent the catastrophic forgetting problem on different-scale speech foundation
models. As for the potential reasons, we analyze from three points. First, we observe that the vanilla
self-training scheme can also well mitigate the forgetting problem. We can gain some inspiration
from previous work [ 10] for analysis. Since the pseudo label is generated by the model itself, it may
not force the model heavily to over-fit any external data distributions, so that self-training does not
degrade the out-of-domain performance. On the other hand, current prevalent foundation models are
usually trained by multi-task learning, where not all model capacities are used for ASR. Therefore,
specific self-training for ASR task may help mitigate the forgetting problem within ASR though
with different domains. Furthermore, compared to vanilla self-training, our STAR shows even better
performance. The core contribution of STAR is the novel quality indicator that can better highlight
the high-quality pseudo tokens for informed finetuning . Considering ASR tasks in different domains,
the high-quality pseudo tokens usually correspond to speech frames that are relatively high-quality
and easy to recognize. Therefore, highlighting the weights of such pseudo tokens may avoid bringing
in low-quality knowledge that may conflict with the existing knowledge embedded in the parameters
of the pre-trained speech foundation models, and thus prevent the catastrophic forgetting problem.
More study is expected for a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind it. Considering the focus
of this work as well as the space limit, we would like to leave this study to future work.
Iterability of STAR. As a self-training approach, STAR is iterable by repeating the process of
pseudo-labeling and informed finetuning. Table 12 reports the WER results with different numbers of
iterations using different model sizes and test sets. In most test sets, multiple iterations of STAR result
in further performance improvements. This indicates that while learning from pseudo labels, errors
also accumulate, thereby limiting the upper-bound of self-training. Additionally, the enhancement of
iteration is relatively larger in smaller models, e.g., 0.7% further WER reduction on Whisper-base.
F Dataset Domain Details
For dataset selection, our goal is to cover common scenarios of ASR tasks, which can be grouped
into three categories, i.e., background noise, speaker accents, and specific scenarios. Consequently,
we collect and employ the following datasets with evident domain characteristics to evaluate our
proposed approach. In addition, considering our proposed STAR adaptation is built on self-attention
matrix that focuses on global contextual correspondence, we filter out short utterances (i.e., with less
than 5 tokens) in some datasets for better and more efficient evaluation.

and noise data from FreeSound dataset [ 22] at SNRs of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 dB to simulate the
noisy speech data. We randomly select 5,000 long utterances (i.e., with more than 5 tokens) from
them as the target-domain unlabeled training data. For test set, they select 118 clean speech samples
from LibriSpeech test-clean split and mix them with FreeSound noise at SNRs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20
dB, where we select three noise types (i.e., babble, airport, car) at 0 dB for main experiments.
21RATS [26]: The Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) dataset contains radio-
communication speech in the ultra high-frequency data category that is extremely noisy and chal-
lenging for ASR tasks. Its training data contains 43,112 noisy speech utterances, where we filter out
the low-quality samples and randomly select 5,000 long samples as training set. Its test set contains
7,591 utterances, where we randomly select 1,000 long samples for higher evaluation efficiency.
F.2 Speaker Accents
CommonVoice [1]: CommonV oice 5.1 is a freely available dataset for speech recognition. It
contains speech recordings from diverse speakers in over 60 languages. In this work, we employ the
English speech data in four different accents, including African, Australian, Indian, and Singaporean.
Specifically, we randomly select 7,885 long samples from its train-en split with accent labels, where
the training set contains 7,485 samples (1,902/2,000/2,000/1,583 for each accent) and the test set
contains 400 samples (100 for each accent). In our experiments, the model is finetuned on the entire
training set and then evaluated on each accent individually.
F.3 Specific Scenarios
TED-LIUM 3 [29]: TED-LIUM 3 is a dataset of speech recorded from TED Talks in multiple
languages. It contains a diverse range of background noise, speaker accents, speech topics, etc. To
better evaluate our method, we randomly select 6,000 long samples from its train split for our main
experiments, where the training set contains 5,000 samples and the test set contains 1,000 samples.
SwitchBoard [25]: The SwitchBoard corpus is a telephone speech dataset collected from conver-
sations between pairs of speakers. It focuses on North American English and involves over 2.4k
conversations from approximately 200 speakers. We randomly select 5,000 long samples from its
train split as the training data, and use its eval2000 split as the test data.
LRS2 [13]: Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) is a large-scale publicly available labeled audio-visual
dataset, which consists of 224 hours of video clips from BBC programs. We randomly select 6,000
long samples from its train split for our main experiments, where the training set contains 5,000
samples and the test set contains 1,000 samples.
ATIS [28]: Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) is a dataset comprising spoken queries for
air travel information, such as flight times, prices, and availability. It contains 3,964 samples in the
training set and 809 samples in the test set, which are recorded from over 500 speakers.
CORAAL [43]: The Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) is the first
public corpus of AAL data. It includes audio recordings along with the time-aligned orthographic
transcription from over 150 sociolinguistic interviews. We randomly select 2,950 long samples as the
training set and 500 samples as the test set.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 1.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Appendix A.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
23•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 3 and 4, Appendix F and G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
24(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the code in supplemental material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/pu
blic/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 3 and 4, Appendix F and G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
25Answer: [No]
Justification: Our experimental results are stable and do not need such statistical significance.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 4 and 5.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed and conformed with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
26Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Appendix A.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section F.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
27• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have well documented the introduced assets in supplemental material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
28Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
