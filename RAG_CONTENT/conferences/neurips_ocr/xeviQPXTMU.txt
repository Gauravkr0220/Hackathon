Abstract
Federated graph learning (FedGL) is an emerging learning paradigm to collabora-
tively train graph data from various clients. However, during the development and
deployment of FedGL models, they are susceptible to illegal copying and model
theft. Backdoor-based watermarking is a well-known method for mitigating these
attacks, as it offers ownership verification to the model owner. We take the first
step to protect the ownership of FedGL models via backdoor-based watermarking.
Existing techniques have challenges in achieving the goal: 1) they either cannot
be directly applied or yield unsatisfactory performance; 2) they are vulnerable to
watermark removal attacks; and 3) they lack of formal guarantees. To address all
the challenges, we propose FedGMark , the first certified robust backdoor-based wa-
termarking for FedGL. FedGMark leverages the unique graph structure and client
information in FedGL to learn customized and diverse watermarks. It also designs
a novel GL architecture that facilitates defending against both the empirical and the-
oretically worst-case watermark removal attacks. Extensive experiments validate
the promising empirical and provable watermarking performance of FedGMark .

1 Introduction
Federated Graph Learning (FedGL) [Xie et al. , 2021; Wang et al. , 2022a; Tan et al. , 2023; Yao et al. ,
2024] leverages a server and multiple clients to collaboratively train GL methods [Kipf and Welling,
2017; Hamilton et al. , 2017] via federated learning (FL) [McMahan et al. , 2017; Li et al. , 2021;
Karimireddy et al. , 2020]. In recent years, FedGL has attracted increasing interest in domains such as
disease prediction [Peng et al. , 2022], recommendation systems [Baek et al. , 2023; Wu et al. , 2022;
Liet al. , 2022b], and molecular classification [He et al. , 2022]. In addition, several industries have
deployed/open-sourced their FedGL frameworks, such as Alibaba’s FederatedScope-GNN [Wang et
al., 2022b] and Amazon’s FedML-GNN [Vidya et al.]. However, FedGL models are typically left
unprotected, rendering them vulnerable to threats like illegal copying, model theft, and malicious
distribution. For instance, a business competitor may replicate a model to gain competitive advantages
or a malicious user may sell the model for profits. These threats waste the model owner’s investment
(e.g., labor costs, time, and energy) and infringe upon the legitimate copyrights of the model.
Backdoor-based watermarking [Uchida et al. , 2017; Adi et al. , 2018; Bansal et al. , 2022] is a de
facto model ownership verification technique to mitigate the above threats. This technique typically
consists of two steps: 1) Embedding the target model with a watermark. The model owner injects a
specific backdoor trigger (i.e., watermark) into some clean samples and trains the target model with

this watermarked data along with the remaining clean data. Then the trained target (watermarked)
model could have both high watermark accuracy (i.e., accurately classify testing data with the same
watermark as the owner desires) and main task accuracy (i.e., accurately classify clean testing data).
2) Model ownership verification. When suspecting the target model is illegally used by others, the
model owner can recruit a trusted third party for model ownership verification. Particularly, the true
model owner knows how the target model behaves as expected by providing the trusted third party
the carefully designed watermarked data, while the illegal parties cannot do so. Notice that, since all
the clients have devoted computation and data to the training, they have a strong intention to jointly
protect their ownership of the model.
In this paper, we aim to protect the ownership of FedGL models via backdoor-based watermarking.
We observe backdoor-based watermarking methods for protecting the ownership of FL model on
non-graph data [Li et al. , 2022a; Tekgul et al. , 2021; Shao et al. , 2022; Yang et al. , 2023; Lansari
et al. , 2023] or centralized GL model on graph data [Xu et al. , 2023] have been recently developed.
However, applying these methods for protecting FedGL models faces challenges and weaknesses.
•Inapplicable or ineffective: Existing methods for non-graph data cannot be directly applied for
graph data. For instance, they require input data have same size, while graphs can have varying
sizes; they are unable to consider the connectivity information such as edges connecting nodes
in the graph data. The only method for graph data [Xu et al. , 2023] uses a naive random graph
(e.g., generated by the ER model [Gilbert, 1959]) as a watermark. Extending this watermark
from centralized GL to FedGL models exhibits unsatisfactory performance , as shown in Table 1.
For instance, the watermark accuracy is less than 60% in all the studied graph datasets and
FedGL models. The core reason is the random graph watermark does not use any graph structure
information or client information that are unique in FedGL.
•Vulnerable to watermark removal attacks: They are vulnerable to existing watermark removal
techniques such as distillation and finetuning [Bansal et al. , 2022] (more details in Section 2.3). For
instance, as illustrated in Table 1, distillation can reduce the watermark accuracy to less than 30%.
•Lack or weak formal guarantees: All these methods do not provide formal robustness guarantees
against watermark removal attacks. This could make them even vulnerable to more advanced
attacks. For instance, our proposed layer-perturbation attack can further reduce the watermark
accuracy, e.g., perturbing only 1-layer parameters of the watermarked model yields only 10%
watermark accuracy (while main accuracy is marginally affected). Bansal et al. [2022] proposed
the first certified watermark for centralized non-graph learning models against l2model parameter
perturbation. However, its certified radius is only 1.2, meaning the l2norm of a (usually million-
dimensional) perturbation vector cannot exceed 1.2 to maintain the watermark accuracy.
We address all the above issues by proposing a certified robust backdoor-based watermark method for
FedGL, called FedGMark .2FedGMark enjoys several properties: 1) Its designed watermarks can
handle varying size graphs and utilize both graph structure and client information unique in FedGL
models; 2) It is empirically robust to both existing watermark removal attacks and the proposed layer-
perturbation attack; and 3) more importantly, it is provably robust to the layer-perturbation attack (the
layer parameters can be arbitrarily perturbed), when the number of the perturbed layers is bounded.
2In typical FL, a server and multiple clients collaboratively train a global model stored in the server, which
is used by all clients for their tasks. Accordingly, in our ownership verification problem in FedGL, all clients
design their own watermark data and collaboratively train the watermarked global model, which is for joint
ownership by all participating clients. Note that we do not consider the case where the clients did not participate
in watermark training, but claim the ownership of the model (actually these clients do not know how to do so).
2Figure 1: Overall pipeline of the proposed certified watermarks.
Specifically, as depicted in Figure 1, FedGMark consists of two modules: 1) Customized Watermark
Generator (CWG) : it learns the customized watermark for individual graphs and clients in FedGL, by
integrating the edge information from the client graphs and the unique key features of the clients.
CWG can significantly enhance the diversity and effectiveness of the generated watermarks. 2) Robust
Model Loader (RML) . RML designs a new GL model that consists of multiple submodels, where
each submodel can be any existing GL model. It also introduces a voting classifier for assembling the
submodels’ predictions. Such a design can facilitate deriving the certified watermark performance
against the (worst-case) layer-perturbation attack.
We evaluate FedGMark on four real-world graph datasets (MUTAG, PROTEINS, DD, and COLLAB)
and three FedGL models including Fed-GIN, Fed-GSAGE, and Fed-GCN, whose base GL models
are GIN [Xu et al. , 2019], GSAGE [Hamilton et al. , 2017], and GCN [Kipf and Welling, 2017],
respectively. Extensive experimental results show FedGMark achieves high main accuracy and
watermark accuracy under no attacks and watermark removal attacks, high certified watermark
accuracy, and significantly outperforms the existing method. Such good results demonstrate the
potential of FedGMark as a watermarking method to protect the ownership of FedGL models.
We summarize our main contributions of this paper as follows:
• To our best knowledge, this is the first work to protect the ownership of emerging FedGL models.
• We propose a certifiably robust backdoor-based watermarking method FedGMark for FedGL.
•We validate the effectiveness of FedGMark in multiple FedGL models and real-world graph datasets
under no attack, existing backdoor removal attacks, and worst-case layer-perturbation attacks.
2 PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Federated Graph Learning (FedGL)
Given a graph G= (V,E)as input, a GL model for graph classification learns a graph classifier f
that outputs a label f(G) =y∈Yfor a graph. Here, V,E,Yrepresent the set of nodes, edges, and
labels, respectively. A∈ {0,1}|V|×|V|is the binary adjacency matrix of G, where A[vj, vk] = 1 if
there exists an edge between nodes vjandvk, and 0otherwise, with |V|the total number of nodes.
FedGL employs FL techniques [McMahan et al. , 2017] to collaboratively train GL models with a
set of (e.g., T) clients T={1,···, T}and a server. Assuming each client i∈Thas a set of graphs
Gi, we illustrate the training process of FedGL using the e-th epoch as an example: 1) Initially, the
server distributes the global model parameters θeto a randomly selected subset of clients Te, where
Te⊆T. 2) Upon receiving θe, each client itrains its local model parameter θi
ewith its own graphs
Giand updates its model parameters via SGD, i.e., θi
e=θi
e−1−η∂θeL(θe;Gi), where L(θe;Gi)
represents a loss function, e.g., cross-entropy loss. After training, client isubmits its update model
parameters θi
eto the server. 3) The server aggregates local model parameters of the selected clients
i.e.,{θi
e:i∈Te}and updates the global model parameter, e.g., θe+1=1
|Te|P
i∈Teθi
evia the average
aggregation [McMahan et al. , 2017], for the next epoch. This iterative process continues until the
global model converges or reaches the maximum number of epochs.
2.2 Backdoor-based Watermarking for GL
Backdoor-based watermarking [Uchida et al. , 2017; Adi et al. , 2018; Bansal et al. , 2022; Xu et al. ,
2023] adopts the idea of backdoor attack [Bagdasaryan et al. , 2020; Wang et al. , 2020; Saha et al. ,
2020] from the adversarial realm to facilitate model ownership verification. To watermark the GL
3model, assume the model owner has a set of clean graphs Gand selects a subset of graphs Gw⊂G
to inject the watermark. In the existing method [Xu et al. , 2023], the model owner first generates
a random graph (e.g., via the ER-model) as the watermark for each to-be-watermarked graph. For
instance, for a graph G∈Gwwith label y, the generated random graph is Gs(its size is often smaller
thanG). The owner then attaches GstoGto produce the watermarked graph Gw, where nodes in
Gare randomly chosen and the edge status of these nodes are replaced by edges in Gs. Finally, the
owner assigns a desired label different from ytoGw. The watermarked graphs together with the
clean graphs are used to train the GL model. During model ownership verification, the one who can
predict a high accuracy on these watermarked graphs can claim to be the model owner.
We note this method can be extended to watermark FedGL models, where each client can generate
its own random graphs as the watermark and train its local model with the watermarked graphs and
clean graphs. The server then aggregates the watermarked local models to update the global model.
2.3 Watermark Removal Attacks
We consider three possible watermark removal attacks aiming to infringe the FedGL model ownership:
distillation and finetuning from [Shafieinejad et al. , 2021], and our proposed layer-perturbation attack.
In all attacks, the attacker (e.g., malicious user) is assumed to know the target watermarked model.
1) Distillation. This attack has access to some unlabeled data sampled from the same data distribution.
To remove watermarks without affecting the target model’s main task performance, the attacker uses
the unlabeled data to distill the target model during training. Specifically, the attacker initializes
its model with the target model and labels the unlabeled data by querying the target model. The
attacker’s model is then updated with these unlabeled data and their predicted labels.
2) Finetuning. This attack assumes the attacker has some labeled data. The attacker then leverages
the labeled data to further finetune the target model in order to forget the watermark. This attack is
shown to pose a greater threat than the distillation attack [Bansal et al. , 2022].
3) Layer-perturbation attack. This attack also assumes the attacker has some labeled data. As
knowing the target watermarked model (and hence the architecture), the attacker can mimic training
an unwatermarked model with the same architecture as the target model using the labeled data. To
further test the model robustness, we assume the attacker also knows some true watermarked samples,
similar to [Jiang et al. , 2023]. Then, the attacker can replace anylayer(s)’ parameters of the target
model with those from the unwatermarked model to maximally reduce the watermark accuracy on its
watermarked samples, while maintaining the main task performance. Our results (e.g., in Table 1)
show this layer-perturbation attack (even only perturbing 1 layer parameters) is much more effective
than the other two attacks (even though the whole model parameters can be perturbed).
2.4 Threat Model
We follow existing methods [Shafieinejad et al. , 2021; Bansal et al. , 2022; Xu et al. , 2023; Jiang et
al., 2023], where the adversary is assumed to know all details of the pretrained watermarked FedGL
model, but does not tamper with the training process. This means all clients and the server are benign
and follow the federated training protocol, and the attack happens at the testing/inference time. We
highlight this is in stark contrast to the training-time Byzantine attack on FL where some clients are
malicious and they manipulate the training process.
Attacker’s knowledge. The attacker has white-box access to the pretrained watermarked FedGL
model. In addition, the attacker may also know some clean (unlabeled or labeled) training data,
as well as watermarked data. Note that this setting actually makes our defense design the most
challenging. If the defense can successfully defend against the strongest white-box attack on the
watermarked FedGL model, it will also be effective against weaker attacks, such as black-box attacks.
Attacker’s capability. The attacker can modify the pretrained model via leveraging its white-box
access to the trained model and its hold training and watermarked data. For instance, the attacker
can finetune the pretrained model via the labeled training data. More details of the capabilities of
considered attacks are described in Section 2.3.
Attacker’s goal. The attacker aims to remove the watermark based on its knowledge and capability,
while maintaining the model utility. This allows it to illegally use the model without detection.
43 FedGMark: Our Certified Robust Watermark for FedGL
3.1 Motivation and Overview
Recall that the random graph based watermark is unable to ensure high watermark accuracy for
protecting FedGL (as shown in Table 1). This is because such random watermark does not use any
graph structure or client information during FedGL training. Our results also show this method is
vulnerable to the three watermark removal attacks. These weaknesses inspire us to design a more
effective and robust watermarking method specially for FedGL model ownership verification.
We propose FedGMark , the first certified robust backdoor-based watermarking method for FedGL.
FedGMark comprises two main components: Customized Watermark Generator (CWG) andRobust
Model Loader (RML) (as depicted in Figure 1). The CWG module utilizes the unique property of
each client, as different clients could have different properties (e.g., distributions of their graph data)
and their optimal watermark could be different. Particularly, CWG learns the customized watermark
for each graph using its structure information, and outputs a set of diversified watermarked graphs for
each client. Further, inspired by existing GNNs [Xu et al. , 2019], the RML module designs a new
GL model that consists of multiple submodels, each being any existing GL model. It also introduces
a voting classifier for aggregating the prediction results from the submodels. Under this design,
FedGMark can be proved to be certified robust against the worst-case layer-perturbation attack, once
the number of perturbed layers is bounded. The model owner (e.g., participating clients in FedGL)
adopts the designed GL model to train the local watermarked model with the learnt watermarked
graphs and the remaining clean graphs. After the server-client training terminates, the ownership of
the trained FedGL model can be verified via measuring its performance on a set of testing graphs
injected with the global watermark , which is the integration of all clients’ local watermarks.
3.2 Customized Watermark Generator (CWG)
CWG consists of two networks: GatingNet andKeyNet .GatingNet designs the watermark for
each graph separately using the edge information, while KeyNet learns client-wise watermarking
style using predefined keys (e.g., client ID in this paper). The customized watermark for each client’s
graph is then decided using the output of GatingNet andKeyNet .Detailed network architectures
of CWG can be seen in Table 7 in Appendix C. We demonstrate how CWG can learn a customized
watermark using a graph Gi= (Vi,Ei)from client ias an instance. The details are as follows:
•We first randomly select nwnodesVi
w={v1,···, vnw}fromVias watermark nodes and construct
a corresponding mask matrix Mi∈ {0,1}|Vi|×|Vi|such that Mi[vj, vk] = 1 ifvj, vk∈Vi
w, and 0
otherwise. We also update the adjacency matrix AiofGiaccording to Vi
w, i.e., setting Ai[vj, vk] =
0,∀vj, vk∈Vi
w. This allows us focus on learning the edge status between watermarked nodes.
•Given the client i’s ID string ki, we utilize a cryptographic hash function, such as MD5, to convert it
into an integer (e.g., 128-bit long with the integer range [0,2128−1]). This integer is then employed
as a seed to produce a key matrix Ki∈R|Vi|×|Vi|. Then, we employ GatingNet andKeyNet
to extract edge features and key features, resulting in ˜Ai= GatingNet( Ai)∈[0,1]|Vi|×|Vi|and
˜Ki= KeyNet( Ki)∈[0,1]|Vi|×|Vi|, respectively.
•We finally learn the customized watermark for Giby integrating ˜Ai,˜Ki, andMi, and obtain
the corresponding watermarked graph as Gi
w= (Vi,Ei
w). Here Ei
wis the set of edges according
to the updated adjacency matrix Ai⊕Wi, where ⊕is the element-wise addition and Wi=
I((˜Ai⊙˜Ki)>0.5)⊙Micontains the edge status between the watermark nodes Vi
w. Here, ⊙is
the element-wise product, I(p)is an indicator function returning 1ifpis true, and 0otherwise. We
adopt 0.5as a threshold to decide the presence of edges between watermarked nodes.
3.3 Robust Model Loader (RML)
This module aims to design a new GL model that is provably robust to the layer-perturbation attack.
Towards this end, we design a GL model architecture to incorporate multiple submodels; and devise
a majority voting-based ensemble classifier on top of the predictions of these submodels.
Architecture of the proposed GL model. Intuitively, each client can take a base GL model (e.g.,
GIN [Xu et al. , 2019]) and split it according to the layer indexes to obtain multiple submodels. For
instance, a 8-layer GIN can be represented with layer indexes {l1,···, l8}. Splitting this GIN into 4
submodels {GIN 1,···,GIN 4}with layer indexes {l1, l2},···,{l7, l8}means GIN icontains layers
5{l2i−1, l2i}, from the GIN. However, submodels splitted in this way are coupled from each other,
making them unable to defend against layer-perturbation attacks. To tackle this problem, we design
the novel GL model θthat is an ensemble of a set of Sindependent submodels {ϑ1, ϑ2,···, ϑS},
where each submodel ϑiis a base GL model. This approach can hence be easily adapted to any
existing FedGL. Further, to prevent homogeneity, we define varying channels for these submodels to
diversify them. Details of the model architecture are shown in Table 8 in Appendix C.
A majority-voting based ensemble classifier. The designed GL model architecture inspires us to
leverage the idea of ensemble classifier, which can combine the predictions of base “weak” classifiers.
Specifically, we propose a majority voting-based ensemble classifier to combine the predictions of
the submodels. Given a testing graph Gand a graph classifier f, we denote the prediction of the
submodel ϑiforGasy=f(ϑi, G)∈Y. For a GL model θwithSsubmodels {ϑ1, ϑ2,···, ϑS}, we
can count the submodels that classify Gto be yasNy=PS
i=1I(f(ϑi, G) =y). Then we introduce
our majority-voting based ensemble classifier gto classify Gas:g(θ, G) = arg maxy∈YNy. In
cases of ties, our ensemble classifier gselects the label with a smaller index.
3.4 Training the Proposed FedGL Model
The overall training process consists of three iterative steps: 1) training the proposed GL model in
all clients; 2) training the CWG module in watermarked clients , i.e., the clients that aim to inject
watermarked graphs for protecting the model ownership; and 3) aggregating the clients’ GL models
to produce the target watermarked model. The final global model is the learnt watermarked FedGL
model. Details of training can be seen in Algorithm 1 in the Appendix.
Step 1: Training the proposed GL model. Assume we have Twwatermarked clients with indexes
[1, Tw]. For each watermarked client i, we split its training graphs Giinto the watermarked graphs
Gi
wwith a target label, say yw, and remaining clean graphs Gi
c, and then customize the watermark
for each graph in Gi
wusing the CWG module (see Step 2 ). Given the client’s GL model θiwithS
submodels {ϑi
1, ϑi
2,···, ϑi
S}, we train each submodel ϑi
jvia minimizing the loss on Gi
candGi
w, i.e.,
ϑi
j= arg minϑi
jL(ϑi
j;Gi
cSGi
w). For an unwatermarked client k∈[Tw+ 1, T], we utilize all clean
graphs Gkto train each submodel ϑk
jseparately, i.e., ϑk
j= arg minϑk
jL(ϑk
j;Gk).
Step 2: Training the CWG. We denote the parameters of the CWG module for a watermarked client
i∈[1, Tw], asωi. The parameters include two networks, GatingNet andKeyNet . Each client i
trains its CWG ωito ensure that the generated watermarks be effective and diverse. Formally, we
haveωi= arg minωiL(θi;Gi
w),i∈[1, Tw].
Step 3: Aggregating clients’ GL models. The server averages GL models {θi}i∈Tto produce the
global model θ, and distributes this model to selected clients in the next iteration.
3.5 Model Ownership Verification
When suspecting the target FedGMark model θis illegally used by others, the model owner (all
the participating clients or their representative) can recruit a trusted judge for model ownership
verification. Typically, the judge requests both the true model owner and the illegal party to provide
some test data for verification. Only when the one knows the predictions by the target model for
the provided test data by both parties, the judge will confirm this party the model ownership. In
particular, besides providing the clean data Gi
cby both parties that behave normally, the true model
owner especially provides the designed watermarked data Gi
wthat only s/he knows the model behaves
on. As a result, both parties know the prediction results on Gi
c, but the illegal party is hard to predict
accurately on Gi
wprovided by the true model owner.
3.6 Certified Robustness Guarantees against Layer-Perturbation Attacks
We show the above design, with any layer-perturbation attack, ensures the predictions of the learnt wa-
termarked FedGL model and its compromised counterpart for the watermarked graphs are consistent,
once the number of perturbed layers is bounded. Given the target watermarked FedGL model θand
itsSsubmodels {ϑ1,···, ϑS}, we denote θ′as the comprised model and {ϑ′
1,···, ϑ′
S}as its Ssub-
models. For each watermarked graph Gw, we use the ensemble classifier gon submodels’ predictions,
i.e., its predictions on θandθ′areg(θ, Gw) = arg maxy∈YNy, and g(θ′, Gw) = arg maxy∈YN′
y,
respectively, where Ny=PS
i=1I(f(ϑi, G) =y)andN′
y=PS
i=1I(f(ϑ′
i, G) =y). Then we have
the following result on guaranteeing the number of perturbed layers on the target watermarked model.
6Theorem 1 (Certified number of perturbed layers r.)Letθ,θ′,g, andGwbe above defined. Sup-
poseNAandNBare the largest and second largest count outputted by gonGw, For any layer-
perturbation attack, we have g(θ, Gw) =g(θ′, Gw), when the number of perturbed layers rsatisfies:
r≤r∗= (NA−NB+ I[A < B ]−1)
2, (1)
where I[·]is the indicator function and ris called the certified number of perturbed layers.
We also show the tightness of our derived r∗in the following theorem:
Theorem 2 (Tightness of r∗.)Without using extra information of f, our derived r∗in Theorem 1 is
tight. I.e., r∗is the maximum number of perturbed layers tolerated by our target watermarked model.
The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are deferred to Appendix A.
4 Experiments
In this section, we comprehensively evaluate FedGMark on multiple datasets, FedGL models, attack
baselines, and experimental settings. More experimental results and discussions are in Appendix.
4.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets and models. We evaluate our FedGMark on four real-world graph datasets for graph
classification: MUTAG [Debnath et al. , 1991], PROTEINS [Borgwardt et al. , 2005], DD [Dobson
and Doig, 2003], and COLLAB [Yanardag and Vishwanathan, 2015]. Details about the statistics of
those datasets are shown in Table 6 in Appendix C. Following prior work Shen et al. [2022]; Xia et
al.[2024], we choose the well-known GIN [Xu et al. , 2019], GSAGE [Hamilton et al. , 2017], and
GCN [Kipf and Welling, 2017] as the GL model. All these network architectures involved in the
experiments are detailed in Table 8 in Appendix C.
Parameter setting. We implement our method using one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.
In FedGL, we use T= 40 clients in total and train the model 200 iterations. The server randomly
selects 50% clients in each iteration. We define the target label of watermarking graphs as 1, and
each participating client randomly selects 10% graphs with labels not 1as the watermarking graphs.
We extensively validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed watermarking method
with the following hyperparameters details: the number of submodels S={4,8,16}, the number
watermarked clients Tw={5,10,20}(both SandTware halved on MUTAG due to less data),
the watermarked nodes nw={3,4,5}, and the number of perturbed layers r={1,···,5}in the
layer-perturbation attack. By default, we set S= 4,Tw= 10 ,nw= 4,r= 1. While studying the
impact of a hyperparameter, we fix the others as the default value.
Evaluation metric. We use three metrics for evaluation: the main task accuracy (MA), watermark
accuracy (WA), and certified WA (CWA @r). An effective and robust watermarked model is expected
to achieve both high MA and WA. CWA evaluates the certified robustness of FedGMark against
layer-perturbation attacks. CWA @ris defined as the fraction of testing graphs that are provably
predicted as the target label, when at most rlayers in client models can be arbitrarily perturbed.
Attack baselines. We evaluate FedGMark against existing watermark removal attacks including
distillation and finetuning, and our proposed layer-perturbation attack. In our setting, the layer-
perturbation attack can replace anylayer(s)’ parameters of the target watermarked model with those
from the unwatermarked model to maximally reduce the watermark accuracy on its watermarked
graphs. When perturbing multiple layers, we utilize a greedy algorithm to decide the perturbed
layers—we search for one optimal perturbed layer at each step. Specifically, we first traverse
perturbing layers in the watermarked model and find the one that maximally reduces the watermark
accuracy. We then search for the remaining layers based on this one and continue the process.
4.2 Empirical Results: MA and WA
4.2.1 Results under the Default Setting
We first assess our FedGMark against empirical and layer-perturbation attacks under the default
setting. Experimental results are provided in Table 2. We have the following observations:
•1) Our FedGMark significantly outperforms the existing method under no attack. Recall
in Table 1 that [Xu et al. , 2023] obtains <60% WAs across all datasets and FedGL models. In
contrast, FedGMark can achieve WAs >70% in almost all cases, while having similar MAs.

Such significant improvements confirm the superiority of our learnt watermarks over the random
watermarks in [Xu et al. , 2023]. Figure 2 also visualizes example learnt watermarks and we can
see these watermarks are diversified due to the proposed CWG.
•2) Our FedGMark exhibits resistance to existing empirical attacks. As shown in Table 1,
existing methods are vulnerable to distillation and finetuning attacks. In contrast, the WAs of
FedGMark under these two attacks are almost the same as those under no attack, demonstrating
FedGMark is robust to the existing attacks.
•3) Our FedGMark is resilient to the proposed layer perturbation attack. We notice that the
existing method has difficulties in defending against the proposed layer-perturbation attacks and
shows an unsatisfactory WA, e.g., <25% WA in almost all cases under the 1-layer perturbation
attack. Conversely, our FedGMark can obtain a close WA compared to that without attack. This
verifies our ensemble classifier in FedGMark is capable of resisting the 1-layer perturbation attack.
4.2.2 Impact of Hyperparameters
This section studies the impact of hyperparameters in FedGMark against the layer-perturbation attack.
Impact of #submodels S.We first examine the impact of Son the performance of FedGMark
and report the results against the 1-layer perturbation attack in Table 3. We observe that the learnt
watermarked model can resist to the 1-layer perturbation attack under all Sand both the MAs and
WAs are also similar. This indicates the number of submodels marginally affects the watermarking
performance against the 1-layer perturbation attack.
8Table 4: Impact of #perturbed layers on FedGMark against our layer-perturbation attack. Compared
with Table 2, the change in MA is less than 4%in all cases.

Figure 3: CWA vs. #perturbed layers rin the layer-perturbation attack.
Impact of #watermarking clients Tw.The results on Tw= 5andTw= 20 are shown in Figure 4
in Appendix. We see that: the larger number of clients generating watermarks, the better our
watermarking performance. For instance, the WA improves by 11%,9%, and 7%, respectively on
the three FedGL models on PROTEINS when Twincreases from 5to20. This is because more
watermark clients (thus more watermarked graphs) can ensure the FedGL model better learns the
relation between the watermarks and the target label.
Impact of the watermark size nw.We also investigate nw= 3 andnw= 5, and the results are
presented in Figure 5 in Appendix. Similarly, FedGMark obtains higher WA with larger nw. This is
because a larger watermark size can facilitate the trained FedGL model better learn the watermark.
Impact of #perturbed layers. Finally, Table 4 shows the results of FedGMark vs. different
#perturbed layers. We observe that: 1) The WA decreases as increasing the #perturbed layers. This is
because the attacker has more attack capability by perturbing more layers. 2) Despite the theoretically
guaranteed CWA being 0at #perturbed layers ≥3as later depicted in the Figure 3, our empirical
watermarking performance can still achieves WA from 48% to58%. Note that the change in MA is
<4%in all cases, compared with Table 2.

(e) 0.82 0.47 0.71 0.56 0.73 0.39 0.73 0.57We investigate the contribution of each
module in FedGMark, including the
GatingNet andKeyNet in CWG, and
the submodels used in RML. The results
under the default setting and no attack
are shown in Table 5. First, GatingNet
plays a crucial role on generating more
effective watermarks and results in an improvement in WA from 8%to21%. Second, KeyNet
facilitates watermark differentiation between clients, leading to an improve on WA from 5% to 8%.
Third, the submodels in RML has a negligible impact on WA/MA. However, it is important to defend
against the layer-perturbation attack, as shown in Section 4.3.
94.3 Certified Robustness Results: Certified WA
In this section, we evaluate the certified robustness of FedGMark against the layer perturbation attack.
The CWAs on the three FedGL models and four datasets are depicted in Figure 3. We have several
observations: 1) FedGMark achieves promising provable robustness results against the worst-case
layer perturbation attack, when the #perturbed layers is within the certified range in Eqn (1). For
instance, when S= 4and0< r≤2, CWA is close to WA without attack ( r= 0). 2) As Sincreases,
the certified #perturbed layers also increases, showing that a more number of submodules in RML
can better provably defend against the layer-perturbation attack. For instance, when S= 16 , the
CWA is 86% on MUTAG even when 5 any layers in the global model are arbitrarily perturbed, while
it is 0 when S= 4. However, this is at the cost of requiring more computational resources (e.g., GPU
memory, runtime). As shown in Table 10 in Appendix, the runtime is linearly to S.
5 Related Work
Backdoor-based watermarking for centralized models on non-graph data. Many backdoor-based
watermarking methods [Lv et al. , 2023; Yan et al. , 2023; Tekgul et al. , 2021; Yang et al. , 2023; Li et
al., 2022a; Shao et al. , 2022; Lansari et al. , 2023] have been proposed that can empirically protect the
model ownership. These methods mainly focus on centralized learning models on non-graph (e.g.,
image) data. Compared with non-graph data, graph data have unique graph structure information,
e.g., entities are connected by links. Similarly, compared with centralized models, FL models are
collaboratively trained by multiple clients, which could have their own uniqueness. Bansal et al.
[2022] is the first watermarking method for centralized non-graph models with certified guarantee.
However, its certified robustness performance is unsatisfactory.
Backdoor-based watermarking for FL models on non-graph data. A few recent works Tekgul et
al.[2021]; Li et al. [2022a]; Bansal et al. [2022] design backdoor-based watermarks for protecting
the ownership of FL models on non-graph data, where the watermark can be injected into client’s
data or server’s validation data. For instance, Tekgul et al. [2021] presented WAFFLE, an approach
to watermark DNN models by incorporating a re-training step via watermarked data at the server.
Liet al. [2022a] leveraged each client’s private watermark to verify FL model ownership, ensuring
non-conflicting watermarks across different clients. However, these techniques cannot be directly
applied to graph data, as they often require fixed input data, while graph data often have varying sizes.
Moreover, all these methods do not provide guaranteed watermarking performance under the attack.
Backdoor-based watermarking for centralized GL models on graph data. The only work [Xu et
al., 2023] handling graph data uses random graph as the watermark. This method can be extended to
the FedGL model, but its watermarking performance is far from satisfactory–especially vulnerable to
watermark removal attacks such as distillation, finetuning, and the layer perturbation attack.
Backdoor attacks for centralized and federated GL models on graph data. Several works [Zhang
et al. , 2021; Yang et al. , 2024] design backdoor attacks to manipulate GL models, enabling the
attacker to influence the learned model to serve its purpose–the model will predict the attacker-chosen
label for test graphs once they contain a predefined trigger. For instance, Zhang et al. [2021] uses
random subgraphs as the trigger to backdoor centralized GL models, while Yang et al. [2024] learns
subgraph trigger to backdoor FedGL models. Note that the goal of these works is orthogonal to ours.
6 Conclusion
We protect the model ownership of emerging FedGL trained on distributed graph data, and use the de
facto backdoor-based watermarking method. We develop the first certifiably robust backdoor-based
watermarking method FedGMark for FedGL. FedGMark demonstrates the capability of achieving
high empirical watermarking performance under no attack, under existing backdoor removal attacks
and the proposed stronger layer-perturbation attack. FedGMark is also provably robust against the
worst-case layer-perturbation attack, once the number of perturbed layers is bounded by Theorem 1.

13A Proofs
Proof of Theorem 1: Given a watermarked graph Gw, a base graph classifier f, our ensemble
classifier g, and the target watermarked FedGL model θ={ϑi}S
i=1. Let θ′be the watermarked
FedGL model after the layer-perturbation attack. We denote by y=f(ϑi, Gw)the prediction of Gw
by submodel i, and g(θ, Gw) = arg maxy∈YNythe prediction of Gwby the target model θ, where
Ny=PS
i=1I(f(ϑi, Gw) =y)andθ={ϑi}S
i=1. Assume NAandNBare the largest and second
largest votes of the output of the ensemble classifier gon the target model θandGw, respectively.
Similarly, let N′
AandN′
Brespectively denote the corresponding votes of the model θ′. Under our GL
model architecture, each perturbed layer affects at most 1submodel in the worst case. Therefore, N′
A
andN′
Bsatisfy the following equations when rlayers in θare perturbed:
NA−r≤N′
A≤NA+r,
NB−r≤N′
B≤NB+r.(2)
Thus, g(θ′, G) =g(θ, G)when N′
A> N′
B, This means NA−r > N B+r− 1(A < B ), where
I(A < B )indicates we select a label with a smaller index in case of ties. Hence, rsatisfies:
r≤r∗=NA−NB+ I(A < B )−1

Proof of Theorem 2: We use proof by contradiction, i.e., when r > r∗, we can build a base classifier
f′such that there exists g(θ, Gw)̸=g(θ′, Gw). We select the smallest r=r∗+ 1for simplicity,
indicating that r∗+ 1layers whose model parameters can be arbitrarily perturbed. Assume there
exist a graph classifier f′under which, (r∗+ 1) submodels whose original predictions on Gware the
label Aand now become Bafterr∗+ 1layers are perturbed. Then we have N′
A=NA−(r∗+ 1)
andN′
B=NB+ (r∗+ 1) . Since r∗is the largest number such that Equation (2) is satisfied, i.e.,
NA−r∗> N B− 1(A < B ) +r∗holds. Thus,

D More Experimental Results
Impact of #watermarking clients Twand watermark size nw.See results in Figure 4 and Figure 5,
respectively. We can see FedGMark achieves better watermarking performance with a larger number
of clients generating watermarks; and a larger watermark size.
Impact of learning rate ( lr) and #local epochs ( le).The results with varying lrandleare shown in
Table 9 in Appendix. We can see that a large lrmay reduce WA, and WA increases slightly as le
grows, indicating more thorough training makes our method perform better.
Scalability of FedGMark. Compared with graph-based or non-robust watermarking methods, the
computation overhead of FedGMark is mainly from the introduced submodel models (fixing all the
other parameters, such as #clients, #iterations, to be the same). Particularly, the overhead scales
linearly with the number of submodels S, and the runtime results are shown in Table 10.
FedGMark under watermark/backdoor detection attacks. Many existing works [Zhang et al. ,
2021] show the trigger-reverse based backdoor detection is ineffective to “stealthy” backdoor. This
is because the effectiveness of trigger reverse attacks largely depends on the statistical differences
between clean data and backdoored data. Since we do not notice any graph backdoor trigger-reverse
attack, we instead propose to quantitatively test the structure similarity between the generated
watermarked graphs and the clean graphs. Here we use the metrics NetSim and DeltaCon proposed
in [Wills and Meyer, 2020], with the range [0,1]and the higher value the larger similarity. As shown
in Table 11, we observe the watermarked graphs and their clean counterparts are structurally very
close. This implies that the proposed watermarks are hard to be detected.

FedGMark on non-IID/heterogeneous datasets. Recall that the local watermarks in FedGMark
are learnt by considering the unique properties in each client. Such unique properties may include
the heterogeneity across clients’ data. To validate this, we also test FedGMark with non-IID graphs
across clients and show results in Table 12, where each client holds a single label data. We observe
that FedGMark demonstrates strong performance on non-IID datasets, indicating that the learnt
customized watermarks effectively capture the heterogeneity of clients’ graphs.
FedGMark against more knowledgeable/stronger adversaries. In our threat model, we assume all
clients and the server are benign and assume the attacker does not know our CWG. Here, we test
FedGMark against stronger adversaries, where some clients are malicious and the these malicious
clients also has access to the CWG component to manipulate the FedGL training. First, we consider a
passive attack where all malicious clients do not use CWG to generate customized local watermarks.
Model (b) in Table 5 shows the maximum WA decrease is 9%, where allclients do not use CWG.
Second, we test an active attack where malicious clients modify their watermark data’s label to
obfuscate the training. Specifically, all malicious clients’ watermark data are labeled (e.g., 2)
differently from the target label (e.g., 1) and then follow the federated training. The results in Table
13 show MA/WA is marginally affected even with 20% malicious clients.
FedGMark with alternative aggregation methods. The current FedGMark’s evaluation focuses on
FedAvg for aggregating client models. Here, we evaluate FedGMark using Multi-Krum [Blanchard
et al. , 2017] and Trim-mean [Yin et al. , 2018] aggregation methods that consider data quality (e.g.,
remove outlier clients). Specifically, Multi-Krum filters a set of pclients whose gradients largely
deviated from others, while Trim-mean trims off qhighest and lowest values for each parameter
in clients’ models. Table 14 shows the results with p= 10 andq= 10 . We can see these robust
aggregators achieve a robustness-utility tradeoff, and MA and WA are not largely different.

Figure 6: Global watermark vs. local watermarks 1-4.
FedGMark with alternative triggers such as feature-based triggers and hybrid triggers. The
current FedGMark relies on graph structural information to learn the trigger used in watermark. Here,
we adjust FedGMark to learn feature-based triggers and hybrid feature-structure triggers.
To learn feature-based triggers, we first select a set of nodes from a graph as the target nodes, and
learn the watermarked features for the target nodes (we do not watermark structure). We use a graph
Gi= (Vi,Ei,Xi)from client ifor illustration, where Xiis the node feature matrix. We then define a
feature-mask Mi
f[vj] = 1 ifvj∈Vi
wand 0 otherwise, where Vi
wis the watermark node set described
in the paper. Then, we introduce a feature network ( FeaNet ) that learns watermarked node features
asXi
w= FeaNet( Xi)⊙Mi
f. The FeaNet takes input Xiand outputs a matrix having the same size
asXi, e.g., it has the same architecture as GatingNet but adjusts the input size. The corresponding
watermarked graph is defined as Gi
w= (Vi,Ei,Xi
w). By generating a set of watermarked graphs
Gi
wfor client i, we minimize the loss on client i’s both clean graphs Gi
candGi
w.
Further, to learn feature-structure triggers, we combine FeaNet (that gets Xi
w) with
GatingNet /KeyNet (that gets Ei
w), and the watermarked graphs are Gi
w= (Vi,Ei
w,Xi
w). We
then minimize the loss on Gi
candGi
w. More details about training refer to Section 3.4.
We evaluate these triggers and the results are in Table 15. We observe that structure information alone
is sufficient to enable designing effective triggers.
E Discussion
Global watermark vs. local watermarks. In this paper, each client employs CWG to generate
watermarks (i.e., local watermarks) to train the local model. During testing, we can use either local
watermarks or a global watermark, i.e., fully connect local watermarks. Here, we further evaluate
the impact of global watermark vs. local watermarks of the target watermarked model under default
settings. For better clarity, we randomly select four local watermarks labeled as local watermarks 1
to4. The experimental results depicted in Figure 6 demonstrate that, despite not being part of the
training process, the global watermark performs slightly better than local watermarks. This implies
that the distributed training of FedGL can aggregate the effects of local watermarks, providing a
foundation for utilizing the global watermark for verification.

Ensemble classifier with majority voting vs. summation on submodels’ outputs. In this paper, we
propose an ensemble classifier gto aggregate the predictions of each submodel ϑithrough a voting
mechanism and classify a graph Gasg(θ, G) = arg maxy∈YNy, where Ny=PS
i=1 I(f(ϑi, G) =
y). Another common strategy, as used in GL models such as GIN [Xu et al. , 2019], is to sum
the prediction confidence vector of each submodel ϑi, i.e., g(θ, G) = arg maxy∈YfG, where fG=PS
i=1f(ϑi, G)andfoutputs a probabilistic confidence vector whose summation is 1. Here, we also
test our FedGMark with this strategy against the 1-layer perturbation attack, and the results are shown
in Table 16. We notice the results do not remain consistent across different numbers of submodels and
are worse than those in Table 3, especially when Sis small. This suggests that the summing-based
ensemble classifier is not robust to the layer-perturbation attack, emphasizing the necessity of our
proposed majority-voting based ensemble classifier.
FedGMark against offline clients that cannot provide watermark data or malicious clients that
provide fake watermark samples during ownership verification. We deem that our ownership
verification is still robust against offline clients and malicious clients, if its number is less than 50%.
During ownership verification, each client provides its own watermark data to the trusted judge.
When some clients are offline, the trusted judge can simply neglect them and only use participating
clients’ watermark data for verification.
When facing malicious clients, their negative effect can be circumvented through a majority voting-
based approach. Specifically, all clients provide their own watermark data to the judge and obtain the
watermark accuracy per client. Though the watermark accuracy on malicious clients could be very
low, the majority of benign clients can produce more number of high watermark accuracy, compared
to the number of low accuracy. When the judge uses the majority-vote strategy, the final watermark
accuracy is still high, ensuring the accurate ownership claim for benign clients.
Using clients’ training graphs as the watermark samples and sending them to the trust judge
may lead to privacy leakage. We clarify that the watermark data are not necessarily generated from
the training/test samples. Remember the primary goal of backdoor-based watermarking is to force
the model to memorize the relationship between the backdoor trigger (in the watermark samples)
and the target label, while the samples to inject the trigger do not have constraints, i.e., they can be
from training samples or artificially synthesized (which does not contain privacy information of any
training/test data). For conveniences, existing methods inject backdoor triggers into the training/test
samples. To validate this, we synthesize a set of random graphs using the popular Erd ˝os–Rényi
model (via the NetworkX toolbox) and the watermark samples are generated by injecting the learnt
watermark on the synthesized graphs. Under the default setting, we test on Fed-GIN and show results
in Table 17, where we observe WAs are very close to those shown in the paper on the four datasets.
Furthermore, since all clients intend to verify model ownership, it is reasonable to believe that these
clients are willing to provide their watermark data—whether generated from private training/test
data or non-private synthesized data—exclusively to a trusted judge, with informed consent and in
accordance with legal and ethical standards. From this perspective, the data is confidential between
each client and the trusted judge. We acknowledge it is very interesting future work to design a
provably private mechanism for model ownership verification that the verifier cannot access the
watermark data but can guarantee the correctness of verification.
19NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We clearly state the research problem, motivation, and contributions of this
paper in the Abstract and Introduction.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the approach in the Discussion section, e.g., using
clients’ training graphs as watermark samples and sending them to the trusted judge could
lead to privacy leakage.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

in the supplementary.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our experimental results are reproducible. We provide detailed experimental
settings in the main text.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
21Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include links to the source code in the abstract.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide training and test details in the experimental part.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our experimental results are stable.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
22• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All experiments can be reproduced using one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
GPU.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This research conforms to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Positive societal impacts: Our proposed watermark i.e. FedGMark can protect
the ownership of FedGL models.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
23•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper poses no the above risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the reference of datasets employed in this paper following their
requirements.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
24•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no dataset contribution in this paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing and research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
