Abstract
Recent advancements in vision-language-to-image (VL2I) diffusion generation
have made significant progress. While generating images from broad vision-
language inputs holds promise, it also raises concerns about potential misuse,
such as copying artistic styles without permission, which could have legal and
social consequences. Therefore, it’s crucial to establish governance frameworks to
ensure ethical and copyright integrity, especially with widely used diffusion models.
To address these issues, researchers have explored various approaches, such as
dataset filtering, adversarial perturbations, machine unlearning, and inference-time
refusals. However, these methods often lack either scalability or effectiveness.
In response, we propose a new framework called causal representation editing
(CRE), which extends representation editing from large language models (LLMs) to
diffusion-based models. CRE enhances the efficiency and flexibility of safe content
generation by intervening at diffusion timesteps causally linked to unsafe concepts.
This allows for precise removal of harmful content while preserving acceptable
content quality, demonstrating superior effectiveness, precision and scalability
compared to existing methods. CRE can handle complex scenarios, including
incomplete or blurred representations of unsafe concepts, offering a promising
solution to challenges in managing harmful content generation in diffusion-based
models.
1 Introduction
Expanding on recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion generation, which is great at making
realistic and varied images from written descriptions, researchers are now delving into more advanced
vision-language-to-image (VL2I) generation techniques. In these VL2I methods, especially with
diffusion models, some use both images of a subject and written descriptions to render the subject
in a new context, which is called subject-driven generation [ 1,2]. Others take original images and
instructions for changes to create altered images, known as image editing [ 3]. Early approaches
either fine-tune models on new images [ 4,2,5,6,7] or directly inject image features into the U-Net
of diffusion models [ 8,9,1,10]. However, these methods struggle to jointly model multi-modal
inputs and fully leverage the generalization ability of the diffusion model. BLIP-Diffusion [ 11] is
a notable advancement because it creates object representations by blending images with random
backgrounds, allowing for the generation of single objects without prior examples. Building on this,
Kosmos-G [ 12] expands to generate multiple objects without examples, using multi-modal large

inputs into a single feature set.
The advent of a large multi-modal encoder has endowed diffusion models with zero-shot generation,
enabling the transfer of concepts (e.g., object or style) to new scenes. However, this unrestricted
capability also brings up ethical concerns. There’s a risk that people with bad intentions could
use zero-shot generation to transfer harmful concepts, like violence or pornography, with just one
reference image. Existing efforts in safe generation [ 13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]
primarily focus on mitigating internal risks stemming from model defects. Diffusion models trained
on unedited, large-scale, web-scraped datasets often learn inappropriate and unauthorized knowledge,
posing risks when users manipulate textual prompts to “extract” unsafe content.
Researchers have pursued various strategies to mitigate the generation of harmful content, encom-
passing four primary approaches: dataset filtering [ 13,14], adversarial perturbations [ 15,16,17,18],
machine unlearning [ 19,20], and inference-time refusals [ 21,22,23]. Filtering the dataset involves
removing images containing explicit or objectionable content, such as nudity and violence, to ensure
the safe generation of diffusion models. However, the advent of zero-shot learning introduces chal-
lenges, as it enables diffusion models to transfer unseen objects and styles, complicating copyright
protection and security review processes. While adversarial perturbations offer a means to safeguard
specific images from manipulation, their efficacy is hampered by the need for training and adaptation
to diffusion models with varying parameters. This lack of scalability arises from the requirement to
train different adversarial perturbations for each model, despite their structural similarities. Similarly,
unlearning-based methods address inherent model defects but fall short in addressing the use of
external unsafe images for concept transfer by users. Moreover, existing inference-time refusals
predominantly target unsafe concepts describable by language, thus exhibiting limited effectiveness
in multi-modal zero-shot generation scenarios. These limitations underscore the need for novel
approaches to address the evolving challenges associated with safe content generation in diffusion
models.
Contributions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Causal Represen-
tation Editing (CRE), which generalizes representation editing for transformer-based Large Language
Models (LLMs) to diffusion-based generative models. CRE enhances the efficiency and flexibility of
safe concept transfer by introducing a plug-and-play inference-time intervention in diffusion timesteps
causally related to unsafe concepts. Our framework comprises two key components: 1) Editing
function: We construct steering vectors from examples of unsafe concepts to precisely eliminate
them from the original representations. 2) Editing timesteps: We propose “assess-with-exclusion”
to identify the causal period for each unsafe concept, during which the unsafe concept appears
in the noisy image. This approach reduces editing overhead and avoids ineffective interventions
in irrelevant diffusion timesteps, maintaining high editing fidelity. Our contributions include: 1)
An early exploration of safe concept transfer in MLLM-enabled diffusion models, with our CRE
framework enabling effective inference-time unsafe concept removal. 2) Precise removal of unsafe
concepts from noisy images while retaining reasonably generated content, reducing editing overhead
by nearly half through fine-grained editing based on the causal period. 3) Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrating that CRE surpasses existing methods in effectiveness, preciseness, and scalability,
even in complex scenarios involving incomplete or blurred features of unsafe concepts.
2 Related Work
Vision-Language-to-Image Diffusion Models. The fundamental aspect of achieving Vision-
Language-to-Image (VL2I) generation lies in training multi-modal encoders responsible for aligning
and fusing features from diverse input modalities. BLIP-Diffusion [ 11] adopts an “align-after-
encoding” approach to train its multi-modal encoder. Initially, images and text undergo separate
encoding by individual single-modal encoders. Subsequently, following BLIP-2 [ 24], the Q-Former
architecture aligns visual features with text features. However, this pre-training strategy restricts
BLIP-Diffusion to accept only a single image as the input for the visual modality during zero-shot
generation. Conversely, Kosmos-G [ 12] employs an “align-before-encoding” paradigm to train its
multi-modal encoder. Kosmos-G pursues the objective of treating images as a foreign language in the
image generation process. It incorporates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to jointly
encode images and text, with each image being embedded into 64 tokens. By utilizing the pre-trained

containing unsafe concepts as reference images (objects or styles), here taking the “Van Gogh” style
as an example. CRE consists of two main phases. Phase 1 involves discriminator training and causal
period search for each unsafe concept category, which can be performed offline (omitted from this
figure, see section 3.3 for details). During inference (phase 2, i.e., the right side of this figure), if
the reference image contains unsafe concepts, the editing function of CRE is applied within the
U-Net layers. Otherwise, the generated content is faithful to the user-specified prompts without
modification.
MLLM as an alternative to CLIP encoders [ 25], diffusion models gain the capability of zero-shot
generation based on multiple input images.
Inference-time Safe Concept Transfer. Inference-time safe concept transfer enables generation
service providers to dynamically deploy and adjust governance rules, particularly in response to
potentially unsafe input from users. Existing approaches typically involve either post-generation
detection or in-process adjustment to ensure safety. Rando et al. [21] employ a method where the
generated image is projected into a CLIP latent space [ 25] for comparison against pre-computed
embeddings of unsafe concepts, with images surpassing a similarity threshold being flagged as unsafe.
However, this approach lacks precision in removing unsafe concepts while preserving overall image
quality. Conversely, SLD [ 22] and ProtoRe [ 23] integrate safe guidance directly into the diffusion
process. These techniques rely on textual descriptions of unsafe concepts, encoded using a CLIP
text encoder, to provide negative guidance for denoising. SLD [ 22] adjusts the diffusion process by
modifying the predicted noise from the U-Net, while ProtoRe [ 23] extracts unsafe concepts from
the attention map and refines them. These strategies face limitations when unsafe concepts are not
effectively described through natural language.
Representation Editing for LLMs. Current studies on Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) [ 26] in
Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that many LLMs exhibit interpretable directions in their
activation spaces, which influence their inference processes. For instance, by introducing carefully
designed steering vectors to specific layers for particular tokens, the output can be significantly biased,
regardless of the user prompt’s topic [ 27]. Developing a training-free editing method to mitigate
unsafe concepts in generative models offers two key advantages. Firstly, it allows the model to retain
its strong zero-shot generation ability by preserving the knowledge from pre-training. Secondly, as
unsafe concepts may change dynamically due to legal or copyright factors, a plug-and-play editing
method can efficiently add or remove types of unsafe concepts under governance.
3 Safe Concept Transfer
3.1 Threat Model
LetIrepresent the images generated by a diffusion model Gθbased on a multi-modal prompt,
which includes a text prompt pand a reference image r. The reference image can contain up to K
pre-defined unsafe concepts ˜ck, k= 1,2,···, K, such as legally protected concepts. Our goal is
to intervene in the image generation process to remove these concepts from I. For example (see
3Figure 1), an adversary might aim to profit by plagiarizing the style of an artistic work, such as a Van
Gogh painting. They could use such a painting as a reference image to counterfeit infringing images
using VL2I models with zero-shot generation capabilities. Additionally, unwitting users might input
images containing unsafe concepts as reference images (objects or styles). These scenarios can lead
to significant social problems and economic losses for generation service providers and copyright
owners.
In contrast to prior studies that primarily address internal generation issues stemming from the
diffusion process itself (often due to unedited training data [ 14]), our focus is on a new challenge
where risks originate from external factors that impact the model. The key distinction between these
two scenarios lies in whether users can prompt the generation of unsafe content solely through text
inputs. In the case of internal unsafe generation, users might inadvertently generate nudity images by
using the term “Four Horsemen” as a text prompt. In contrast, external unsafe generation involves
users providing a nude image as a reference to generate more pornographic images. In this latter
scenario, the model relies on externally provided visual information to generate new images.
Capability: Regulators can define a set of unsafe concepts based on existing laws, regulations, or
proposals from copyright owners. Each category of unsafe concepts is accompanied by at least one
example image. The VL2I generation service is offered to users through an API. Regulators have the
ability to fully control the inference process of the generation model, without any prior information
about the user input prompts.
Objective: Methods aimed at removing unsafe concepts must be effective and precise. Effectiveness
ensures the legality of the generated image, while precision ensures that the reasonable content in
the generated image is preserved. It is essential that the service experience of normal users remains
unaffected, meaning the system must respond appropriately to requests involving safe concepts.
3.2 Preliminaries
Diffusion. Diffusion-based models, denoted as Gθ, progressively refine an initial Gaussian noisy
image xT∼ N(0,I)to generate images x0that faithfully represent the user’s input prompt p, r. At
each timestep t∈[T, T−1,···,1], the model estimates the noise ˜ϵθto be subtracted from the current
noisy image xt. This denoising process can be succinctly expressed as xt−1=xt−˜ϵθ(xt, t, p, r )2.
The noise estimate ˜ϵθ(xt, t, p, r )is computed as a linear combination of the unconditional generation
ϵθ(xt, t)and the conditional generation ϵθ(xt, t, p, r ):
˜ϵθ(xt, t, p, r ) =ϵθ(xt, t) +sg(ϵθ(xt, t, p, r )−ϵθ(xt, t)), (1)
where the guidance scale sgmodulates the impact of the conditioning information, allowing for
flexible adjustment of the conditioning strength.
Inference-Time Safe Guidance. SLD [ 22] introduced the first inference-time safety guidance for
latent diffusion models to address issues related to inappropriate image generation. This approach
extends the generative process by integrating text conditioning using classifier-free guidance and
suppressing inappropriate concepts from the output image. Specifically, it introduces a negative
concept condition p′via the text prompt, following noise estimation principles. Essentially, this
method adjusts the unconditional noise prediction towards the user prompt conditioned estimate
while simultaneously moving it away from the negative concept conditioned estimate:
˜ϵSLD
θ(xt, t, p, r ) =ϵθ(xt, t) +sg(ϵθ(xt, t, p, r )−ϵθ(xt, t)−µ(ϵθ(xt, t, p′)−ϵθ(xt, t))),(2)
where µis concept-dependent guidance scale.
SLD exhibits two key limitations. Firstly, its effectiveness relies heavily on text prompts that can
precisely describe negative concepts. In contexts where images are included in the prompt for
zero-shot generation, SLD’s performance is significantly constrained by the lack of precise textual
descriptions of the reference image. Secondly, while SLD introduces security guidance, it impacts
the experience of benign users. The magnitude of this impact is contingent upon the setting of the
guidance scale, necessitating a balance between safety and utility.
Previous research on representation engineering [ 30,31] has demonstrated that representations
in transformer architecture encode intricate semantic details, suggesting that manipulating these

4representations could be a more effective approach than updating noisy images. In this paper,
we explore this idea further by introducing representation editing for large multi-modal diffusion
models. Instead of directly guiding safe generation, our method manipulates a small portion of latent
representations to steer the denoising process, thereby removing unsafe concepts during inference.
3.3 Causal Representation Editing
Representation Editing Framework. Current research on representation editing [ 30,31] mainly
focuses on three key components ⟨F, L, P ⟩, where Fdenotes the editing function, Lrepresents the
number of editing layers, and Pindicates the editing token position (e.g., the number of prefix or
suffix positions to intervene). Recognizing the unique characteristics of diffusion models compared
to language generation models, we introduce the timestep dimension Tand extend representation
editing from discriminative or autoregressive predictive models to diffusion-based generative models.
Definition 1. A representation editing framework for diffusion-based generative models can be
defined by a tuple ⟨Φ,L,P,T ⟩, which governs an inference-time intervention on the representa-
tions computed by the U-Net throughout the diffusion process. This framework comprises four key
components:
•The editing function Φ :Rd→Rd, which encompasses operations such as linear combina-
tions, piece-wise operations, and projections.
•A set of layers L ⊆1,···, min the U-Net where the editing is applied.
•A set of input positions P ⊆1,···, nto which the editing is applied. For text prompts, token
locations are typically specified, while mask guidance is commonly used for image prompts.
•A set of timesteps T ⊆1,···, Tduring which the editing is applied.
This framework enables precise control over the editing operation, allowing for targeted interventions
to modify the generated outputs as needed. In the following, we introduce our causal representation
editing by detailing the four components mentioned above. The U-Net architecture comprises layers
broadly classified into convolution layers, self-attention layers, and cross-attention layers. Prior
investigations into image editing [ 32,33,34] have elucidated that cross-attention layers facilitate the
amalgamation of noisy images and user prompts, yielding fused features. Specifically, The noisy
image ztis projected to a query matrix via a linear layer ℓQ(·), denoted as Q=ℓQ(zt). The embedded
user prompt {p, r}is projected to a key matrix K=ℓK(p, r)and a value matrix V=ℓV(p, r)
through linear layers ℓK(·)andℓV(·). The attention representations Aare then calculated as follows:
A= SoftmaxQKT
√
d
·V∈Rd. (3)
Visualizing the attention map Softmax( QKT/√
d)(see Appendix-F), we can observe that concepts
from the prompts manifest in the weighted output representations. Consequently, the editing is
implemented immediately following the computation of Aand influences the representations within
each cross-attention layer.
Editing Function. The editing function typically receives the original representation (to be edited)
and the representation of a specific concept (referred to as a steering vector) as input, aiming to
amplify or suppress the concept in the original representation. For instance, ActAdd [ 27] employs
linear addition in the transformer activation layer of a LLM to incorporate the representation of a
particular topic (e.g., “wedding”) into the original representation. This ensures that regardless of the
user prompt, the model’s output will be biased towards the wedding topic.
In this paper, we construct steering vectors based on examples of unsafe concepts. For the k-th type
of unsafe concept, we employ a procedure akin to Equation 3 to create a steering vector containing
the unsafe concept. To precisely remove the unsafe concept from the original representations,
we project out the component of the representation aligned with the steering vector: Φ(A,˜Ak) =
A−P
kAT˜Ak
∥˜Ak∥2·˜Ak,where ˜Ak= Softmax( Q˜KT/√
d)·˜V= Softmax( ℓQ(zt)ℓK(˜ck)T/√
d)·ℓV(˜ck).
Ablation study in Appendix-E demonstrates the effectiveness of the projection-based representation
editing.
5Although representation editing effectively removes unsafe concepts from generated images, it can
hinder generation with benign prompts. As the number of unsafe concepts requiring governance
grows, representation editing can significantly degrade image quality. To ensure scalability, we utilize
the VL2I generation for data augmentation. Then, we train a discriminator fk:RC×(H×W)→[0,1]
to evaluate the confidence that an image contains an unsafe concept ck. This discriminator acts as an
indicator for determining whether representation editing should be applied, yielding the final editing
function:
Φ(A,˜Ak) =A−X
k⌊fk(r)⌉(AT˜Ak
∥˜Ak∥2·˜Ak). (4)
Editing Timesteps. Previous research [ 35] has demonstrated that the diffusion process generates
different elements at various stages. Initially, the diffusion process primarily generates low-frequency
features such as layout and object contours, while in later stages, it produces high-frequency features
such as color and texture. As unsafe concepts typically represent either concrete objects or abstract
styles, their generation is often constrained to specific timesteps and does not encompass the entire
diffusion process. Consequently, applying representation editing at each diffusion step would
introduce unnecessary computational overhead. For more precise editing, we seek to identify specific
diffusion periods during which the unsafe concept ckmanifests in the noisy image.
Drawing inspiration from causal tracing in knowledge editing [ 33], we introduce the causal period
for the generation of a given concept in the diffusion process.
Definition 2. For a concept ck, a causal period [ts, te]is defined as a period during which there
is no shorter diffusion period that yields better generation quality for ck. For any diffusion period
[ts, te]that satisfies [ts, te]̸= [t∗
s, t∗
e]∧(te−ts)≤(t∗
e−t∗
s), we have:
fk(G⟨Φ,L,P,T=[ts,te]⟩(ck))≥fk(G⟨Φ,L,P,T=[t∗s,t∗e]⟩(ck)) +δk, (5)
where δkis a small constant.
In Equation 5, we use the classification confidence of the discriminator fkforckto assess its
generation safety.
Causal Period Search. Previous causal tracing methods employ a “corrupted-with-restoration”
approach to identify the most crucial hidden state variable in LLMs when recalling a fact. Given
Tdiffusion rounds, the search space for determining the causal period through sampling is 2T−1
(excluding the empty set), which is considerably larger than the linear search space in the causal
tracing problem seeking a single optimal solution. To tackle this complexity, we propose a heuristic
approach named “assess-with-exclusion”. We start by considering representation editing at each step
of the entire diffusion process, gradually corrupting the process from t=Ttot= 1. At each step,
we evaluate whether the current corruption significantly impacts the generation of the unsafe concept
ck. The confidence gap of the discriminator fkbefore and after corruption serves as an indicator. If
this gap is smaller than the predefined threshold δk, it suggests that not performing representation
editing in the current diffusion step minimally affects the removal of the unsafe concept ck. In such
cases, we continue assessing whether the next step is crucial. If the gap exceeds δk, we identify the
current step as the starting step tsof the causal period. Once tsis determined, we conduct a similar
backward search process from the last step t= 1to identify the ending step teof the causal period.
The pseudocode of algorithm for searching tsandteis present in Appendix-A.
Given the Markovian nature of the diffusion process, we first search for tsand exclude [T, ts+ 1],
followed by the search for teand exclusion of [ts−1,1]. Excluding [ts−1,1]at the second step
does not affect the diffusion process before timestep te. During the search for tsandte, the search
can be terminated when the current timestep is identified as an important step for the first time. This
is because once tsis determined, the subsequent adjacent steps are likely to be influenced by it and
are also likely to be important steps; similarly, once teis determined, the preceding diffusion step is
likely to be an important step. The computational complexity of Algorithm 1 scales linearly with the
total number of diffusion steps T.
Inference with CRE. Our proposed causal representation editing, outlined in Appendix-B, comprises
two main phases. Phase 1 involves discriminator training and causal period search for each category
of unsafe concept, which can be conducted offline. During inference (Phase 2), if the reference image
contains unsafe concepts, causal representation editing is applied within the cross-attention layers.
Otherwise, the generated content remains faithful to the user-specified prompt without modification.
64 Experiments
In this section, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed Causal Representation
Editing (CRE). We use Kosmos-G [ 12] as the base model for concept transfer, comprising an MLLM
as a prompt encoder and stable diffusion as an image decoder. Our approach is benchmarked against
several baseline methods: Kosmos-G [ 12], Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD) [ 22], and ProtoRe [ 23].
Additionally, we include an intuitive method, Kosmos-G-Neg, which manually adds negative prompts
(e.g., “without Van Gogh style”) behind the user prompt. To ensure experimental fairness, none of
the comparison methods involve any fine-tuning of the generative model. For determining the causal
period, we set δkto 0 for all types of unsafe concepts. We conduct all experiments on an RTX 3090
and an A100-80G.
Safe Object Transfer. We first evaluate our approach’s performance in safe object transfer through
quantitative analysis. We select one class from the ImageNet dataset as an unsafe concept and
generate 500 images using the prompt “an image of a [ class name ]” with Stable Diffusion 2.1 [ 36].
The guidance scale is set to 9.0. Following previous work [ 20,23], we use a subset of ImageNet
with ten easily recognizable classes as the targeted unsafe concepts. Using Kosmos-G, we create
prompts in the form “[ image 1 ] with [ image 2 ]” to combine 500 images of each class with other
images for object transfer. Here, [ image 1 ] is a portrait, as people are commonly depicted with the
ten targeted objects, and [ image 2 ] is selected from the 500 images of each targeted class. We set the
guidance scale to 7.5. Finally, we evaluate the top-1 classification accuracy of the transfer results
using a pre-trained ResNet-50 ImageNet classifier.
In Table 1, we present quantitative results comparing the accuracy of safe object transfer using
Kosmos-G and four safe generation methods. Each class’s objects are considered unsafe concepts,
and accuracy indicates the ratio of these objects included in the generated image. A lower accuracy
signifies better safety in object transfer. The “Kosmos-G” row reports the accuracy of object transfer
without any safe generation mechanism, serving as a baseline. Kosmos-G exhibits varying abilities to
transfer different objects. Our experiments focus on evaluating whether the safe generation method
effectively reduces the generation rate of corresponding unsafe concepts. Existing methods show
certain limitations: Kosmos-G-Neg not only fails to achieve safe generation but also increases
the probability of generating the corresponding object. We provide a comparison between images
generated by Kosmos-G and Kosmos-G-Neg in Appendix-D. This anomaly suggests that the MLLM
encoder struggles to interpret the explicit “without” command in the prompt. SLD adjusts the noise
prediction of U-Net in diffusion models using auxiliary guidance, making it suitable for localized
image detail retouching. However, its effectiveness in object removal appears limited. ProtoRe
performs well in most categories but struggles when dealing with large objects (e.g., church) that
occupy a significant portion of the image. In contrast, our proposed CRE method demonstrates
superior unsafe concept removal capabilities across all categories. In addition, we undertake a test
with the COCO-30k dataset with two images (the first one is about cassette and the other one is about
Mickey Mouse, which could be found in Figure 2).

Safe Style Transfer. Table 2 presents quantitative results comparing the accuracy of safe style transfer
using Kosmos-G and four safe generation methods. We selected four styles as unsafe concepts: Disney,
Pencil Sketch, Picasso, and Van Gogh. We create our dataset and train a ResNet-50 classifier and
a ViT-base classifier based on the dreambench dataset [ 2] for unsafe style transfer. This dataset
comprises 158 images, all featuring simple objects and backgrounds, which facilitates successful
style transfer. In terms of classification, 96.20% of the 158 original images in the dreambench dataset
are classified as safe images by ResNet-50, and 94.94% are considered safe images by the ViT-base
classifier. Further details on dataset construction, classifier training, and image style transfer processes
are provided in Appendix-C. Compared to Table 1, the performance of both SLD and ProtoRe has
declined to varying degrees, indicating that relying solely on text prompts to accurately describe
unsafe concepts is inefficient in multi-modal zero-shot generation scenarios. Safe concept transfer
based on representation editing, on the other hand, proves effective in removing both concrete objects
and abstract styles.
Examples of unsafe concepts removal is shown in Figure 3. Kosmos-G can combine human portraits
with other objects, and can also transfer artistic styles to images of dogs, ducks, glasses, etc. Existing
methods are either ineffective when removing these unsafe concepts, or the removal is incomplete
and leaves residues. Our approach is able to remove unsafe concepts without leaving any trace.
Multiple Style Transfer. To assess the scalability of our approach, we consider scenarios where
multiple unsafe concepts may require governance simultaneously. We use Kosmos-G with the same
prompts in the form of “[ image 1 ] in the style of [ image 2 ]” to transfer the images in Dreambench
to the selected styles, in which [ image 1 ] is an image in Dreambench and [ image 2 ] represents one
of the reference images for 4 unsafe styles. However, we replace the prompts with multiple style
concepts for SLD (“without the style of Disney, Pencil sketch, Picasso and Van Gogh”) and ProtoRe
(“the style of Disney, Pencil sketch, Picasso and Van Gogh”). For CRE, we first use the classifier to
judge whether the images in the prompts belong to unsafe concepts and which unsafe concept they
belong to. If the image belongs to an unsafe style, we activate CRE for the unsafe prompt; If not,
the prompt undergoes the normal Kosmos-G process. Finally, we evaluate the top-1 classification
accuracy of the transfer results using the classifiers trained above.

Figure 4: Qualitative safe generation results on multiple concepts.
Table 3 compares the performance difference between targeting a single unsafe concept and targeting
multiple unsafe concepts simultaneously. As the number of unsafe concepts increases, the perfor-
mance of SLD and ProtoRe decreases. This decline is attributed to the length of negative text prompts,
which increases with the number of unsafe concepts. Different prompt lengths are encoded into fixed
lengths by the encoder, and overly long prompts may lead to information distortion during encoding.
While SLD and ProtoRe perform better when dealing with a single unsafe concept, they may not
be suitable for tasks requiring simultaneous governance of multiple unsafe concepts in practical
scenarios. In contrast, our method exhibits consistent performance, with almost no difference in per-
formance between processing a single unsafe concept and multiple unsafe concepts (the performance
gap is less than 0.1%). In particular, when multiple unsafe concepts require supervision, both SLD
and ProtoRe tend to retain some additional concepts in the generated image. As illustrated in Figure
4, the little yellow duck generated by SLD and ProtoRe, after the removal of the Disney style, still
retains concepts such as brown hair. A similar issue is observed in the can image after the removal of
the Van Gogh style. In contrast, our method effectively generates images free from residual obtrusive
concepts following the removal of unsafe styles.
Complex scenarios and precise mitigation. Figure 5 (left) illustrates the effectiveness of our method
in removing unsafe concepts in complex scenarios. We examine several challenging situations, such
as users employing blurred images, portraits in unsafe styles, images taken with mobile phones,
cropped images, and overexposed or oversaturated images as reference images for concept transfer.
Our method successfully detects and removes unsafe concepts present in these perturbed images.
Figure 5 (right) highlights the precision of our method in removing specific unsafe concepts. For
instance, when dealing with concepts like Van Gogh and Pencil sketch, our approach preserves
reasonable generated content, such as hats and buildings. Unlike rigid blacklists and denial-of-service
methods, our approach offers greater flexibility in implementing safe concept transfer.
Safe Generation. Table 4 shows the effectiveness of our method in safe generation with the I2P
dataset. Compared with previous Representative qualitative results can be found in Appendix-G.

5 Limitation
We identify two primary shortcomings of CRE from two aspects: effectiveness and overhead. Firstly,
the effectiveness of CRE is contingent upon the accuracy of the unsafe concept discriminator,
represented by the term ⌊fk(r)⌉in Equation 4. If the discriminator’s accuracy is low, CRE might
perform representation editing even for safe prompts. As evidenced in Table 3 and Figure 4, as
the number of unsafe concepts requiring simultaneous governance increases, the adverse impact
of inadequate discriminator performance becomes more pronounced. Secondly, in comparison to
safe generation methods that utilize fine-tuned diffusion models, representation editing introduces
additional inference overhead. Nevertheless, since CRE is only applied in the cross-attention layer
during a specific causal period, this additional overhead remains within a tolerable range. For
instance, Kosmos-G requires 226 seconds to generate 100 images, and after incorporating CRE, the
time increases to 246 seconds, resulting in an average increase of 0.2 seconds per image.
6 Conclusion
This paper proposes a novel approach, Causal Representation Editing (CRE), to address the challenges
of unsafe concept transfer in large multi-modal diffusion models. By leveraging causal periods, CRE
allows for precise and efficient removal of unsafe elements from generated images while preserving
the integrity and quality of the generated content. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation highlights
CRE’s superiority over existing methods in both safe object and style transfer tasks. Specifically,
CRE effectively reduces the presence of unsafe concepts, demonstrating its robustness across a
variety of scenarios. Moreover, CRE exhibits strong scalability, maintaining consistent performance
when managing multiple unsafe concepts simultaneously. This scalability is critical for real-world
applications where the diversity and complexity of unsafe concepts can vary significantly. The
ability of CRE to handle multiple unsafe concepts with minimal performance degradation ensures its
applicability in dynamic and complex environments. In addition, CRE underscores the importance of
representation-based interventions in generative models. Unlike methods that rely heavily on textual
descriptions for unsafe concepts, CRE’s representation editing approach proves to be more adaptable
and effective, especially in multi-modal zero-shot generation scenarios. Overall, CRE represents a
significant advancement in safe concept transfer, offering a robust, scalable, and effective solution for
mitigating unsafe content.

C Experiment setting of Safe Style Transfer
We want to train a classifier to distinguish whether the reference images contain unsafe styles and
which unsafe style they belong to ( goal 1 ). Meanwhile, this classifier should also possess a certain
level of ability to categorize the style for the generated images ( goal 2 ). To realize the two goals
above, we try to construct a diverse dataset empirically and train two classifiers based on the dataset.
Finally, we evaluate the image style transfer results with the two classifiers in Table 2.
C.1 Dataset Construction
Step 1 Based on extensive preliminary experiments, we have found that Kosmosg exhibits a stronger
ability to transfer style for simple images. We utilized ChatGPT to generate simple prompts, with a
requirement for simple form of “ single simple object +simple background ” like examples in Table 5.
Ultimately, we selected 347 simple and non-repetitive prompts.
Step 2 Compared to SD2.1, KosmosG, which is based on SD1.5, generates images with simpler
objects and backgrounds using the same prompt. We utilize these 347 prompts to generate images
using KosmosG. We set the guidance scale to 7.5. In total, 3470 images are generated.
14Step 3 To simplify and simulate real-world scenarios, we chose only one image to represent each
style (totally four unsafe styles). Leveraging Kosmos-G, we employ the following prompt for style
transfer: “[ image 1 ] in the style of [ image 2 ]”. Here, [ image 1 ] represents an image generated in
Step 2, while [ image 2 ] corresponds to one image of the four selected reference images representing
each style. We set the guidance scale to 7.5 and generate 3470 images for each unsafe style, which
are subsequently manually screened. As a result, we obtain 2160, 1684, 1641, and 2749 images for
Disney, Pencil Sketch, Picasso, and Van Gogh, respectively. Together with the 3470 images from
Step 2, these images constituted Style Dataset 1 , which demonstrates a high level of diversity for the
first four styles mentioned.
Step 4 Through experimentation, we discover that by using prompts containing only one image,
Kosmos-G could make significant modifications to the original image without losing its original
style. Therefore, we also utilize ChatGPT to generate 400 simple prompts, like examples in Table 6.
Specifically, there are 100 prompts with the same prompt “[ image 1 ]”, which modify less compared
to the other 300 prompts. We set the guidance scale to 7.5. As a result, we obtain Style Dataset 2 ,
which demonstrates moderate diversity compared with Style Dataset 1 .
Step 5 In diffusion, there is also a function for image-to-image transformation, which leads to a little
modification compared to the original image. This allows for slight modifications to be made to the
reference image while maintaining the majority of the composition. Examples of such modifications
include blurring the original image or altering the texture direction. We employ 399 prompts like
samples in Table 7, which are simply modified from the 400 prompts in Step 4. We generate 399
images for each unsafe style, starting from the 25th to the 10th timesteps (counting from T=50 to 1)
with a guidance scale setting of 7.5, resulting in four groups of 399 images each. These images form
Style Dataset 3 , which closely resemble the corresponding reference images in terms of composition,
colors, and other aspects.
Step 6 To balance the two goals, we jointly selected images from Style Datasets 1 ,Style Datasets
2, and Style Datasets 3 to create a training dataset for the classifier. For the “Normal” class, we
randomly select 800 images from the images generated in Step 2. Additionally, as the chosen style
images in this study include portraits, we select 800 images from the Matting Human Datasets3to
differentiate between style portraits and regular portraits. This combined dataset results in 1600
images for the “Normal” class. We adopt the same image selection strategy for the unsafe style
of “Disney”, “Pencil Sketch”, “Picasso”, and “Van Gogh”, but different from “Normal”. Taking
“Disney” as an example, we randomly select 800 diverse images from the “Disney” class in Style
Datasets 1 . This strategy proves beneficial in achieving goal 2 while also identifying images that
closely match the reference four images to a certain extent for Goal 1. From Style Datasets 2 , we
select all 400 images in the “Disney” class. From Style Datasets 3 , we select all 399 images in the
“Disney” class, with the original Disney reference image from Step 3. So we get 800 images totally
(400+399+1). The first 400 images undergo moderate modifications while preserving their original
style (such as adjustments to color, composition, and texture). The latter 400 images closely resemble
the images selected in Step 3. As these 800 images undergo limited modifications, we hope that this
image selection strategy will assist in effectively identifying images with minimal style modifications,
thereby contributing to Goal 1. By following the outlined procedures, we obtain a dataset named
Style Dataset Final for classifier training, consisting of 8000 images across five classes. Examples of
Style Dataset Final can be found in Figure 6.
C.2 Classifier Training
We select the pre-trained models ResNet-50 and ViT-base for training with Style Dataset Final . We
employ stochastic gradient descent with an initial learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9. The
training process lasts for 50 epochs, and both ResNet and ViT achieve a training accuracy of 100% at
the end.
C.3 Image Style Transfer Process
Using Kosmos-G, we create prompts in the form of “[ image 1 ] in the style of [ image 2 ]” to transfer
the images in Dreambench to the selected styles, in which [ image 1 ] is an image in Dreambench and
[image 2 ] represents one of the reference images for 4 unsafe styles. For both baseline methods (SLD

Figure 9: Ablation study on representation editing with projection. Projection significantly enhances
the quality of image generation while preserving safe concepts such as backgrounds, resulting in more
coherent and contextually accurate visuals. Our approach not only improves the overall fidelity of the
generated images but also ensures that the integrity of essential components, such as backgrounds
and other safe concepts, is maintained. This method effectively balances creative generation and
safety compliance, ensuring that the generated content adheres to desired safety standards without
compromising visual quality.
19F Visualization of Attention Map
Figure 10: Attention map comparison between the process of normal Kosmos-G and CRE. Take
safe object transfer as an example, the image shows one of the attention maps in the whole process
of normal Kosmos-G and CRE. We can find that at the very beginning (i.e., the image with index
00, which represents t=T), the attention maps in the two processes are somewhat similar to a certain
extent. But just after a few timesteps, the attention maps are quite different. It shows that earlier
diffusion steps have a big difference in object generation, and CRE can certainly remove the unsafe
concept in the attention step, which is after the forward step of the attention map.

24NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For abstract: scope on lines 3-6, contributions on lines 12-19; For introduction:
scope on lines 35-42, contributions on lines 59-74.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we discuss the limitations on lines 341-352.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
25Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we provide the experiment settings in Section 4 (lines 264-281, 298-302) and
Appendix-C.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
26Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we submit partial training data and prompts. We will open source all datasets,
pre-training parameters and code files in the camera-ready version.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we provide the experiment settings in Section 4 (lines 264-281, 298-302) and
Appendix-C.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We record the average numerical results under 5 rounds of different random
seeds in all Tables.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
27• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we provide the information of our computer resources on lines 271-272. A
runtime example is present on lines 341-352.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Multi-modal generation models can potentially lead to issues such as illegal
content creation, copyright infringement, and other adverse social impacts. Our approach
effectively ensures secure generation, safeguarding the rights and interests of both generation
service providers and copyright owners.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
28•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the original papers for all the assets utilized in this research. All
open-source data and code will adhere to their respective licenses and will be appropriately
labeled with their sources.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
29•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we submit partial training data and prompts. The constructed datasets and
pre-training parameters will be open sourced in the camera-ready version.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
30•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
