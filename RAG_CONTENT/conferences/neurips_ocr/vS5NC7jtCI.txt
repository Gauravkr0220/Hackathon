Abstract
Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are effective at
identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative labels as guidance.
However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often
results in semantic misalignments, as these text labels may not accurately reﬂect
the actual space of OOD images. To overcome this issue, we introduce adaptive
negative proxies , which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring
actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space
and enhance the efﬁcacy of negative proxy guidance. Speciﬁcally, our approach
utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from
test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation
of proxies that can better align with speciﬁc OOD datasets. While task-adaptive
proxies average features to reﬂect the unique characteristics of each dataset, the
sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to individual test
samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The ﬁnal score for identifying
OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies,
effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance.
Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed.
Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, abbreviated as AdaNeg. Notably, on the large-scale ImageNet
benchmark, our AdaNeg signiﬁcantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.45%
increase in AUROC and a 6.48% reduction in FPR95. Codes are available at

1 Introduction
In real applications, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems often encounter test samples of unknown
classes, termed out-of-distribution (OOD) data. These OOD data often result in overly conﬁdent
errors [ 52,44], posing security threats. Therefore, accurately identifying OOD data is essential for
ensuring the reliability and security of AI systems in open-world environments.
Traditional OOD detection methods in image domain primarily rely on vision-only models [ 20,33,36].
Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD
detection performance by leveraging multi-modal knowledge [ 17,15,39]. Recently, NegLabel [ 27]
explores negative labels by identifying text labels that are semantically distant from the in-distribution
(ID) labels. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance by detecting test images closer to
negative labels as OOD. In other words, NegLabel regards these negative labels as proxies of OOD
data. However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often leads to
semantic misalignment, where these text labels may not accurately reﬂect the actual label space

of OOD images, as shown in Fig. 1. This misalignment between the proxies and targeted OOD
distribution leads to sub-optimal performance.
To promote the alignment between the negative proxies and target OOD distribution, we introduce the
Adaptive Negative proxies ( AdaNeg ), which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring
actual OOD images. Speciﬁcally, we start by initializing an empty category-split memory bank for
each OOD dataset and selectively cache features of discriminative OOD images during testing. The
OOD discrimination is assessed using mined negative labels, as detailed in [ 27]. With this feature
memory, we develop task-adaptive proxies by simply averaging cached features within each category.
These proxies, derived from actual OOD images, reﬂect the distinct characteristics of the target OOD
dataset and align more closely with the underlying OOD label space.
The task-adaptive proxies mentioned previously provide unique proxies for different OOD datasets
while maintaining consistency across various test samples within the same dataset. To delve into the
ﬁne-grained nuances at the sample level, we introduce the sample-adaptive proxies by weighting
cached features based on their similarity to a particular test sample. This is achieved with an attention
mechanism, where the feature memory serves as both keys and values, and the test feature acts as the
query. The ﬁnal score for detecting OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our adaptive
proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance.
We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of AdaNeg,
where our proposed adaptive proxies outperform the negative-label-based one, enhancing performance
with complementary multi-modal knowledge. Particularly, on the large-scale ImageNet dataset, our
AdaNeg method outperforms existing methods by 2.45% AUROC and 6.48% FPR95. Notably, our
method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed, as analyzed in Tab.
4. The ability to dynamically adjust to new OOD datasets without affecting testing speed or labor-
intensive annotation/training makes our approach particularly valuable for real-world applications
where adaptability and efﬁciency are crucial. We summarize our contribution as follows:
We ﬁrst identify the label space misalignment between existing negative-label-based proxies
and the target OOD distributions. In response, we introduce adaptive negative proxies that
are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, resulting in a
more effective alignment with the OOD label space.
Our adaptive negative proxies are constructed with a feature memory bank that selectively
caches discriminative image features during testing. We instantiate this concept by devel-
oping task-adaptive proxies to reﬂect the unique characteristics of each OOD dataset and
2sample-adaptive proxies to capture detailed sample-level nuances. The ﬁnal OOD detection
score combines these insights with complementary textual and visual knowledge.
We conduct thorough analyses of the proposed components and perform extensive exper-
iments on standard benchmarks. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it
maintains fast testing speed and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method
signiﬁcantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.54% increase in AUROC and a 6.48%
reduction in FPR95 on the large-scale ImageNet dataset.
2 Related Work
OOD Detection focuses on identifying OOD test samples with semantic shifts, thus distinguishing
it from generalization studies which typically focus on covariate shifts [ 3–5,75]. A variety of
OOD detection techniques have been developed, which can be roughly categorized into score-based
[20,33,36,37,66,26,64,56], distance-based [ 58,59,57,12,41,53], and generative-based [ 50,29]
methods. Among them, score-based methods are particularly notable by employing a variety of
scoring functions to differentiate between ID and OOD samples. These functions include conﬁdence-
based [ 20,36,56,64], discriminator-based [ 29], energy-based [ 37,66], and gradient-based [ 25]
scores. In contrast, distance-based methods determine OOD samples by evaluating the distance in the
feature space between test data and the closest ID samples [ 58] or ID prototypes [ 59], using metrics
such as KNN [57, 12, 41] or Mahalanobis distance [33, 53].
Despite their achievements, traditional OOD detection methods generally rely on manually annotated
ID images and often overlook the integration of textual information. To leverage the textual knowl-
edge, recent advancements have focused on employing VLMs [ 39,40,27,77,76,15,42,65,45].
Speciﬁcally, ZOC [ 15] applies VLMs to discern OOD instances by training a captioner that generates
potential OOD labels. Nevertheless, this captioner often fails to produce effective OOD labels,
particularly for ID datasets containing many classes. LoCoOp [ 42] adopts a novel approach by
learning ID prompts from few-shot ID samples, and further enhances the robustness of these prompts
by incorporating OOD features mined from the backgrounds of images. CLIPN [ 65], LSN [ 45]
and LAPT [ 76] explore learning text prompts for expressing negative concepts. In speciﬁc, CLIPN
initializes text prompts with the word ‘no’ combined with ID labels and reﬁnes them with large-scale
multi-modal data; LSN starts with manually collected ID samples to learn negative prompts, offering
a different approach to leveraging textual information in OOD detection; LAPT conducts automated
prompt tuning with automatically collected training samples, boosting OOD detection without any
manual effort. MCM [ 39] utilizes ID class names to facilitate effective zero-shot OOD detection. It is
further reﬁned by NegLabel [ 27], which incorporates additional negative class names mined from
available data sources as negative proxies. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1, there is a mismatch be-
tween the negative-label-based proxies and the target OOD distribution, underscoring the limitations
of this strategy. This observation has inspired us to construct adaptive proxies by exploring potential
OOD test images during testing. This leads to an efﬁcient method that aligns better with the target
OOD distribution, resulting in enhanced OOD detection performance.
Furthermore, we clarify the relationship between our method and existing approaches on OOD
exposure [ 17,21,73]. Most OOD exposure methods introduce manually collected negative images
during training, where manual labor is necessary to ensure that the labels of negative images are
different from ID ones. Moreover, involving negative images in training typically introduces additional
computational overhead, impeding its practical deployment. Unlike these methods, NegLabel [ 27] is
exposed to negative labels during the test phase in a training-free manner. However, given a ﬁxed ID
dataset, the exposed negative texts remain consistent for different OOD datasets, inevitably resulting
in label misalignment, as shown in Fig. 1. To address this, we expose the VLMs to adaptive negative
proxies, which explore actual OOD samples during testing and align more effectively with OOD
distribution. Our method does not require manual annotations and works in a training-free manner,
making it an appealing solution for real applications.
Test-time Adaptation. We adopt an online update of the negative proxies during testing, resembling
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods [ 35,63,54]. Existing TTA methods primarily address covariate
shifts between training and testing domains. In contrast, our approach mitigates the label shift
between negative proxies and the target OOD distribution by exploring online test samples. Recently,
TTA strategies have been considered in the ﬁeld of OOD detection. However, these methods typically
require test-time optimization [ 18,72,16], slowing down the testing process. In contrast, our method

is optimization-free and introduces only a lightweight memory interaction operation, enabling rapid
and accurate testing, as analyzed in Tab. 4.
Memory Networks. The use of memory networks for storing and retrieving past knowledge [ 67,55]
has been extensively applied across various ﬁelds, including classiﬁcation [ 28,51,77], segmentation
[46,69], detection [ 8,6], and NLP [ 47]. To our best knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to apply memory
networks to the ﬁeld of OOD detection. By caching and retrieving test images with a feature memory,
we propose adaptive proxies to more effectively align with the OOD distribution in a training-free
manner. This innovative approach signiﬁcantly enhances the OOD detection performance.
3 Methodology
3.1 Preliminaries
OOD Detection Setup. ConsiderXas the image domain and Y=fy1;:::;yCgas the space of ID
class labels, where Ycomprises text elements such as Y=fcat;dog;:::;birdg, andCrepresents
the total number of classes. Let xinandxoodbe random variables representing ID and OOD samples
fromX, respectively. We deﬁne PxinandPxoodas the marginal distributions for ID and OOD,
respectively. In conventional classiﬁcation scenarios, it is assumed that the test image xoriginates
from the ID and is associated with a speciﬁc ID label, speciﬁcally, x2Pxinandy2Y, with
ybeing the label of x. However, in real applications, AI systems often face data from unknown
classes, denoted by x2Pxoodandy =2Y. Such occurrences can make AI models incorrectly
categorize these instances into familiar ID categories with substantial certainty [ 52,44], resulting in
security concerns. To address these challenges, OOD detection is proposed to accurately categorize
ID samples into their respective classes and reject OOD samples as non-ID. Recognition within the
ID categories is performed using a C-way classiﬁer, following standard classiﬁcation approaches
[31,19]. Concurrently, OOD detection typically employs a scoring mechanism S[33,36,37] to
differentiate between ID and OOD inputs:
G(x) =ID, ifS(x);otherwise,G(x) =OOD; (1)
whereGrepresents the OOD detector set at a threshold 2R. The test sample xis identiﬁed as an
ID sample if and only if S(x).
CLIP and NegLabel. For an ID test image xwithin the label space Y, we derive the image feature
vector v=fimg(x)2RDand the text feature matrix Cid=ftxt((Y))2RCDusing pre-trained
CLIP encoders, where Drepresents the feature dimension. The functions fimg()andftxt()are the
encoders for images and text, respectively. The function ()is the text prompt mechanism, typically
deﬁned as ‘a photo of a <label>.’, where label is the actual class name, for example, ‘cat’ or ‘dog’.
BothvandCidundergoL2normalization across the dimension D. Then, zero-shot classiﬁcation
probabilities are computed utilizing Cas the classiﬁer:
pid= Softmax( vCT
id=)2RC; (2)
4where >0is the scaling temperature.
The vanilla CLIP is proposed for zero-shot ID recognition and has recently been extended to
OOD detection. Speciﬁcally, the NegLabel approach [ 27] introduces negative class names Y =
fyC+1;:::;yC+Mgsourced from broad text corpora, where Mis the length of negative classes and
Y \Y=;. Then, we can obtain the full text feature matrix C=ftxt((Y[Y ))2R(C+M)D
with the pre-trained CLIP text encoder, leading to the classiﬁcation probability across C+Mclasses:
p= Softmax( vCT=)2RC+M: (3)
Assuming that ID samples exhibit greater similarity to ID labels and lesser similarity to negative
labels compared to OOD samples, NegLabel introduces the following score for OOD detection:
Snl(v) =CX
i=1pi; (4)
where piis thei-th entry of p, indicating the classiﬁcation probability of the i-th class. Intuitively,
the NegLabel method uses negative labels as proxies of the OOD distribution, detecting OOD images
based on the similarity to these negative labels.
3.2 AdaNeg
Although NegLabel has successfully employed negative labels as the OOD proxies, there is a semantic
misalignment between such OOD proxies and actual OOD labels, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We aim
to obtain OOD proxies that align better to the targeted OOD distribution. However, acquiring such
OOD proxies is challenging, as the OOD information is unknown prior to actual testing.
From another perspective, we can access real OOD information during testing, motivating us to reﬁne
OOD proxies in the testing stage. We can identify discriminative negative images during testing and
then adjust the OOD proxies toward detected images. This is achieved by selectively caching features
of test images into a task-aware memory bank, followed by memory reading operations to produce
adaptive proxies. We detail our implementation as follows.
Task-aware Memory. We construct a task-aware memory as a category-split tensor M2
R(C+M)LD, whereLis the memory length for each category. Mis initialized with zero values
and gradually ﬁlled with features of selected images during testing. Speciﬁcally, for a test image with
feature v, we ﬁrst calculate its score Snl(v)with Eq. (4). If Snl(v)<, we detect this test point
as a negative image, and otherwise, it is identiﬁed as a positive sample. For negative and positive
images, we respectively identify their closest labels as:
Negative :y= arg max
ipood
i+C; (5)
Positive :y= arg max
ipid
i; (6)
where pood=p[C:C+M]andpid=p[0 :C]are the classiﬁcation probabilities corresponding to
negative and ID class names, respectively. Then, we cache this feature vinto the task-aware memory:
My;l=v; (7)
wherelindicates an empty slot of My2RLD. Once Myis ﬁlled, we drop the image feature with
the highest prediction entropy, as detailed in Appendix A.2. In one word, we keep conﬁdent image
features with low prediction entropy in the memory.
The aforementioned strategy attempts to cache all test images, including those with high confusion
between ID and OOD. However, we found that selectively retaining only those image features that
exhibit strong ID/OOD distinguishing capabilities can effectively reduce this confusion. Speciﬁcally,
we modify the selection criterion for memorization as follows:
Negative :Snl(v)<!Snl(v)< g;
Positive :Snl(v)!Snl(v)+g(1 ); (8)
whereg2[0;1]is a hyperparameter that introduces a gap in the score space. Consequently, image
features falling within the gap  gSnl(v)<  +g(1 )are considered to have low
distinguishing conﬁdence and are not cached.

R(C+M)(L+1)Dis the extended memory with vanilla text proxies C. Such a memory extension
is necessary since Mis initially empty and uninformative. Initially, this extension initializes the
adaptive proxies Ctawith the basic text proxies C. However, there are two key distinctions between
the adaptive Ctaand the vanilla C. First, unlike the NegLabel approach, which employs a ﬁxed
proxyCacross various OOD datasets, our Ctadynamically adjusts to the targeted OOD domain as
the memory accumulates data, thereby providing dataset-speciﬁc adaptive proxies. Second, the Cta
primarily incorporates image features, offering modal knowledge that complements the text-based
proxies C. The beneﬁts of this approach are further analyzed in Tab. 3.
The score function for OOD detection with the task-adaptive proxy Ctais derived as:
Sta(v) =PC
i=1ecos(v;cta
i)=
PC
i=1ecos(v;cta
i)=+PC+M
j=C+1ecos(v;cta
j)=; (10)
where cos(;)measures the cosine similarity, and cta
iis thei-th entry of Cta.
Sample-adaptive Proxies. As evidenced in Table 3, our task-adaptive proxies signiﬁcantly out-
perform the ﬁxed text proxies by effectively adapting to the characteristics of target OOD dataset.
Building on this success, we further reﬁne our approach by leveraging ﬁner-grained, sample-level
nuances to introduce even more effective sample-adaptive proxies. Speciﬁcally, given the extended
memorycMand the test image feature v, we introduce the sample-adaptive proxy Csa2R(C+M)D
via the following cross-attention operation:
csa
i= L 2
'
v(cMi)>
cMi
2RD; (11)
where v(cMi)>2R1(L+1)measures the cosine similarities between normalized features of vand
cMi, and'(x) = exp( (1 x))modulates the sharpness of xwith hyper-parameter .csa
iand
cMiare thei-th entry of CsaandcM, respectively.
Both the task-adaptive and the sample-adaptive proxies are derived from the memorized image
features stored in cM. The primary distinction between them lies in their respective weighting
strategies. For Cta, each featurecM:;l;:in the memory is assigned a uniform weighting coefﬁcient
of1
L+1. Conversely, in constructing Csa, the weighting coefﬁcient for each cached feature is
dynamically determined based on its cosine similarity to the test image feature, denoted as v(cMi)>.
Consequently, while Ctaremains constant across different test samples, Csaadapts to each individual
test sample. This adaptability allows Csato tailor its response based on the speciﬁc characteristics
6of each test image, thereby enhancing discrimination between ID and OOD samples, particularly in
diverse and variable testing scenarios.
The score function for OOD detection with the sample-adaptive proxies Csais derived as:
Ssa(v) =PC
i=1ecos(v;csa
i)=
PC
i=1ecos(v;csa
i)=+PC+M
j=C+1ecos(v;csa
j)=: (12)
Multi-modal Score. As previously discussed, the score function Snl(v)relies primarily on text
features, whereas the sample-adaptive score function Ssa(v)utilizes cached image features. Given the
complementary nature of text and image modalities, we derive the ﬁnal score function by integrating
knowledge from both modalities:
Sall(v) =Snl(v) +Ssa(v); (13)
where>0is the hyperparameter balancing the two modalities. The overall pipeline of our method
is illustrated in Fig. 2 and summarized in Algorithm 1.
4 Experiments
4.1 Setup
Datasets. We conduct extensive experiments with the large-scale ImageNet-1k [ 9] as ID data.
Following prior practice [ 26,39,27], four OOD datasets of iNaturalist [ 60], SUN [ 68], Places [ 78],
and Textures [ 7] are evaluated. We also validate our method on the OpenOOD benchmark [ 74,71],
where OOD datasets are grouped into near-OOD ( e.g., SSB-hard [ 62], NINCO [ 2]) and far-OOD
(e.g., iNaturalist [ 60], Textures [ 7], OpenImage-O [ 64]) according to their similarity to ImageNet
dataset. Besides ImageNet, we also evaluate our method on smaller-sized CIFAR10/100 datasets [ 30]
with the OpenOOD setup. Speciﬁcally, with the ID dataset of CIFAR10/100, we adopt near-OOD
datasets of CIFAR100/10 and TIN [ 32], and far-ood datasets of MNIST [ 10], SVHN [ 43], Texture [ 7],
and Plances365 [ 78]. These experiments with various ID and OOD datasets enable a comprehensive
evaluation on various OOD settings.
Implementation Details. We adopt the visual encoder of VITB/16 pretrained by CLIP [ 48] and
analyze more backbone architectures in Tab. A11. For hyper-parameters, we adopt the memory
lengthL=10, threshold =0.5 with the gap g=0.5 in Eq. 8, =5.5 in Eq. 11, and =0.1 in Eq. 13 in
all experiments. These hyper-parameters are carefully analyzed in Sec. 4.3. Following NegLabel, we
adopt the text prompt of ‘The nice <label>.’, set temperature =0.01, and deﬁne the number Mof
negative labels as 10;000for the ImageNet dataset. For the CIFAR datasets, we set the number Mas
70;000since we ﬁnd that a larger Mleads to better results for CIFAR. Following common practice
[26,39,27], we employ the evaluation metrics of FPR95, AUROC, and ID ACC, which are detailed
in Appendix A.3. All experiments are conducted with a single Tesla V100 GPU.
4.2 Main Results
ImageNet Results with Four OOD Datasets. As illustrated in Tab. 1, our AdaNeg signiﬁcantly
outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses approaches requiring additional
training. Speciﬁcally, we report traditional methods [ 20,36,37,25,64,57,13,59] by ﬁne-tuning
CLIP-encoders with labeled training samples following [ 27], and report results of [ 45,42,27,34,1]
from their original paper. Compared to the closest competitor [ 27], our method achieves consistent
and notable improvements, validating the advantage of the proposed adaptive proxies over the
negative-label-based ones.
ImageNet Results with OpenOOD Setup. Our method is extensively evaluated against a range of
OOD datasets in Tab. 2 on the OpenOOD benchmark. Competing methods that require training are
referred from OpenOOD. These methods utilize the full ImageNet training set and hold an unfair
advantage over zero-shot, training-free methods like ours. Our AdaNeg consistently outperforms
its closest competitor [ 27] in both near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. Additionally, AdaNeg not
only enhances OOD detection capabilities but also improves ID classiﬁcation, presenting higher
robustness under diverse conditions.
Results on CIFAR10/100 datasets are provided in Appendix A.5, where our advantages still hold.

Score Functions. As illustrated in Tab. 3, the adaptive score functions StaandSsaconsistently
outperforms the ﬁxed Snl, validating the advantage of adaptive proxies over ﬁxed label proxies. The
sample-adaptive score Ssaslightly surpasses the task-adaptive one Sta, verifying the usefulness of
ﬁne-grained sample characteristics. Combining adaptive image-based proxies and ﬁxed text-based
proxies leads to the best performance, proving their complementarity.

Thresholdand gapgin Eq. 8. As illustrated in Fig. 3, employing a moderate threshold (e.g.,
0.4 << 0.6) proves effective in distinguishing OOD samples across various scenarios. However, the
efﬁcacy of the gap parameter gdepends upon the speciﬁc characteristics of different OOD datasets.
A largergfacilitates the identiﬁcation of more conﬁdently classiﬁed ID/OOD samples, thereby
improving the detection of far-OOD samples. Conversely, a smaller gis advantageous for near-OOD
detection as it accommodates low-conﬁdence OOD samples, which are typically more prevalent in
near-OOD scenarios.
In scenarios where the OOD distribution is entirely unknown, we adopt a conservative approach by
settinggto 0.5 in all experiments. This balanced setting provides a robust baseline for performance
across a variety of conditions. However, if prior knowledge regarding the difﬁculty levels of
OOD datasets is accessible, tailoring the hyperparameters—such as opting for a smaller gin more
challenging OOD contexts—can yield enhanced detection performance.
ID-OOD imbalanced Test Data. To investigate the stability of our method with imbalanced ID-OOD
test data, we construct test sets with various mixture ratios of ID and OOD samples. Speciﬁcally, we
adopted the 1.28M ImageNet training data as ID and randomly sampled 12.8K and 1.28K instances
from the SUN OOD dataset to construct the ID:OOD ratios of 100:1 and 1000:1 settings, respectively.
To construct the ID:OOD ratios of 1:100, 1:10, 1:1, and 10:1 settings, we randomly sampled 40K
samples from the SUN dataset as OOD and randomly sampled 400, 4K, 40K, and 400K instances
from the ImageNet training data. As shown in Tab. 5, our method outperforms NegLabel across a
wide range of mixture ratios (from 1:100 to 100:1), validating the robustness and reliability of our
approach. However, unbalanced mixture ratios do pose a challenge to our method. Our approach
performs the best in scenarios with a balanced mixture of ID and OOD samples, reducing the FPR95
by 11.18%. As the mixture ratio becomes increasingly unbalanced, the improvement brought by our
method gradually decreases. When the unbalanced ratio reaches 1000:1, our method shows some
negative impact.
After a more detailed analysis, we discovered that the fundamental issue stems from the increased
proportion of misclassiﬁed samples in the memory due to the growing ID-OOD imbalance. To
effectively address this problem, we reﬁne the selection criterion for memorizing OOD samples by
adaptively adjusting the gap g. We refer to this adaptive gap strategy as AdaGap, which signiﬁcantly
improves the robustness of our method against ID-OOD imbalanced test data, as demonstrated in
9Table 5: FPR95 (#) with different mixture ratios of ID and OOD samples.

Table 5. To summarize, we ﬁrst estimate the ratio of ID to OOD in the test data online. If there is a
higher proportion of ID/OOD compared to OOD/ID, we adjust the standards for caching ID/OOD
data into memory by dynamically modifying the gap in Eq. 8. For more detailed implementation,
please refer to the Appendix A.6.
Generalization to Other Domains. Besides experiments with natural images, we further validate
our method on the BIMCV-COVID19+ dataset [ 61], which includes medical images, following the
OpenOOD setup. Speciﬁcally, we select BIMCV as the ID dataset, which includes chest X-ray
images CXR (CR, DX) of COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. For the OOD datasets, we
follow the OpenOOD setup and use CT-SCAN and X-Ray-Bone datasets. The CT-SCAN dataset
includes computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals, while the
X-Ray-Bone dataset contains X-ray images of hands. As illustrated in Tab. 6, our AdaNeg method
consistently outperforms NegLabel on this medical image dataset.
Memory Length. As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, there is a positive correlation between the memory
lengthLand the performance outcomes, afﬁrming the efﬁcacy of feature memorization from another
perspective. In all our experiments, we have set Lto 10.
Complexity Analyses. As analyzed in Table 4, our AdaNeg approach does not introduce any
learnable parameters or require model training. Furthermore, it signiﬁcantly enhances performance
while maintaining a fast testing speed.
More analyses and discussions on the in Eq. 13,in Eq. 11, various backbone architectures, the
ordering of test samples, complementarity to training-based method, and the number of test data can
be found in Appendix A.6.
5 Conclusion and Limitations
We proposed adaptive negative proxies that aligned more effectively with OOD distributions, thereby
providing more effective guidance for OOD detection. These proxies were constructed using a
task-aware feature memory that selectively cached discriminative image features during testing.
Our approach facilitated the generation of both task-adaptive and sample-adaptive proxies through
carefully designed memory reading operations. Notably, our method was training-free and annotation-
free, and it maintained fast testing speed and achieved state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
These results validated the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive proxies.
One minor limitation of our method is the introduction of an external memory requirement. For
example, this memory occupies a storage space of 214.75MB when using the ImageNet dataset as
the ID, which may pose challenges for storage-constrained applications.

A Appendix
A.1 ID-Similarity to OOD Ratio with ground truth ID and OOD labels
We introduce the ID-Similarity to OOD Ratio (ISOR) to quantitatively measure the relative alignment
of negative proxies with ground truth OOD labels, compared to their alignment with ID labels. In
implementation, we adapt the score function of NegLabel ( i.e., Eq. 4), which originally measures the
similarity of a test image to ID labels over negative labels. We modify this function by replacing the
negative labels with ground truth OOD labels and changing the input from test images to negative
proxies ( e.g., negative texts), while keeping other aspects consistent with Eq. 4. This modiﬁed
score function allows us to assess the degree of similarity between the inputs and ground truth
ID/OOD labels, thereby quantifying the relative alignment between negative proxies and OOD labels.
Speciﬁcally, lower ISOR indicates a higher similarity to OOD labels and a reduced similarity to ID
labels.
A.2 Entropy-based caching strategy for full memory
The memory we construct is of ﬁnite length; hence, as the number of cached images increases, it
may become fully occupied. To address this, we have devised a simple strategy to retain only those
images with low entropy, e.g., high conﬁdence. Speciﬁcally, when storing an image in memory, we
also record its entropy pertinent to OOD detection:
Entropy( v) = Snl(v) log(Snl(v)) (1 Snl(v)) log(1 Snl(v)); (A.1)
whereSnl(v)represents the probability of belonging to the ID, as shown in Eq. (4). Given the entropy
of the current test image and a full memory My, we replace the item with the maximum entropy in
Mywith the current image feature if the current test image exhibits lower entropy. Otherwise, we do
not cache the current test sample.
A.3 Evaluation criteria
Following common practice [ 26,39,27], we employ the following three evaluation metrics: (1)
FPR95, which measures the false positive rate for OOD samples when the detection accuracy for ID
samples is at 95%; (2) AUROC, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; and (3) ID
ACC, which quantiﬁes the accuracy of correctly identifying and classifying ID samples.
A.4 Detailed results on ImageNet dataset under OpenOOD setting
The detailed OOD detection results on the OpenOOD benchmark are presented in Tab. A7.
A.5 Results on CIFAR10/100
As illustrated in Tab. A8, the advantage of our AdaNeg also holds on the CIFAR10/100 dataset.
Notably, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results in the far-OOD setting under a zero-shot
training-free manner, even outperforming its competitors training on the full labeled training set.

A.6 More analyses
Detailed Implementation of AdaGap Module. We have implemented an adaptive gap (AdaGap)
module to adjust the memorization selection criteria dynamically. This strategy builds on the
observation that as the score Snlincreases/decreases, the probability that a sample is ID/OOD also
increases accordingly. By enforcing a stringent selection criterion, we can effectively minimize the
inclusion of misclassiﬁed samples in our memory. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst online estimate the ratio
of ID to OOD samples in the test data using a First-In-First-Out queue, which caches the ID/OOD
estimation (cf. Eq. 8) of the most recent Nsamples:
MR =Estimated ID Number
Estimated ID Number + Estimated OOD number; (A.2)
where the ID and OOD numbers are acquired within the queue.
Leveraging the estimated mix ratio ( MR), we can dynamically adjust the gap gin memory caching
to avoid a majority of misclassiﬁed samples within the memory. For instance, if we ﬁnd that ID

samples constitute the majority of the test samples ( i.e.,MR > 0.5), this could lead to an increased
proportion of ID samples in the OOD memory. In response, we can adjust the selection criterion for
OOD memorization to only cache higher conﬁdence OOD samples. This adjustment is achieved by
modifying the selection criterion for memorization in Eq. 8 as follows:
Negative :Snl(v)< g!Snl(v)< max(g;MR );
Positive :Snl(v)+g(1 )!Snl(v)+ max(g;1 MR)(1 ); (A.3)
whereg= 0:5is the default gap analyzed in Figure 3b. In this way, under ID/OOD balanced
conditions ( i.e.,MR = 0.5), our method aligns with our original version. However, if the proportion
of ID samples is higher in the test samples’ estimation ( i.e.,MR > 0.5), we raise the standard for
storing negative samples in the memory. In an extreme case when MR = 1, we estimate that there
might be no OOD samples among the test samples; thus, we stop storing test samples in the negative
memory and only selectively cache test samples into the positive memory. We adjust our approach
conversely when the MR value is lower than 0.5.
Please note that the selection criterion is dynamically adjusted online because the MR is estimated
with the most recent Ntest samples. Here, we set N= 10;000by default. This dynamic adjustment
ensures that our memory caching strategy remains responsive to the evolving nature of the test sample
distribution, thereby optimizing memory utilization and enhancing the accuracy of our domain
distinction process.
in Eq. 13. As illustrated in Fig. A4a, the OOD detection performance remains robust across a wide
range ofvalues, e.g., from 0.01 to 1. For all experiments, we have set to 0.1.
in Eq. 11. Results with different values are shown in Fig. A4b, where OOD detection
performance is robust to the values. We adopt =5.5 in all experiments.
Ordering of Testing Data. Our AdaNeg selectively caches test data into memory, potentially
causing variations in the results depending on the ordering of the test data. To rigorously test this
17aspect, we randomly shufﬂed the order of the test data using three distinct seeds. We observed that
our method exhibits robustness to changes in the ordering of test data. Speciﬁcally, across three
experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset, the AUROC scores were 96.65%, 96.69%, and
96.64%, respectively, demonstrating ﬂuctuations of less than 0.1%. We report the average results
from three random runs in our paper.
Various Backbone Architectures. Results with various VLMs architectures are illustrated in Tab.
A11, where better results are typically achieved with stronger backbones.

1K is used as the ID dataset.

Complementarity to Training-based Method. We validated the complementarity between our
AdaNeg method and the latest works, NegPrompt [ 34] and LAPT [ 76], which use learned prompts.
As shown in Table A12, our method signiﬁcantly improves performance over these approaches,
demonstrating its complementarity with training-based methods.

Number of Testing Data. We examine the dependency of our approach on the number of test images
by evaluating its performance across different scales of test samples. As the number of test samples
increases (from 900 to 90K), the cached feature data also increases, leading to an improvement in our
method’s results, as shown in Tab. A13. Even with a small number of test samples ( e.g., 90 and 900),
our method signiﬁcantly reduces FPR95 compared to NegLabel, demonstrating its robustness across
different numbers of test images.
Note that with only 90 test images, the task of distinguishing between ID and OOD samples degener-
ates into a simpler task since the number of test images is even smaller than the number of classes
(e.g., 1000 for ImageNet). Consequently, both NegLabel and our method achieve lower FPR95 in
such an easier scenario.

sampled from ImageNet (ID) and SUN (OOD) datasets, and we maintain a consistent ratio of ID to
OOD samples at 5:4 throughout the experiments.

1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reﬂect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation:
Guidelines: This paper contributes the adaptive negative proxies for OOD detection, which
matches the main claims in the abstract and introduction.
The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reﬂect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
It is ﬁne to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Please refer to Sec. 5 in the main paper.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
19Justiﬁcation: The main contributions are the algorithm design and experimental validation.
No theory proofs are provided.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: We provide detailed algorithm designs in Sec. 3 and hyper-parameters in Sec
4.1 to facilitate reproducibility.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
20Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufﬁcient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: The adopted datasets are publicly available. Codes are available at https:
//github.com/YBZh/OpenOOD-VLM .
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: The proposed method does not require training, and the testing details are
illustrated in Sec 4.1.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Signiﬁcance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly deﬁned or other appropriate
information about the statistical signiﬁcance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: As analyzed in Sec. A.6 in the appendix, we examined the experimental results
on the ImageNet dataset with different orderings of the testing data. We found that the order
of the test data has a minimal impact on the ﬁnal results, e.g., the variation in three random
experiments was less than 0.1%, which veriﬁed the statistical stability of our method.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, conﬁ-
dence intervals, or statistical signiﬁcance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
21The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not veriﬁed.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
ﬁgures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufﬁcient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Our experiments can be reproduced with only one V100 GPU, as shown in
Sec. 4.1.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: I have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and conﬁrm that this paper conforms.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Positive Societal Impacts: The proposed method for OOD detection can
enhance the reliability and safety of AI systems, particularly in critical applications such
as healthcare, autonomous driving, and cybersecurity. By improving the detection of out-
of-distribution data, the system can better avoid potentially harmful decisions based on
22anomalous inputs, thereby increasing trust in AI technologies and their deployment in
various ﬁelds.
Negative Societal Impacts: One potential negative impact is the risk of privacy issues
due to online caching and processing of test data, which may inadvertently store sensitive
information. Additionally, the improved OOD detection might be misused in surveillance
and monitoring applications, leading to ethical concerns regarding privacy and autonomy.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact speciﬁc
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety ﬁlters.
Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: The used codes and datasets are well cited.
Guidelines:
23The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip ﬁle.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
Including this information in the supplemental material is ﬁne, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer:[NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
24Guidelines:
The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
We recognize that the procedures for this may vary signiﬁcantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
