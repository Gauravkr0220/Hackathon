Abstract
We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (V AR), a new generation paradigm
that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine “next-scale
prediction” or “next-resolution prediction”, diverging from the standard raster-scan
“next-token prediction”. This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive
(AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and can generalize well: V AR,
for the first time , makes GPT-style AR models surpass diffusion transformers in
image generation. On ImageNet 256 ×256 benchmark, V AR significantly improve
AR baseline by improving Fréchet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73,
inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with 20 ×faster inference speed. It is
also empirically verified that V AR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in
multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and
scalability. Scaling up V AR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to
those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near −0.998as solid
evidence. V AR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream
tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest
V AR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws
andzero-shot generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote
the exploration of AR/V AR models for visual generation and unified learning.

1 Introduction
The advent of GPT series [ 66,67,15,63,1] and more autoregressive (AR) large language models
(LLMs) [ 22,4,39,83,84,91,79,5,80] has heralded a new epoch in the field of artificial intelligence.
These models exhibit promising intelligence in generality and versatility that, despite issues like
hallucinations [ 40], are still considered to take a solid step toward the general artificial intelligence
(AGI). At the core of these models is a self-supervised learning strategy – predicting the next token in
a sequence, a simple yet profound approach. Studies into the success of these large AR models have
highlighted their scalability and generalizabilty : the former, as exemplified by scaling laws [44,36],
allows us to predict large model’s performance from smaller ones and thus guides better resource
allocation, while the latter, as evidenced by zero-shot and few-shot learning [ 67,15], underscores
the unsupervised-trained models’ adaptability to diverse, unseen tasks. These properties reveal AR
models’ potential in learning from vast unlabeled data, encapsulating the essence of “AGI”.
In parallel, the field of computer vision has been striving to develop large autoregressive or world
models [ 59,58,6], aiming to emulate their impressive scalability and generalizability. Trailblazing
efforts like VQGAN and DALL-E [ 30,68] along with their successors [ 69,92,51,99] have showcased
the potential of AR models in image generation. These models utilize a visual tokenizer to discretize
continuous images into grids of 2D tokens, which are then flattened to a 1D sequence for AR learning
(Fig. 2 b), mirroring the process of sequential language modeling (Fig. 2 a). However, the scaling laws
of these models remain underexplored, and more frustratingly, their performance significantly lags
behind diffusion models [ 64,3,52], as shown in Fig. 3. In contrast to the remarkable achievements
of LLMs, the power of autoregressive models in computer vision appears to be somewhat locked .

Figure 3: Scaling behavior of different model fami-
lies on ImageNet 256 ×256 generation benchmark. The
FID of the validation set serves as a reference lower
bound (1.78). V AR with 2B parameters reaches an FID
of 1.73, surpassing L-DiT with 3B or 7B parameters.Autoregressive modeling requires defining the
order of data. Our work reconsiders how to “or-
der” an image: Humans typically perceive or
create images in a hierachical manner, first cap-
turing the global structure and then local details.
This multi-scale, coarse-to-fine nature suggests
an “order” for images. Also inspired by the
widespread multi-scale designs [ 55,53,82,45],
we define autoregressive learning for images as
“next-scale prediction” in Fig. 2 (c), diverging
from the conventional “next-token prediction” in
Fig. 2 (b). Our approach begins by encoding
an image into multi-scale token maps. The au-
toregressive process is then started from the 1 ×1
token map, and progressively expands in resolu-
tion: at each step, the transformer predicts the
next higher-resolution token map conditioned on
all previous ones. We refer to this methodology
as Visual AutoRegressive (V AR) modeling.
2V AR directly leverages GPT-2-like transformer architecture [ 67] for visual autoregressive learning.
On the ImageNet 256 ×256 benchmark, V AR significantly improves its AR baseline, achieving a
Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 1.73 and an inception score (IS) of 350.2, with inference speed
20×faster (see Sec. 6 for details). Notably, V AR surpasses the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) – the
foundation of leading diffusion systems like Stable Diffusion 3.0 and SORA [ 29,14] – in FID/IS,
data efficiency, inference speed, and scalability. V AR models also exhibit scaling laws akin to those
witnessed in LLMs. Lastly, we showcase V AR’s zero-shot generalization capabilities in tasks like
image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. In summary, our contributions to the community include:
1.A new visual generative framework using a multi-scale autoregressive paradigm with next-scale
prediction, offering new insights in autoregressive algorithm design for computer vision.
2.An empirical validation of V AR models’ Scaling Laws and zero-shot generalization potential,
which initially emulates the appealing properties of large language models (LLMs).
3.A breakthrough in visual autoregressive model performance, making GPT-style autoregressive
methods surpass strong diffusion models in image synthesis for the first time2.
4.A comprehensive open-source code suite, including both VQ tokenizer and autoregressive model
training pipelines, to help propel the advancement of visual autoregressive learning.
2 Related Work
2.1 Properties of large autoregressive language models
Scaling laws are found and studied in autoregressive language models [ 44,36], which describe a
power-law relationship between the scale of model (or dataset, computation, etc.) and the cross-
entropy loss value on the test set. Scaling laws allow us to directly predict the performance of a
larger model from smaller ones [ 1], thus guiding better resource allocation. More pleasingly, they
show that the performance of LLMs can scale well with the growth of model, data, and computation
and never saturate, which is considered a key factor in the success of [ 15,83,84,98,91,39]. The
success brought by scaling laws has inspired the vision community to explore more similar methods
for multimodality understanding and generation [54, 2, 89, 27, 96, 78, 21, 23, 42, 32, 33, 81, 88].
Zero-shot generalization. Zero-shot generalization [ 73] refers to the ability of a model, particularly
a Large Language Model, to perform tasks that it has not been explicitly trained on. Within the realm
of the computer vision, there is a burgeoning interest in the zero-shot and in-context learning abilities
of foundation models, CLIP [ 65], SAM [ 49], Dinov2 [ 62]. Innovations like Painter [ 90] and LVM [ 6]
extend visual prompters [41, 11] to achieve in-context learning in vision.
2.2 Visual generation
Raster-scan autoregressive models for visual generation necessitate the encoding of 2D images
into 1D token sequences. Early endeavors [ 20,85] have shown the ability to generate RGB (or
grouped) pixels in the standard row-by-row, raster-scan manner. [ 70] extends [ 85] by using multiple
independent trainable networks to do super-resolution repeatedly. VQGAN [ 30] advances [ 20,85] by
doing autoregressive learning in the latent space of VQV AE [ 86]. It employs GPT-2 decoder-only
transformer to generate tokens in the raster-scan order, like how ViT [ 28] serializes 2D images into
1D patches. VQV AE-2 [ 69] and RQ-Transformer [ 51] also follow this raster-scan manner but use
extra scales or stacked codes. Parti [ 93], based on the architecture of ViT-VQGAN [ 92], scales the
transformer to 20B parameters and works well in text-to-image synthesis.
Masked-prediction model. MaskGIT [ 17] employs a VQ autoencoder and a masked prediction trans-
former similar to BERT [ 25,10,35] to generate VQ tokens through a greedy algorithm. MagViT [ 94]
adapts this approach to videos, and MagViT-2 [ 95] enhances [ 17,94] by introducing an improved
VQV AE for both images and videos. MUSE [16] further scales MaskGIT to 3B parameters.
Diffusion models ’ progress has centered around improved learning or sampling [ 77,76,56,57,7],
guidance [ 38,61], latent learning [ 71], and architectures [ 37,64,72,31]. DiT and U-ViT [ 64,8]
replaces or integrates the U-Net with transformer, and inspires recent image [ 19,18] or video synthesis
systems [12, 34] including Stable Diffusion 3.0 [29], SORA [14], and Vidu [9].
2A related work [95] named “language model beats diffusion” belongs to BERT-style masked-prediction model.
33 Method
3.1 Preliminary: autoregressive modeling via next-token prediction
Formulation. Consider a sequence of discrete tokens x= (x1, x2, . . . , x T), where xt∈[V]is
an integer from a vocabulary of size V. The next-token autoregressive posits the probability of
observing the current token xtdepends only on its prefix (x1, x2, . . . , x t−1). This unidirectional
token dependency assumption allows for the factorization of the sequence x’s likelihood:
p(x1, x2, . . . , x T) =TY
t=1p(xt|x1, x2, . . . , x t−1). (1)
Training an autoregressive model pθinvolves optimizing pθ(xt|x1, x2, . . . , x t−1)over a dataset.
This is known as the “next-token prediction”, and the trained pθcan generate new sequences.
Tokenization. Images are inherently 2D continuous signals. To apply autoregressive modeling to
images via next-token prediction, we must: 1) tokenize an image into several discrete tokens, and
2) define a 1D order of tokens for unidirectional modeling. For 1), a quantized autoencoder such
as [30] is often used to convert the image feature map f∈Rh×w×Cto discrete tokens q∈[V]h×w:
f=E(im), q =Q(f), (2)
where imdenotes the raw image, E(·)a encoder, and Q(·)a quantizer. The quantizer typically
includes a learnable codebook Z∈RV×Ccontaining Vvectors. The quantization process q=Q(f)
will map each feature vector f(i,j)to the code index q(i,j)of its nearest code in the Euclidean sense:
q(i,j)= 
arg min
v∈[V]∥lookup (Z, v)−f(i,j)∥2!
∈[V], (3)
where lookup (Z, v)means taking the v-th vector in codebook Z. To train the quantized autoencoder,
Zis looked up by every q(i,j)to get ˆf, the approximation of original f. Then a new image ˆimis
reconstructed using the decoder D(·)given ˆf, and a compound loss Lis minimized:
ˆf=lookup (Z, q), ˆim=D(ˆf), (4)
L=∥im−ˆim∥2+∥f−ˆf∥2+λPLP(ˆim) +λGLG(ˆim), (5)
where LP(·)is a perceptual loss such as LPIPS [ 97],LG(·)a discriminative loss like StyleGAN’s
discriminator loss [ 47], and λP,λGare loss weights. Once the autoencoder {E,Q,D}is fully trained,
it will be used to tokenize images for subsequent training of a unidirectional autoregressive model.
The image tokens in q∈[V]h×ware arranged in a 2D grid. Unlike natural language sentences with an
inherent left-to-right ordering, the order of image tokens must be explicitly defined for unidirectional
autoregressive learning. Previous AR methods [ 30,92,51] flatten the 2D grid of qinto a 1D sequence
x= (x1, . . . , x h×w)using some strategy such as row-major raster scan, spiral, or z-curve order.
Once flattened, they can extract a set of sequences xfrom the dataset, and then train an autoregressive
model to maximize the likelihood in (1) via next-token prediction.
Discussion on the weakness of vanilla autoregressive models. The above approach of tokenizing
and flattening enable next-token autoregressive learning on images, but introduces several issues:
1)Mathematical premise violation. In quantized autoencoders (VQV AEs), the encoder typically
produces an image feature map fwith inter-dependent feature vectors f(i,j)for all i, j. So
after quantization and flattening, the token sequence (x1, x2, . . . , x h×w)retains bidirectional
correlations. This contradicts the unidirectional dependency assumption of autoregressive
models, which dictates that each token xtshould only depend on its prefix (x1, x2, . . . , x t−1).
2)Inability to perform some zero-shot generalization. Similar to issue 1), The unidirectional
nature of image autoregressive modeling restricts their generalizability in tasks requiring bidi-
rectional reasoning. E.g., it cannot predict the top part of an image given the bottom part.
3)Structural degradation. The flattening disrupts the spatial locality inherent in image feature
maps. For example, the token q(i,j)and its 4 immediate neighbors q(i±1,j),q(i,j±1)are closely
correlated due to their proximity. This spatial relationship is compromised in the linear sequence
x, where unidirectional constraints diminish these correlations.
44)Inefficiency. Generating an image token sequence x= (x1, x2, . . . , x n×n)with a conventional
self-attention transformer incurs O(n2)autoregressive steps and O(n6)computational cost.
Issues 2) and 3) are evident (see examples above). Regarding issue 1), we present empirical evidence
in Appendix C. The proof of issue 3) is detailed in Appendix D. These theoretical and practical
limitations call for a rethinking of autoregressive models in the context of image generation.

Figure 4: V AR involves two separated training stages. Stage 1: a multi-scale VQ autoencoder encodes
an image into Ktoken maps R= (r1, r2, . . . , r K)and is trained by a compound loss (5). For details on
“Multi-scale quantization” and “Embedding”, check Algorithm 1 and 2. Stage 2: a V AR transformer is trained
via next-scale prediction (6): it takes ([s], r1, r2, . . . , r K−1)as input to predict (r1, r2, r3, . . . , r K). The
attention mask is used in training to ensure each rkcan only attend to r≤k. Standard cross-entropy loss is used.
3.2 Visual autoregressive modeling via next-scale prediction
Reformulation. We reconceptualize the autoregressive modeling on images by shifting from “next-
token prediction” to “next-scale prediction” strategy. Here, the autoregressive unit is an entire token
map, rather than a single token . We start by quantizing a feature map f∈Rh×w×CintoKmulti-scale
token maps (r1, r2, . . . , r K), each at a increasingly higher resolution hk×wk, culminating in rK
matches the original feature map’s resolution h×w. The autoregressive likelihood is formulated as:
p(r1, r2, . . . , r K) =KY
k=1p(rk|r1, r2, . . . , r k−1), (6)
where each autoregressive unit rk∈[V]hk×wkis the token map at scale kcontaining hk×wktokens,
and the sequence (r1, r2, . . . , r k−1)serves as the the “prefix” for rk. During the k-th autoregressive
step, all distributions over the hk×wktokens in rkwill be generated in parallel, conditioned on rk’s
prefix and associated k-th position embedding map. This “next-scale prediction” methodology is
what we define as visual autoregressive modeling (V AR), depicted on the right side of Fig. 4. Note
that in the training of V AR, a block-wise causal attention mask is used to ensure that each rkcan
only attend to its prefix r≤k. During inference, kv-caching can be used and no mask is needed.
Discussion. V AR addresses the previously mentioned three issues as follows:
1)The mathematical premise is satisfied if we constrain each rkto depend only on its prefix, that is,
the process of getting rkis solely related to r≤k. This constraint is acceptable as it aligns with
the natural, coarse-to-fine progression characteristics like human visual perception and artistic
drawing (as we discussed in Sec. 1). Further details are provided in the Tokenization below.
2)The spatial locality is preserved as (i) there is no flattening operation in V AR, and (ii) tokens in
eachrkare fully correlated. The multi-scale design additionally reinforces the spatial structure.
3)The complexity for generating an image with n×nlatent is significantly reduced to O(n4), see
Appendix for proof. This efficiency gain arises from the parallel token generation in each rk.
Tokenization. We develope a new multi-scale quantization autoencoder to encode an image to K
multi-scale discrete token maps R= (r1, r2, . . . , r K)necessary for V AR learning (6). We employ
the same architecture as VQGAN [ 30] but with a modified multi-scale quantization layer. The
encoding and decoding procedures with residual design on forˆfare detailed in algorithms 1 and
2. We empirically find this residual-style design, akin to [ 51], can perform better than independent
interpolation. Algorithm 1 shows that each rkwould depend only on its prefix (r1, r2, . . . , r k−1).
5Note that a shared codebook Zis utilized across all scales, ensuring that each rk’s tokens belong to
the same vocabulary [V]. To address the information loss in upscaling zktohK×wK, we use K
extra convolution layers {ϕk}K
k=1. No convolution is used after downsampling ftohk×wk.

4 Implementation details
V AR tokenizer. As aforementioned, we use the vanilla VQV AE architecture [ 30] and a multi-
scale quantization scheme with Kextra convolutions (0.03M extra parameters). We use a shared
codebook for all scales with V= 4096 . Following the baseline [ 30], our tokenizer is also trained on
OpenImages [50] with the compound loss (5) and a spatial downsample ratio of 16×.
V AR transformer. Our main focus is on V AR algorithm so we keep a simple model architecture
design. We adopt the architecture of standard decoder-only transformers akin to GPT-2 and VQ-
GAN [ 67,30] with adaptive normalization (AdaLN), which has widespread adoption and proven
effectiveness in many visual generative models [ 47,48,46,75,74,43,64,19]. For class-conditional
synthesis, we use the class embedding as the start token [s]and also the condition of AdaLN. We
found normalizing queries andkeys to unit vectors before attention can stablize the training. We do
not use advanced techniques in large language models, such as rotary position embedding (RoPE),
SwiGLU MLP, or RMS Norm [ 83,84]. Our model shape follows a simple rule like [ 44] that the
width w, head counts h, and drop rate drare linearly scaled with the depth das follows:
w= 64d, h =d, dr = 0.1·d/24. (7)
Consequently, the main parameter count Nof a V AR transformer with depth dis given by3:

All models are trained with the similar settings: a base learning rate of 10−4per 256 batch size, an
AdamW optimizer with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.95,decay = 0.05, a batch size from 768 to 1024 and
training epochs from 200 to 350 (depends on model size). The evaluations in Sec. 5 suggest that such
a simple model design are capable of scaling and generalizing well.
5 Empirical Results
This section first compares V AR with other image generative model families in Sec. 5.1. Evaluations
on the scalability and generalizability of V AR models are presented in Sec. 5.2 and Appendix B. For
implementation details and ablation study, please see Appendix 4 and Appendix 6.
5.1 State-of-the-art image generation
Setup. We test V AR models with depths 16, 20, 24, and 30 on ImageNet 256 ×256 and 512 ×512
conditional generation benchmarks and compare them with the state-of-the-art image generation
model families. Among all VQV AE-based AR or V AR models, VQGAN [ 30] and ours use the same
architecture (CNN) and training data (OpenImages [ 50]) for VQV AE, while ViT-VQGAN [ 92] uses
a ViT autoencoder, and both it and RQTransformer [ 51] trains the VQV AE directly on ImageNet.
The results are summaried in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2.
3Due to resource limitation, we use a single shared adaptive layernorm (AdaLN) acorss all attention blocks
in 512×512 synthesis. In this case, the parameter count would be reduced to around 12dw2+ 6w2≈49152 d3.

Overall comparison. In comparison with existing generative approaches including generative
adversarial networks (GAN), diffusion models (Diff.), BERT-style masked-prediction models (Mask.),
and GPT-style autoregressive models (AR), our visual autoregressive (V AR) establishes a new model
class. As shown in Tab. 1, V AR not only achieves the best FID/IS but also demonstrates remarkable
speed in image generation. V AR also maintains decent precision and recall, confirming its semantic
consistency. These advantages hold true on the 512 ×512 synthesis benchmark, as detailed in Tab. 2.
Notably, V AR significantly advances traditional AR capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first
time of autoregressive models outperforming Diffusion transformers, a milestone made possible by
V AR’s resolution of AR limitations discussed in Section 3.

V AR V AR- d36-s 2.63 303.2 1Efficiency comparison. Conventional autore-
gressive (AR) models [ 30,69,92,51] suffer a
lot from the high computational cost, as the num-
ber of image tokens is quadratic to the image
resolution. A full autoregressive generation of
n2tokens requires O(n2)decoding iterations
andO(n6)total computations. In contrast, V AR
only requires O(log(n))iterations and O(n4)to-
tal computations. The wall-clock time reported
in Tab. 1 also provides empirical evidence that
V AR is around 20 times faster than VQGAN
and ViT-VQGAN even with more model parame-
ters, reaching the speed of efficient GAN models
which only require 1 step to generate an image.
Compared with popular diffusion transformer. The V AR model surpasses the recently popular
diffusion models Diffusion Transformer (DiT), which serves as the precursor to the latest Stable-
Diffusion 3 [ 29] and SORA [ 14], in multiple dimensions: 1) In image generation diversity and quality
7(FID and IS), V AR with 2B parameters consistently performs better than DiT-XL/2 [64], L-DiT-3B,
and L-DiT-7B [ 3]. V AR also maintains comparable precision and recall. 2) For inference speed,
the DiT-XL/2 requires 45 ×the wall-clock time compared to V AR, while 3B and 7B models [ 3]
would cost much more. 3) V AR is considered more data-efficient, as it requires only 350 training
epochs compared to DiT-XL/2’s 1400. 4) For scalability, Fig. 3 and Tab. 1 show that DiT only obtains
marginal or even negative gains beyond 675M parameters. In contrast, the FID and IS of V AR are
consistently improved, aligning with the scaling law study in Sec. 5.2. These results establish VAR as
potentially a more efficient and scalable model for image generation than models like DiT .

Figure 5: Scaling laws with V AR transformer size N, with power-law fits (dashed) and equations (in legend).
Small, near-zero exponents αsuggest a smooth decline in both test loss Land token error rate Err when scaling
up V AR transformer. Axes are all on a logarithmic scale. The Pearson correlation coefficients near −0.998
signify a strong linear relationship between log(N)vs.log(L)orlog(N)vs.log(Err).
5.2 Power-law scaling laws
Background. Prior research [ 44,36,39,1] have established that scaling up autoregressive (AR) large
language models (LLMs) leads to a predictable decrease in test loss L. This trend correlates with
parameter counts N, training tokens T, and optimal training compute Cmin, following a power-law:
L= (β·X)α, (9)
where Xcan be any of N,T, orCmin. The exponent αreflects the smoothness of power-law, and L
denotes the reducible loss normalized by irreducible loss L∞[36] A logarithmic transformation to L
andXwill reveal a linear relation between log(L)andlog(X):
log(L) =αlog(X) +αlogβ. (10)
An appealing phenomenon is that both [ 44] and [ 36] never observed deviation from these linear
relationships at the higher end of X, although flattening is inevitable as the loss approaches zero.
These observed scaling laws [ 44,36,39,1] not only validate the scalability of LLMs but also serve
as a predictive tool for AR modeling, which facilitates the estimation of performance for larger
AR models based on their smaller counterparts, thereby saving resource usage by large model
performance forecasting. Given these appealing properties of scaling laws brought by LLMs, their
replication in computer vision is therefore of significant interest.
Setup of scaling V AR models. Following the protocols from [ 44,36,39,1], we examine whether
our V AR model complies with similar scaling laws. We trained models across 12 different sizes,
from 18M to 2B parameters, on the ImageNet training set [ 24] containing 1.28M images (or 870B
image tokens under our VQV AE) per epoch. For models of different sizes, training spanned 200 to
350 epochs, with a maximum number of tokens reaching 305 billion. Below we focus on the scaling
laws with model parameters Nand optimal training compute Cmingiven sufficient token count T.
Scaling laws with model parameters N.We first investigate the test loss trend as the V AR model
size increases. The number of parameters N(d) = 73728 d3for a V AR transformer with depth dis
specified in (8). We varied dfrom 6to30, yielding 12 models with 18.5M to 2.0B parameters. We
assessed the final test cross-entropy loss Land token prediction error rates Err on the ImageNet
validation set of 50,000 images [ 24]. We computed LandErr for both the last scale (at the last
next-scale autoregressive step), as well as the global average. Results are plotted in Fig. 5, where we

observed a clear power-law scaling trend for Las a function of N, as consistent with [ 44,36,39,1].
The power-law scaling laws can be expressed as:
Llast= (2.0·N)−0.23and Lavg= (2.5·N)−0.20. (11)
Although the scaling laws are mainly studied on the test loss, we also empirically observed similar
power-law trends for the token error rate Err:
Err last= (4.9·102N)−0.016and Err avg= (6.5·102N)−0.010. (12)
These results verify the strong scalability of V AR, by which scaling up V AR transformers can
continuously improve the model’s test performance.
Scaling laws with optimal training compute Cmin.We then examine the scaling behavior of V AR
transformers when increasing training compute C. For each of the 12 models, we traced the test loss
Land token error rate Err as a function of Cduring training quoted in PFlops ( 1015floating-point
operations per second). The results are plotted in Fig. 6. Here, we draw the Pareto frontier of Land
Err to highlight the optimal training compute Cminrequired to reach a certain value of loss or error.
The fitted power-law scaling laws for LandErr as a function of Cminare:
Llast= (2.2·10−5Cmin)−0.13(13)
Lavg= (1.5·10−5Cmin)−0.16, (14)
Err last= (8.1·10−2Cmin)−0.0067(15)
Err avg= (4.4·10−2Cmin)−0.011. (16)
These relations (14, 16) hold across 6 orders of magnitude in Cmin, and our findings are consistent
with those in [ 44,36]: when trained with sufficient data, larger V AR transformers are more compute-
efficient because they can reach the same level of performance with less computation.
6 Ablation Study
In this study, we aim to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed V AR framework.
Results are reported in Tab. 3.
Effectiveness and efficiency of V AR. Starting from the vanilla AR transformer baseline implemented
by [17], we replace its methodology with our V AR and keep other settings unchanged to get row 2.
9Table 3: Ablation study of V AR. The first two rows compare GPT-2-style transformers trained under AR or
V AR algorithm without any bells and whistles. Subsequent lines show the influence of V AR enhancements.
“AdaLN”: adaptive layernorm. “CFG”: classifier-free guidance. “Attn. Norm.”: normalizing qandkto unit
vectors before attention. “Cost”: inference cost relative to the baseline. “ ∆”: FID reduction to the baseline.

V AR achieves a way more better FID (18.65 vs.5.22) with only 0.013 ×inference wall-clock cost
than the AR model, which demonstrates a leap in visual AR model’s performance and efficiency.
Component-wise ablation. We further test some key components in V AR. By replacing the standard
Layer Normalization (LN) with Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN), V AR starts yielding better
FID than baseline. By using the top- ksampling similar to the baseline, V AR’s FID is further improved.
By using the classifier-free guidance (CFG) with ratio 1.5and normalizing qandkto unit vectors
before attention, we reach the FID of 3.30, which is 15.35 lower to the baseline, and its inference
speed is still 45 times faster. We finally scale up V AR size to 2.0B and achieve an FID of 1.73. This
is 16.85 better than the baseline FID.
7 Limitations and Future Work
In this work, we mainly focus on the design of learning paradigm and keep the VQV AE architecture
and training unchanged from the baseline [ 30] to better justify V AR framework’s effectiveness. We
expect advancing VQV AE tokenizer [99,60,95] as another promising way to enhance autoregressive
generative models, which is orthogonal to our work. We believe iterating V AR by advanced tokenizer
or sampling techniques in these latest work can further improve V AR’s performance or speed.
Text-prompt generation is an ongoing direction of our research. Given that our model is funda-
mentally similar to modern LLMs, it can easily be integrated with them to perform text-to-image
generation through either an encoder-decoder or in-context manner.
Video generation is not implemented in this work, but it can be naturally extended. By considering
multi-scale video features as 3D pyramids , we can formulate a similar “ 3D next-scale prediction ”
to generate videos via V AR. Compared to diffusion-based generators like SORA [ 14], our method
has inherent advantages in temporal consistency or integration with LLMs, thus can potentially
handle longer temporal dependencies. This makes V AR competitive in the video generation field,
because traditional AR models can be too inefficient for video generation due to their extremely
high computational complexity and slow inference speed: it is becoming prohibitively expensive to
generate high-resolution videos with traditional AR models, while V AR is capable to solve this. We
therefore foresee a promising future for exploiting V AR models in the realm of video generation.
8 Conclusion
We introduced a new visual generative framework named Visual AutoRegressive modeling (V AR) that
1) theoretically addresses some issues inherent in standard image autoregressive (AR) models, and
2) makes language-model-based AR models first surpass strong diffusion models in terms of image
quality, diversity, data efficiency, and inference speed. Upon scaling V AR to 2 billion parameters, we
observed a clear power-law relationship between test performance and model parameters or training
compute, with Pearson coefficients nearing −0.998, indicating a robust framework for performance
prediction. These scaling laws and the possibility for zero-shot task generalization, as hallmarks of
LLMs, have now been initially verified in our V AR transformer models. We hope our findings and
open sources can facilitate a more seamless integration of the substantial successes from the natural
language processing domain into computer vision, ultimately contributing to the advancement of
powerful multi-modal intelligence.
10A Visualization of scaling effect
To better understand how V AR models are learning when scaled up, we compare some generated
256×256samples from V AR models of 4 different sizes (depth 6, 16, 26, 30) and 3 different training
stages (20%, 60%, 100% of total training tokens) in Fig. 7. To keep the content consistent, a same
random seed and teacher-forced initial tokens are used. The observed improvements in visual fidelity
and soundness are consistent with the scaling laws, as larger transformers are thought able to learn
more complex and fine-grained image distributions.
Figure 7: Scaling model size Nand training compute Cimproves visual fidelity and soundness. Zoom in
for a better view. Samples are drawn from V AR models of 4 different sizes and 3 different training stages. 9
class labels (from left to right, top to bottom) are: flamingo 130, arctic wolf 270, macaw 88, Siamese cat 284,
oscilloscope 688, husky 250, mollymawk 146, volcano 980, and catamaran 484.

design and finetuning. Zoom in for a better view.
B Zero-shot task generalization
Image in-painting and out-painting. V AR- d30 is tested. For in- and out-painting, we teacher-force
ground truth tokens outside the mask and let the model only generate tokens within the mask. No
class label information is injected into the model. The results are visualized in Fig. 8. Without
modifications to the network architecture or tuning parameters, V AR has achieved decent results on
these downstream tasks, substantiating the generalization ability of V AR.
Class-conditional image editing. Following MaskGIT [ 17] we also tested V AR on the class-
conditional image editing task. Similar to the case of in-painting, the model is forced to generate
tokens only in the bounding box conditional on some class label. Fig. 8 shows the model can produce
plausible content that fuses well into the surrounding contexts, again verifying the generality of V AR.
Figure 9: Token dependency plotted. The normalized heat map of attention scores in the last self-attention
layer of VQGAN encoder is visualized. 4 random 256 ×256 images from ImageNet validation set are used.
12C Token dependency in VQV AE
To examine the token dependency in VQV AE [ 30], we check the attention scores in the self-attention
layer before the vector quantization module. We randomly sample 4 256 ×256 images from the
ImageNet validation set for this analysis. Note the self-attention layer in [ 30] only has 1 head so for
each image we just plot one attention map. The heat map in Fig. 9 shows the attention scores of each
token to all other tokens, which indicate a strong, bidirectional dependency among all tokens. This is
not surprising since the VQV AE model, trained to reconstruct images, leverages self-attention layers
without any attention mask. Some work [ 87] has used causal attention in self-attention layers of a
video V AE, but we did not find any image V AE work uses causal self-attention.
D Time complexity of AR and V AR generation
We prove the time complexity of AR and V AR generation.
Lemma D.1. For a standard self-attention transformer, the time complexity of AR generation is
O(n6), where h=w=nandh, w are the height and width of the VQ code map, respectively.
Proof. The total number of tokens is h×w=n2. For the i-th (1≤i≤n2) autoregressive iteration,
the attention scores between each token and all other tokens need to be computed, which requires
O(i2)time. So the total time complexity would be:
n2X
i=1i2=1
6n2(n2+ 1)(2 n2+ 1), (17)
Which is equivalent to O(n6)basic computation.
For V AR, it needs us to define the resolution sequense (h1, w1, h2, w2, . . . , h K, wK)for autoregres-
sive generation, where hi, wiare the height and width of the VQ code map at the i-th autoregressive
step, and hK=h, wK=wreaches the final resolution. Suppose nk=hk=wkfor all 1≤k≤K
andn=h=w, for simplicity. We set the resolutions as nk=a(k−1)where a >1is a constant
such that a(K−1)=n.
Lemma D.2. For a standard self-attention transformer and given hyperparameter a >1, the time
complexity of VAR generation is O(n4), where h=w=nandh, w are the height and width of the
last (largest) VQ code map, respectively.
Proof. Consider the k-th (1≤k≤K) autoregressive generation. The total number of tokens of
current all token maps (r1, r2, . . . , r k)is:
kX
i=1n2
i=kX
i=1a2·(k−1)=a2k−1
a2−1. (18)
So the time complexity of the k-th autoregressive generation would be:
a2k−1
a2−12
. (19)
By summing up all autoregressive generations, we have:
loga(n)+1X
k=1a2k−1
a2−12
(20)
=(a4−1) log n+ 
a8n4−2a6n2−2a4(n2−1) + 2 a2−1
loga
(a2−1)3(a2+ 1) log a(21)
∼ O(n4). (22)
This completes the proof.

19NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes. Our main contributions are also detailed in Sec. 1. Also see Sec. 5 and
Appendix D for more theoretical and experimental evidence.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, please see Sec. 7 for limitations. We also reported a lot about computa-
tional efficiency, such as in Tab. 1 and Appendix D.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
20Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We detail the assumption and proof of theoretical result on time complexity in
Appendix D.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use publicly-accessable dataset ImageNet [ 24]. We upload the codes and
instructions to recover the results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
21Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use publicly-accessable dataset ImageNet [ 24]. We upload the codes
and instructions to recover the results. Once the blind review period is finished, we’ll
open-source all codes, instructions, and model checkpoints.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Sec. 5 and Appendix 4.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Due to the resource limitation, we do not report error bars. Please note that in
Sec. 5 we spent numerous resources (we trained 12 different models) for our scaling law
study, which makes it prohibitively to run each experiments for multiple times.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
22•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the training PFlops in Fig. 6 and speed in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [No]
Justification: This work focuses on a academic, publicly-available benchmark ImageNet.
This work is not related to any private or personal data, and there’s no explicit negative
social impacts.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
23•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not foresee any high risk for misuse of this work.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we credited them in appropriate ways.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
24•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
25•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
