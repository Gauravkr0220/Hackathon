Abstract
We explore optimally training protein language models, an area of significant
interest in biological research where guidance on best practices is limited. Most
models are trained with extensive compute resources until performance gains
plateau, focusing primarily on increasing model sizes rather than optimizing the
efficient compute frontier that balances performance and compute budgets. Our
investigation is grounded in a massive dataset consisting of 939 million protein
sequences. We trained over 300 models ranging from 3.5 million to 10.7 billion
parameters on 5 to 200 billion unique tokens, to investigate the relations between
model sizes, training token numbers, and objectives. First, we observed the effect of
diminishing returns for the Causal Language Model (CLM) and that of overfitting
for the Masked Language Model (MLM) when repeating the commonly used
Uniref database. To address this, we included metagenomic protein sequences in
the training set to increase the diversity and avoid the plateau or overfitting effects.
Second, we obtained the scaling laws of CLM and MLM on Transformer, tailored
to the specific characteristics of protein sequence data. Third, we observe a transfer
scaling phenomenon from CLM to MLM, further demonstrating the effectiveness
of transfer through scaling behaviors based on estimated Effectively Transferred
Tokens. Finally, to validate our scaling laws, we compare the large-scale versions
of ESM-2 and PROGEN2 on downstream tasks, encompassing evaluations of
protein generation as well as structure- and function-related tasks, all within less or
equivalent pre-training compute budgets.
1 Introduction
Scaling up transformer-based models has become a guiding principle for enhancing model perfor-
mance across broad domains, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [ 4,12,24,64,79]
and Computer Vision (CV) [ 20,67,89]. In recent years, large transformer-based Protein Language
Models (PLMs) such as PROGEN familiy [ 51,61], ESM familiy [ 68,47] and xTrimoPGLM [ 14]
have also been developed, which leads to significant improvements over model performance on
complex downstream tasks [ 27,45]. Current language models utilize two main training objectives to
encode sequence information: the BERT-like [ 23] Masked Language Model (MLM) and the GPT-like
Causal Language Model (CLM) [ 11], each applied either separately or in a unified fashion. A
common understanding is that bi-directionally MLM excels in sample efficiency and shows enhanced
performance in downstream task fine-tuning. This is particularly true in tasks that emphasize under-
standing complex patterns, making it a prevalent learning objective in modeling protein sequences *

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).[46,14]. On the other hand, uni-directional CLM, due to its sequential generation ability, is better
suited for generating more coherent and realistic sequences compared to MLM [19, 61, 63].
However, training large protein language models (PLMs) are computational-intensive, and strategies
for optimally allocating compute budgets for training PLMs are relatively underexplored, with most
efforts focusing on scaling model parameters based on a fixed set of training tokens to achieve
performance improvements . A key insight [ 36,42,76] is that large models should not be trained
to their lowest possible loss to optimize computing; instead, models and data should be scaled
proportionally based on available compute budgets. These scaling laws are broadly found in natural
language models [ 42,36,33,2,58,78,17,90]. But their applicability has not been validated within
biological datasets, such as the primary structures of proteins, which are composed of amino acid
sequences forming protein chains. Unlike natural languages, protein sequences are scientific data that
are precisely represented using a vocabulary of 20 amino acids, with very little redundancy and are
not as semantically smooth. Thus, we consider such data as a distinct modality and ask the question:
What are the scaling behaviors for MLM and CLM in protein language modeling?
We focus on the best practices, which include revisiting datasets, optimization objectives, and model
parameters as key factors. Our goal is to investigate an optimal training scheme for protein language
models given predetermined compute budgets. Our core findings are as follows:
•We revisited the protein sequence data used for training PLMs and collected a dataset of 194
billion unique tokens on 939M unique sequences from publicly available sources to address
the issue of overfitting and perform plateau in protein language modeling.
•We find that, in both MLM and CLM, training data scales sublinearly in the model sizes
but follow distinct power-laws. In other words, a 10 ×increase in compute leads to a 6 ×
increase in MLM model size and a 70% increase in data, versus a 4 ×increase in CLM
model size and a 3 ×increase in training tokens.
•We also find that models trained with CLM can be transferred to MLM. When given
a predetermined amount of computation, and one wants to obtain both a CLM and a
MLM model, there is a trade-off in allocating the training token to each model to jointly
optimize the performance of the two. Interestingly, the allocation for CLM pre-training was
determined by the scaling law of CLM and MLM, and the Effectively Transferred Tokens
Dtfrom CLM to MLM. Furthermore, we verify this method experimentally using a 470M
model and fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
•Building on our scaling strategies, we re-allocate of model size and training tokens under the
compute budgets of established PROGEN2-xlarge and ESM-2 (3B) setups. Consequently,
with the same compute budgets, we trained two corresponding models, one with 7.2B
parameters and the other with 10.7B parameters, which exhibited enhanced performance in
a diverse range of downstream tasks.
2 Scaling up data
First, we explore the effects of training PLMs across multiple epochs under token scarcity conditions.
We then introduce a dataset, UniMeta200B, used throughout this work. This dataset enhancement
alleviates the challenge of insufficient training for protein language models.
2.1 A Data-hungry Observation
Using the UniParc database with 250 million protein sequences, research on ESM [ 68] shows that
the datasets UR50/S and UR50/D, with 45M and 65M unique sequences respectively, outperform
Uniref100 in perplexity (PPL) on a ~670M parameter MLM model. These datasets contain ~15B and
~20B unique amino acid tokens. The ESM-2 family models, ranging from 150M to 15B parameters,
are trained extensively with nearly 1 trillion tokens over 45 epochs on the UR50/D dataset. In
observing the scaling of ESM-2 models, it becomes apparent that increasing model size to 15B
parameters from 3B shows marginal improvement. On the other hand, contemporary LLMs are often
trained for only one or a few epochs [ 43,36,79,80,11]. The repetition of data with limited unique
tokens has diminishing returns and hinders scaling model size [ 65,34,58,70]. This underscores
the importance of using rich datasets for training large-scale language models to ensure robust
performance across applications. We evaluated models with 150M and 3B parameters on the UR50/S
dataset, trained on 200B tokens, as shown in Figure 1. We focus on the Independent and Identically

test PPL, were tracked over 200 billion training tokens for both the 150M and 3B models. As we
scaled the model from 150M to 3B, we observed diminishing returns on CLM (First line) and a
tendency to overfit on MLM (Second line) when repeating the Uniref50 (UR50/S) dataset. We totally
evaluate 3 repeating methods on MLM 3B models, all of which present overfitting (see Appendix B).
Distributed (IID) validation and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) test PPL, which measures the model’s
randomness in amino acid selection. For our OOD dataset, we utilized the MMseqs2 tool [ 72]
to conduct searches within the UniRef90 database for sequences post-training dataset timestamp,
retaining those with no detectable identity. From these, a random sample of 3,000 sequences was
selected to constitute the OOD dataset. Notably, we do not adopt dropout regularization, a practice
that often reduces model capacity and is infrequently used in contemporary LLMs [ 43]. This choice
is consistent with recent LLM configuration findings [38], including ESM-2 [47].
The results show the 150M model lacks good generalization while increasing to a 3B model resulted
in diminishing returns for CLM and severe overfitting for MLM. Principally, the bidirectional self-
attention mechanisms used in MLM have a higher capacity to overfit compared to the unidirectional
self-attention used in CLM. This is because MLM can utilize the entire context surrounding a masked
token, leading to faster memorization of the training data.
2.2 Expanding Diversified Metagenomic Data

scarcity, we leveraged the Colab-

on metagenomic data sources such
as BFD [ 1], MGnify [ 57], and spe-
cific eukaryotic and viral datasets in-
cluding SMAG [ 22], MetaEuk [ 44],
TOPAZ [ 3], MGV [ 59], and GPD [ 13].
We applied a stringent deduplication
process with a maximum similarity
threshold of 0.3 to preserve the diver-
sity of the protein universe. Given that
the Uniref90 dataset has proven most
effective for pre-training across various Uniref clustering levels per ESM-1v [ 54], we incorporated
Uniref90/50 (Before 2022-12), which includes incremental data relative to Uniref50/S representatives.
ColabFoldDB cand ColabFoldDB mplay dominant roles within the dataset, corresponding to cluster
representatives and members, respectively. To ensure uniformity during training, we allocate weights
within each batch to allow each amino acid token to be evenly processed through the model. This
dataset, termed UniMeta200B, contains 939 million unique protein sequences and 194 billion amino
acids, which is an order of magnitude larger than UR50/D. We observed significant improvements
3in the OOD test set and a consistent learning curve on the IID validation subset extracted from
the training set (Figure 1). These enhancements not only ensure a controlled diversity to maintain
sample efficiency but also significantly increase the quantity and uniformity of data, facilitating model
scaling.†
Findings 1. Scaling the model from 150M to 3B, we noted diminishing returns for CLM and an
overfitting tendency for MLM when repeating the UR50/S dataset. The proposed Expanding
Diversified Metagenomic Data (UniMeta200B) addresses these problems.

Figure 2: IsoFLOPs curves and parametric fit for CLM and MLM. We selected training tokens
to ensure a uniform final FLOP count for different model sizes. The lowest loss of each curve
revealed an optimal model size for a FLOP budget ( above ). We use these rainbow points at the valley
to plot the efficient frontier for estimating the optimal model size and training tokens for scaling
models ( below ). The interval range was estimated by model points with similar loss.
In this section, we propose a scaling law for protein sequences with MLM and CLM objectives,
aiming at optimally balancing model size and data size under a fixed compute budget to improve
efficiency on expanded resources.

MLM 0.776 0 .230 6 .19×10−82.02×106We first fit our models in the form of a
fundamental power-law based on the
existing work [ 42,36,33,69,2,17,
90] in the field of LLMs. Specifically,
given a fixed FLOPs formula of C=
6×N×D, where Nrepresents the
number of forward-activated non-embedding parameters, and Dis the number of training tokens,
how should one navigate the trade-off between model size and the number of training tokens? The
†Appendix E compare the training performed separately on two datasets, and we find that the ColabFoldDB
does not affect downstream results.
4model parameters Nand data size Dcan be directly fit with a simple power-law:
N(C) =A×Cα, D (C) =B×Cβ(1)
We employed the IsoFLOPs profiling approach [ 36,9], setting 7 distinct training FLOP counts ranging
from 1×1018to1×1021. For each FLOP count, we selected models from a pool of candidates (see
Appendix N). Models were excluded if the estimated data size ( C/(6∗N)) resulted in more than
200B tokens or if the training steps were fewer than 20K. Ultimately, approximately 260 models
were used for fitting. We considered the final validation loss for each model to ensure that every
model completed a full cosine cycle with 10×learning rate decay. For each fixed FLOP count, we
employ smoothed loss to determine the optimal model size with the smallest loss (Figure 2 (above)).
Subsequently, we use Equation 1 and apply the least_squares method to fit the model. Given

the minimal variations in the final loss among a set of (N, D )configurations, we classify these
configurations as operating under "IsoLoss" conditions (see Appendix K Figure A15), considered
optimal for training. In Figure 2 (below), we illustrate an efficient frontier interval that demonstrates
permissible fluctuations in model size and dataset size at a specific FLOP count, while still achieving
nearly identical losses. The variation in loss is quantified at 0.25 on a logarithmic scale with a base
of 10. This indicates that within this FLOP counts, the model size can be adjusted within a range,
increasing up to 80% or decreasing up to 40% without repeating data, to maintain a loss variation
within 0.01.

Figure 3: Compute allocation for two
objectives with the same model size.We observe distinct growth rates in the proportional relation-
ship between model size and training tokens for the MLM
model compared to the CLM, as detailed in Table 2. Both
models demonstrate an increase in the growth of model size
that surpasses the growth of training tokens. Up to the inter-
section point around 1×1022(see Figure 2, left below), the
model size of MLM tends to be smaller than the CLM, there-
after, the MLM rapidly exceeds that of the CLM. Notably,
the growth of the MLM’s training tokens is greatly lower
than that for the CLM, possibly due to MLM’s higher sample
efficiency. For instance, if the compute budget is increased
by10×, the size of the CLM model should increase by 4×
and the training data by 3×, aligning more closely with equally proportional scaling. For the MLM,
the model size should increase by 6×and the training data size by 1.7×.
In exploring the scaling relations of loss, we analyzed various model sizes N, compute budgets C,
and training dataset tokens D. These can be described by a similar power-law relation defined as:
L(x) =βx×xαx(2)
where αxis the scaling exponent for different variables. For each FLOP count, we aimed to identify
the minimal loss as the fitting target along with the corresponding independent variable x. Table 3
presents these fitting coefficients.
Based on the coefficients obtained from the fitting described above, we can establish the relationship
between DandNby eliminating L. The relationship is expressed by the following equation:
D(N) =βN

By substituting the learned coefficients into this formula, we can derive Dopt
MLM andDopt

N. The estimation may be affected when the data exceeds 200 billion or when the quality or quantity
of the training dataset changes.
53.2 Scaling law for training two models
When our goal is to optimize both CLM and MLM simultaneously, the strategic allocation of
compute resources between these two objectives becomes essential. To facilitate this, we equalize
model parameters across objectives to assess specific compute budgets for dual-objective training.
Specifically, we seek the compute budgets, CMLM andCCLM, for configurations where the optimal
model size is the same, i.e., N(CMLM) = N(CCLM). These individual computations are then
aggregated to formulate the overall compute budget:
Csum(N) =CMLM(N) +CCLM(N) = 
6.2×10−8
N!0.776
+ 
1.25×10−3
N!0.578
(4)
These two objectives share the same parameter size, their compute budget Cand the number of
training tokens Ddiffer. Thus we further introduce a model-to-ratio r(N)asDMLM(N)/D CLM(N).
We then achieve the relationship between NandCsumby a fitted power-law (Figure 3) form:
(
N(Csum)≈1.497×10−6×C0.703
sum
r(N)≈8.449×104×N−0.392(5)
The ratio r(N)informs us about the allocation proportion of training tokens. Specifically, under
equal parameters, the data for MLM should exceed that for CLM until a 10B threshold (achieving a
1:1) is reached, after which more training tokens are allocated to CLM.
We further find that the scaling behavior of sparse parameter counts in Mixture of Experts (MoE)
protein model [ 74], configured with eight experts (see Appendix I), as well as a combined power-law
formula used to fit our data (see Appendix J), both exhibit a similarity to the scaling behavior we
have proposed.
Findings 2. In both CLM and MLM, training data scales sublinearly with model size, following
distinct power laws. With an “infinite” dataset, where samples are not repeated and training for
less one epoch, MLM’s model size grows faster than CLM’s.
4 Transfer Scaling
We have outlined two independent scaling laws and how to allocate FLOPs under a fixed budget for
training two optimal models, one with MLM and the other with CLM. However, we have not explored
the interaction between these objectives. This raises important questions: Can models trained with
one objective transferred to one with another objective? Is there a synergistic effect from training two
models? Does training order impact the results?
4.1 Transferability
We conduct transfer learning experiments on MLM and CLM objectives, selecting eight optimal
model sizes based on Equation 1. These models correspond to four increasing FLOP counts from
3×1019to1×1021and undergo training from scratch followed by transfer training. Transfer training
involves initially training on MLM or CLM, then training on the alternate model for each size.
We find that optimal pre-training on one objective benefits the target objective in transfer learning,
though effects vary between methods. Starting with CLM and then training MLM, benefits increase
with model scale. In contrast, starting with MLM then training CLM sees diminishing benefits.
As shown in Figure 4 (left), for a model size of 230M with 3×1019FLOPs, CLM from MLM
pre-training reduces the loss by 0.02 compared to CLM from scratch, however, benefit that nears zero
for the 1.7B model. Conversely, for models from 85M to 1.2B, transfer benefits grow with model size,
the compared validation loss gap increasing from 0.025 to 0.045. This likely stems from the higher
loss utilization rate in CLM; CLM calculates losses for all tokens in a protein sequence, whereas
MLM only calculates losses for 15% of the tokens.‡.
‡Appendix C analyzes the mask ratios.
6MLM loss curve from scratchCLM loss curve from scratchFigure 4: Left: The upper graph compares validation loss of CLM trained from scratch with those
transferred from MLM, showing diminishing transfer benefits as model size increases. The lower
graph depicts increased benefits for MLM from pre-trained CLM with larger sizes, indicating scale-
dependent efficiency gains. Right: Shows loss curves for CLM and MLM across different FLOPs,
emphasizing the efficient frontiers (or Pareto Frontier) from various transfer strategies. It highlights
that the benefits of transferring from CLM to MLM grow with model size, reflecting a scale-dependent
synergy between training objectives.
We use a power-law to model the transfer scaling law, initially excluding the pre-training FLOPs. The
scaling behavior of transfer learning is modeled by:
L(Cs) =As×Cαs
s, L (Ct) =Bt×Cαt
t (6)
where L(Ct)andL(Cs)represent the loss for transfer learning and training from scratch.

forL(Ct)has shifted relative to L(Cs)(it can
be directly obtained from Table 3, repeated here
for convenience.), indicating an improvement.
The coefficients from both are shown in Table 4,
where we can infer that Ct∝Cαs
αts=C0.89
s,
suggesting that training MLM from scratch with 10 ×the compute requires approximately 7.7 ×the
compute compared to MLM from CLM pre-training. Another observation is that mixing training
objectives in a single batch tends to be detrimental. Detailed results and settings are in Appendix H.
The recommended transfer learning schedule involves pre-training CLM before MLM, as mixed
training and order swapping show no benefits. We speculate that this primarily occurs because our
MLM, which focuses solely on recovering corruption tokens, is not causal. If it predicted a middle
segment in a left-to-right manner, it could mutually adapt with the context to accelerate training [ 86].
Findings 3. Transferring from MLM to CLM results in diminishing returns. Conversely,
transferring from CLM models to MLM models remains effective as compute scales.
4.2 Effectively Transferred Tokens
Although we observe that MLM benefits from transfer learning from CLM, the pre-training compute
budget remains unaccounted for. We focus on two aspects: (1) the actual benefit CLM provides to
MLM and its predictability, and (2) performance differences between MLM trained from pre-trained

Effectively Transferred Tokens Dtas the additional data a model of the same size would need to
train from scratch on MLM to achieve the same loss as a model pre-trained on CLM. If the token
number in the pre-trained CLM model exceeds Dt, then the computations for CLM pre-training was
excessive. Knowing Dtin advance would guide the allocation of tokens for CLM pre-training.
We compare MLM-S and MLM-CLM models ranging from 33M to 1.2B with FLOP counts from
3×1019to1×1021. By calculating the token distance at the same loss level between these models,
we establish our fitting target Dt, collecting approximately 2800 sample points. Following similar
methods in scaling transfer works [ 35,90],Dtis defined by a simple multiplicative scaling formula:
Dt=k×1
Dδ
f×1
Nγ;k≈3.65×105, δ≈ −0.137, γ≈ −0.369 (7)
where Dfrepresents the tokens used for MLM-CLM, and Nis the number of parameters, with k,δ,
andγas fitting coefficients. For instance, a 10 ×increase in Dfwould roughly triple the model size
and double Dt. We validate these findings by evaluating the compute ratio of CLM pre-training under
four specified parameters and FLOPs, as shown in Figure 5 (left), finding that MLM-CLM generally
outperforms MLM-S. Specifically, Dt/(Dt+Df)ranges from 10% to 20% of the compute budget
for CLM pre-training. Figure 5 (right) schematically illustrates the learning curves of two 85M (3e19
FLOPs) models, with MLM-CLM achieving similar or better loss levels with equal or fewer tokens.
Findings 4. Training MLM from scratch with 10 ×the compute requires approximately 7.7 ×the
compute compared to MLM from CLM pre-training, implying that around 20% of the compute
budget should be allocated for CLM pre-training to get better MLM models transferred from
CLM pre-training.
5 Experimental Validation
Based on the scaling laws we observe, we estimate the model size and training tokens for current
leading models by analyzing their FLOPs. In our configuration, the PROGEN2-xlarge model, with
6.4B parameters, is estimated to require training with 7.2B parameters and 265B tokens. Similarly,
the ESM-2 model, with 3B parameters, should be trained with a model size of 10.7B parameters
and 260B tokens. Additionally, we employed two 470M models to test the transfer scaling strategy,

5.1 Protein Generation Comparison: 7.2B CLM vs. 6.4B PROGEN-xlarge
We first evaluate the perplexity on OOD data and then compare the protein generation capabilities
of the 7.2B CLM and PROGEN2-xlarge models. Each model generated 2,000 sequences for each
parameter combination of top- p{0.5,0.7,0.9,1.0}and temperature t{0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0}, totaling
40,000 sequences per model. Sequences with a perplexity greater than 10 and duplicates were
removed, leaving 8,263 and 8,466 sequences for the 7.2B CLM and PROGEN-xlarge, respectively.
We used four metrics to assess the quality of the models and the generated sequences (See Appendix F
for details).
OOD Dataset PPL Analysis We randomly sampled 5,000 sequences from UniProt released after
2023-01-01 and aligned them to our and PROGEN2’s training data (Uniref90 and BFD) using
HHblits [ 66] or Jackhmmer [ 29]. Sequences below a maximum identity cutoff were used to assess
the models’ PPL, as shown in Figure 6A. Our 7.2B CLM exhibited lower PPL on three subsets.
pLDDT scores from ESMFold Atomic structures of 8,263 and 8,466 generated sequences were
predicted using ESMFold, and compared based on pLDDT scores, displayed in Figure 6B. The 7.2B
model’s average pLDDT score was 78.69, higher than PROGEN2-xlarge’s 74.33.
Natural Sequences Comparisons with Foldseek Using Foldseek [ 81], we searched the PDB
database for sequences similar to those generated by our 7.2B CLM model, which showed better
mimicry of natural sequence properties with higher average TM-scores (0.655 vs 0.522) and SeqID
(0.194 vs 0.165), as shown in Figure 6C.
Diversity Analysis Generated sequences were clustered using MMseqs2 [ 72] with a 50% similarity
cutoff. The 7.2B CLM model resulted in higher diversity with 7,097 clusters compared to 4,818
clusters for PROGEN2-xlarge, detailed in Figure 6D.
5.2 Protein understanding tasks: 10.7B MLM vs. 3B ESM2
We evaluate different task types from the protein benchmark [ 14]: Contact prediction as binary
classification at the amino acid pair level; fold classification into 1195 classes at the sequence level;
and fluorescence as regression tasks. Following [ 14], we add a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head
to each pre-trained model and apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 37] (r=8, α=16) for fine-tuning
(see Appendix G for convergence details).
9Table 6: Tasks performance of MLM Model on the test dataset with LoRA fine-tuning.
Models Contact Pred. (P@L/5) Fold Class. (1195 class.) Fluor. (reg.)
ESM-2 (3B) 0.91 0.69 0.65
Our 10.7B 0.91 0.72 0.69
470M scratch 0.78 0.65 0.67
470M trans. 0.80 0.66 0.67
The results, shown in Table 6 and A7, demonstrate that our 10.7B model outperforms ESM-3B on 7
out of 8 tasks. This confirms the rationale behind the observed scaling law and addresses concerns
about the scope and rigor of our evaluation tasks. Additionally, the 470M model transferred from
CLM pre-training continues to perform effectively in this task, showing the efficacy of the observed
transfer scaling law.
6 Discussion and Limitations
Data Repeat Scaling Law. Our scaling law is derived within a single-epoch training setting. It
is well known that MLM exhibits higher sample efficiency than CLM due to its dynamic masking
strategies across multiple epochs. However, this advantage diminishes when training is restricted
to just one epoch. We present an empirical study comparing a 2.8B model trained on 1T tokens
(approximately five epochs) with a 10.7B model trained on 265B tokens (roughly 1.4 epochs). The
two models achieve similar performance in terms of OOD PPL (10.33 vs. 10.21) while utilizing
the same amount of FLOPs. This finding suggests that repeating multiple rounds of MLM training
has minimal impact on reducing loss. Notably, the smaller models are more user-friendly during
inference and fine-tuning. Therefore, we suggest an alternative approach that adjusts the optimal
training token count and model size within the data-repeat scaling law.
Multi-modality Scaling. The multi-modal auto-regressive work [ 33] suggests the existence of a
nearly universal scaling law across various modalities, including images, videos, math, code, and
languages. Our results appear in this trend as well, such as, the scaling laws for CLM exhibit
similarities to those in natural languages. The same situation may apply to other modalities of
biological data, such as RNA and DNA [60].
Various Pre-train Datasets and Strategies. Our datasets cover a substantial portion of the
protein universe, yet they might not be entirely representative. Combining BFD [ 8], Uniref [ 75],
MetaClust [ 44], and IMG/JGI [ 52] with 90% clustering results in at least 600 billion unique tokens.
However, variations in datasets could affect the power-law behavior. Future work could explore
applying our findings to different model architectures. There is ongoing research on scaling LLMs
for long sequences [ 7,15,16,18,39,48,87], and MSA augmentation could significantly improve
protein representation regarding contacts and structure. Investigating scaling laws in this context
could be a promising direction for future research.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we are the first to establish a practical pathway for researchers to develop faithful and
powerful protein language models optimized by both CLM and MLM objective in an end-to-end
manner. This includes everything from pre-training dataset construction, expanded metagenomic
databases such as ColabFoldDB, emphasizing the critical importance of data quality and quantity
for scaling language models, to optimal parameter and dataset allocation along with the potential
loss prediction, as well as knowledge transfer from other pre-training objectives. Our work holds
significant potential for the application of large language models across various scientific domains.

A Related Work
Protein Language Model Since the advent of AlphaFold2 [ 41], the masked language model (MLM)
has been integrated as a subtask within the Evoformer architecture. In this context, an assumption
is that large language models can be considered as a lossless compression method [ 21]. This was
followed by a series of language modeling efforts [ 31,10,32,28,27], which aimed to conduct
pre-training on single-sequence proteins using larger datasets and model scales. These efforts sought
to harness the scale of the models to learn complex co-evolutionary information, although detailed
investigations on how to optimally scale these models remain scarce. Our work primarily focuses on
these finer aspects, aiming to fill this gap in the research.
16Training objectives In natural language processing (NLP), masked language models (MLM) are
rarely adopted due to the self-explanatory nature of natural language, which inherently prompts the
meta-knowledge of tasks and generates task targets through CLM (Conditional Language Modeling)
training models. However, a unified language modeling objective for Protein Language Models has yet
to be fully consented. Those based on causal language modeling (CLM) have been primarily explored
for protein design. Benchmarks in protein design using MLM [ 84] have also shown promising results
for generation [ 62], exhibiting variable performance when compared to CLM [ 91,83]. Additionally,
the potential of the in-filling task objective remains largely unexplored [ 6,77,25]. Our research aims
to thoroughly discern the scaling behavior of the two most common optimization objectives in this
domain.
Scaling Laws To our knowledge, the concept of scaling laws of language model is first introduced
by OpenAI [ 42]. Subsequently, numerous variants and modifications [ 36] have been developed
around this theme. Recently, an array of new scaling laws has emerged. These include scaling laws
related to learning rates and batch sizes [ 9], data-constrained scaling laws [ 58], scaling laws for
downstream tasks and Transfer [ 90,35], as well as scaling laws within the Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework [ 17], and those concerning long sequences and positional encoding [ 49]. While these laws
are primarily derived using auto-regressive models in resource-rich domains, their application in the
biological data sector is less common. Our work seeks to address this gap. Furthermore, scaling laws
for Masked Language Models (MLM) are notably scarce. Given that MLMs are currently one of the
most effective training methods for biological data, our research on MLMs could also be extended to
other non-text domains.

Figure A7: Learning curve for UR50/S dataset repetition methods . Our 194B tokens
dataset (UniMeta200B) shown in blue, serves as the reference with an approximate single epoch
run. The bootstrapping method, depicted in orange, processes 200 billion tokens with replacement,
indicating a tendency towards zero unsampled tokens by the fifth epoch. The every-epoch shuffle
method, in green, ensures all tokens are used per epoch, forming a stair-step pattern in training loss.
Lastly, the global shuffle method, in red, loosely uses all tokens each epoch but ensures the strict
number of epoch passes for every token. The rightmost plot of gradient norms shows an uptick for
curves corresponding to overfitting, signifying a lack of further optimization, with steep or erratic
gradients indicated by the ascending gradient norms.
We employed three different methods to repeat training on the UR50/S dataset, all of which ultimately
led to overfitting. The reference for these experiments is shown by the blue curve in Figure A7, which
represents UniMeta’s loss for approximately one epoch.
Firstly, using bootstrapping, we processed 200 billion tokens from UR50/S with replacement. In each
epoch, 65% of the dataset was randomly selected, leading to a diminished proportion of unsampled
tokens by the fifth epoch, as depicted by the orange curve.
Secondly, we shuffled the unique data for each epoch to ensure that all UR50/S tokens were used per
epoch, resulting in a stair-step pattern [ 30] in the training loss, illustrated by the green curve. It has
simply memorized the dataset but isn’t improving at generalizing. Over-confident predictions of the
first batch of the next epoch lead to a big step update, and then the model is not adapted to the next
batches, resulting in no longer a decrease in loss.
17Lastly, we shuffled the entire training dataset less stringently, which did not strictly ensure that all
UR50/S tokens were used every epoch, but guaranteed that each token was used an equal number of
times over the entire training period. We term it global shuffle, this approach is shown by the red
curve.
From the gradient norm curve shown in Figure A7 (right), we observe an uptick in gradient norm
for the overfitting curves, indicating that the model is no longer optimizing effectively. In machine
learning, such an increase in gradient norm typically suggests that the model is encountering areas of
the parameter space where gradients are steeper or more erratic, often occurring when the model starts
to memorize the training data rather than generalize from it, approaching a saturated network [ 55].
This behavior can result from overly complex models, too many training epochs without sufficient
regularization, or training on non-representative data.

Figure A9: Abalation of different masking ratios . Two models (154M and 85M) are trained from
5% to 60% masking intervals, and evaluated on contact map and fold classification downstream tasks.
In the original BERT work [ 23], the absence of masked tokens in downstream tasks presented a
mismatch with the pre-training data distribution. The authors investigated various masking ratios and
concluded that a 15% masking rate was most beneficial for downstream tasks. This was implemented
alongside an 80-10-10 strategy: 80% of the tokens were replaced with a mask, 10% were randomly
substituted, and the remaining 10% were left unchanged.
However, given the significant differences between protein sequences and natural language processing
data, we employed two models, sized at 85M and 154M, to explore a range of masking ratios from
185% to 60% (see Figure A8). The best masking ratios for validation loss drop ranged from 10% to
20%; ratios too small (5%) or too large (greater than 25%) degraded the performance.
We further used pre-trained eight different models to perform full fine-tuning on downstream tasks
such as Contact Prediction and Fold Classification in Figure A9. Results from the test datasets
revealed that, similar to NLP, the optimal performance was achieved within a 10%-20% masking
range. Specifically, a 20% masking ratio slightly outperformed 15% in Contact Prediction, while the
15% ratio yielded the best results in Fold Prediction. Consequently, for our Masked Language Model
(MLM), we decided to adhere to the 15% masking ratio with the 80-10-10 strategy for training all
our models.

Figure A10: Contact Prediction on MLM and CLM models. Two 3B models (CLM and MLM)
were trained using identical computational resources, represented by the probing and LoRA fine-
tuning methods. On the right, performance of a 7.2B CLM model is compared with an 880M
MLM model under similar pre-training loss conditions. These models exhibit differing rates of
convergence, highlighting the impact of uni-directional and bi-directional model architectures on
learning dynamics.
We compared the effectiveness of CLM in the downstream task of contact prediction, using two
different setups (Figure A10). In the first setup, two 3B models were trained under identical
computational resources on 200 billion tokens, 3.4×1021FLOPs . Their performance was evaluated
through two training approaches: Probing (freezing the pre-trained model) and LoRA fine-tuning,
with an added MLP head for comparison.
In the second setup, we compared the effects of MLM and CLM under similar loss conditions. Here,
a 7.2B CLM model and an 880M MLM model were selected, both achieving a loss of 1.98 on our
validation set. Despite the MLM model having a simpler loss calculation, involving a 15% mask rather
than a one-by-one mask—which would result in a higher loss—the MLM significantly outperformed
the CLM. Importantly, the CLM model’s computational power was an order of magnitude greater
than the MLM model ( 1.68×1022vs1.0×1021FLOPs). This suggests that despite the lower
loss achievable by the CLM model compared to MLM with a one-by-one mask, the unidirectional
limitations of CLM do not translate into better downstream task performance.
E Pre-training Dataset Quality
Compared to Uniref90, ColabFoldDB offers a higher diversity and larger numbers of protein se-
quences, though with generally shorter sequence lengths, likely suggesting potentially lower data
quality. To evaluate the efficacy of our expanded dataset, ColabFoldDB, we initially trained two
85M models separately on Uniref90 and ColabFoldDB. Uniref90 in our dataset comprises two
subsets: Uniref50/S and the incremental dataset over Uniref50/S, termed Uniref90/50. Similarly,
ColabFoldDB consists of representative and member data. We controlled the sampling proportion to
ensure uniform sampling across both datasets, with results reported in Table A8. Both models were
then trained using identical configurations on a 50B scale.
19From the perspective of validation loss in pre-training, the higher loss on ColabFoldDB might
be attributed to its lower diversity and shorter sequence lengths compared to Uniref90. However,
the performance on downstream tasks, such as contact prediction and fold classification, shows
negligible differences between models trained solely on ColabFoldDB and those trained on Uniref90,
as illustrated in Figure E. This confirms that ColabFoldDB is an effective expansion of Uniref90 that
maintains sample efficiency.

F The Evaluation of Protein Generation.
We explain more details about Protein Generation Comparison as follows:
OOD Dataset PPL Analysis. PPL represents the probability of the test sequences in the model
distribution. The lower the PPL, the closer the distribution of the model and the test set is. In order to
test the generalization ability of the model on new data, we use different sequence identity (0.0, 0.3,
0.5) as thresholds to select the test set.
pLDDT Scores from ESMFold. Predicted Local Distance Difference Test is the confidence level of
ESMFold protein structure prediction. This metric is widely used in methods such as AlphaFold2,
ESMFold, and OpenFold. pLDDT filters are often used in protein design (such as RFDiffusion),
which can significantly improve the success rate of protein design;
Natural Sequences Comparisons with Foldseek. Foldseek takes protein structure as input and
searches for proteins with similar structure in the database. We use the experimentally-resolved
protein structure as the database (PDB database) to explore how the structure of the generated
sequences close to PDB (a higher TM-score indicates higher structural similarity). This method has
been used to evaluate other methods for protein sequence generation (ProGen2, ProtGPT2);
Diversity Analysis. We cluster the two sets of sequences (ProGen2-xlarge and CLM) according to
sequence similarity. Sequences with a identity higher than 50% will stay in one cluster. Since the
20number of input sequences is similar (8,466 vs 8,263), we can measure the diversity of the generated
sequences by comparing the number of clusters.
G Convergence Analysis of Downstream Fine-tuning Tasks
Observing the learning curves in Figure A12a, we can assess the effectiveness of different fine-
tuning scenarios. For the contact prediction task, the convergence speed under the LoRA setting is
very similar for both models. Our testing reveals closely matching results for ESM-2 models with
capacities of 650M, 3B, 15B, consistent with the findings reported by Ankh et al. [ 27]. This similarity
suggests possible saturation of the dataset under single-sequence pre-trained models. Additionally,
the convergence rates for tasks such as fold classification and fluorescence are generally faster than
those for ESM-2, indicating robust generalization following our data augmentation strategies.
Based on the two 470M models defined in our Table 5, despite using the same computational power,
we observe distinct outcomes (Figure A12b) in contact prediction and fold classification tasks. The
MLM model from CLM pre-training converges slightly faster than MLM from scratch. However, the
distinction is less pronounced in the two downstream regression tasks. This suggests that perplexity
is more sensitive to protein structure related tasks, i.e., contact prediction and fold classification, but
shows less sensitivity to regression tasks, particularly when assessed using the Spearman metric,
which is prone to variability.

H Mixed Objectives Training
We also employed an untied model to simultaneously optimize two objectives:
LCLM =CE(V σ(W1(encoder (x))), ynext),
21Figure A13: Mixed objective validation loss . Comparative validation loss curves for models trained
from scratch versus mixed training approaches. Each panel corresponds to different model sizes, as
indicated by the parameters. For each model, two training strategies were compared over an identical
number of elapsed tokens: training from scratch (blue) and mixed training with the other objective
(orange). Across all model sizes, training from scratch consistently achieves lower validation loss
compared to mixed training, suggesting that mixed training may not be as effective as dedicated
training for each individual objective.
and
LMLM =CE(V σ(W2(encoder (x))), ymask),
where Vrepresents the protein vocabulary embedding, and W1andW2are the parameters corre-
sponding to the CLM and MLM tasks, respectively. CEis the cross-entropy operator. The σis the
Tanh activation function.
We compared CLM and MLM under our scaling law of optimal model and data size distributions. One
approach involved training from scratch, while the other used mixed training. In the mixed training
approach, the actual number of training tokens was higher due to the additional FLOPs consumed by
another optimally trained objective, in other words. In other words, mixed training consumes the
FLOPs of two optimal allocations; we only extracted the loss curve of one target for comparison. We
extracted the loss curve of just one target for comparison with the from-scratch training. Our findings
indicate that mixed training of the two targets can lead to detrimental interference, an effect not
observable in smaller models, as depicted in Figure A13. As the model size increases to a hundred
million or billion parameters, the differences become more pronounced. The possible reason for
this situation is that mixed training has reduced the batch size for one of the objectives, making
optimization difficult. We did not further investigate the impact of increasing the batch size and only
observed based on the training tokens. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are
mutually detrimental. Therefore, if both objectives are to be optimized concurrently, a sequential
training strategy should be employed: first optimizing CLM, followed by MLM training. We consider
that CLM is more challenging to predict than MLM, which may allow the model to capture more
complex and implicit sequential features initially, thereby enhancing its ability to understand and
predict masked words in subsequent MLM training.

of their dense counterparts. This suggests that MoE models can achieve similar scaling behaviors
with potentially lower computational costs.
I MoE Scaling
We find that the scaling behaviors of sparse parameter counts in Mixture of Expert (MoE) models are
remarkably similar to those of dense model sizes, potentially allowing for a reduced compute budget
for modeling scaling behaviors due to less activated parameters per token.
In our experiments, we evaluate MoE models ranging from 10M to 500M sparse parameter counts,
using a model size of 17 with eight experts, following the settings outlined in Mixtral of experts [ 40],
including its load-balancing scheme. The figure below shows different IsoFLOPs curves. Notably,
the FLOPs here are calculated based on sparse parameters rather than actually activated ones. We use
the method described in the main text to select optimal loss points and fit these around the sample
points, enabling us to project the optimal model size and number of tokens for larger models (center
and right). We observe that the power-law coefficients for CLM and MLM are similar to those of
dense models, with MoE CLM vs. Dense CLM at approximately 0.57 vs. 0.58, and MoE MLM vs.
Dense MLM at 0.74 vs. 0.77.
Our study strictly focuses on models with eight experts, which may not be entirely rigorous. Clark
et al. [ 17] proposed a unified scaling law defining effective training parameters for MoE, aiming
to harmonize the scaling laws for Dense and MoE models. Investigation of biological data will be
considered as future work.
J Combined Power-law
We applied the fitting function proposed by Chinchilla [ 36], detailed in Equation 8, to model the
effects of various factors on model performance. It can provide a loss prediction where neither the
parameters or model size are not optimal allocation. This loss function simultaneously depends on
parameters NandD:
L(N, D ) =A
Nα+B
Dβ+E (8)
23where Edenotes the irreducible loss. Parameters A,B,α, and βare learned through the fitting
process. As N→ ∞ orD→ ∞ , the function degenerates to a form similar to Equation 2, which
indicates that it models the scenarios under perfect conditions of other variables.
Given that most of our training tokens are used for less than or equal to one epoch, and that the model
size is prone to underfitting at fixed FLOPs, the asymptotic behaviors L(N)atD→ ∞ andL(D)at
N→ ∞ are enough for determining the parameters in L(N, D ).
To enrich data points, we randomly added several FLOP counts into 25% of the model size and
trained these models for 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 epoch. And we adopt the Huber loss to fit these
coefficients:
min
a,b,e,α,βX
iHuber δ 
LSE(a−αlogNi, b−βlogDi, e−logLi)
, (9)
where LSE represents the log-sum-exp operator, and δ= 10−3. The terms Ni,Di, and Lide-
note the model size, dataset size, and loss of the i-th run, respectively. We fitted the MLM val-
idation loss from 110 samples and the CLM validation loss from 149 samples using grid search
withα∈ {0,0.5, . . . , 2},β∈ {0,0.5, . . . , 2},e∈ {− 1,−0.5, . . . , 1},a∈ {0,5, . . . , 25}, and
b∈ {0,5, . . . , 25}. The final initialized parameters of CLM and MLM both are [e, a, b, α, β ] =
[1,5,10,0.5,0.5]. We set the maximum number of iterations to 1000, and the two objectives were
essentially achieved after 360 iterations. The exponential powers of learned aandbyielded the
coefficients A,B, which were reported in Table A9.
Table A9: Coefficient of Equation 8
Objective A B α β
CLM 143.9 22036 .5 0 .367 0 .496
MLM 3.365 7 .569 0 .042 0 .099
Substituting all learned coefficients into the following Equation from the original Chinchilla paper:
Nopt(C) =GC
6a
, D opt(C) =G−1C
6b
where G =αA
βB 1
α+β
, a =β
α+β, b =α
α+β.(10)
The results closely approximate the trends given in Equations 1 and 2, confirming our overall findings.
K IsoLoss
In addition to using the seven different FLOPs counts reported in the main text to determine the
optimal model sizes and fit our scaling law, we also incorporated additional model points into our
analysis. We trained using the final loss points of all the CLM and MLM that are run. Figure A15
depicts the contour of the fitted function Land the efficient frontier as a red dashed line, presented
in log-log space. The frontier interval of Figure 2 is computed from this observation. From this
approach, it revealed the scaling exponents for model size to be 0.77 in MLM and 0.57 in CLM, very
similar to the IsoFLOPs profiling method in Section 3.1.
L Training Procedure
We conducted all experiments using Ampere A100 GPUs (80G) equipped with NVLink, utilizing the
GLM framework [ 88,26] developed based on DeepSpeed and Megatron. We have used a total of
around 1 million GPU hours. Our approach predominantly utilized data parallelism, avoiding model
parallelism and pipeline parallelism to simplify deployment. Modifications were made to the standard
Transformer architecture [ 82], adopting a DeepNorm [ 85] strategy and layer normalization [ 5]. The
activation function was set to GLU [ 71], RoPE [ 73] was used to encode position, similar to the
settings found in the Transformer++ architecture [ 79]. We further adopt FlashAttention [ 18] to

accelerate our training process. The used max LR empirically found to range between 6×10−4and
1.2×10−4from small to large model size, was used along with a cosine decay strategy to reduce it
to0.1×max LR . Both CLM and MLM were trained under similar settings for model size, with a
consistent LR and a minimum warm-up period of 2.5% steps, extending to at least 100K training steps.
All sequences were set to a length of 1024, with sequences concatenated using an <EOS> delimiter.
Based on findings related to loss magnitude and batch size [ 53]. The AdamW optimizer [ 50] was used
withβ1= 0.9,β2= 0.95, ϵ= 1×10−8, and a weight decay of 0.01. All experiments omitted the
dropout (it reduced the capacity to hinder model scaling) and trained with bfloat16. Most pre-training
experiments were confined to the ≤1epoch, with some models extending up to 30% beyond one
epoch. For the transfer learning setting, we load the finished checkpoint of the pre-training model and
disregard the pre-trained optimized state, and learn rest tokens with warmup 5% steps the max LR.
M Broader Impact
If the scaling law of the protein language model improves predictions or understanding of protein
structure and function, it could potentially have positive impacts on scientific research in fields such
as biology, medicine, and drug development. This may facilitate the development of new drugs,
accelerate progress in disease diagnosis, or drive advancements in frontier research in the life sciences.

26NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We clearly made statements to claim the contributions in the abstract and
introduction sections.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed several limitations of our work in Section 6.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
27Justification: This work is primarily focused on empirical experiments and extensive val-
idation rather than providing theoretical results. Therefore, the paper does not include a
set of assumptions or proofs for theoretical results since it is not the main emphasis of the
research.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details in the main text and Appendix to ensure
the reproduction of all the experimental results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
285.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details in the Appendix to ensure the re-
production of all the experimental results. Moreover, we release code and script at
https://github.com/cxysteven/ScalingProteinLM .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details in the Appendix L to ensure the
reproduction of all the experimental results. Moreover, we release code and script at
https://github.com/cxysteven/ScalingProteinLM .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have presented our results with the error bar in Figure 2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
29•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details in the Appendix L to ensure the
reproduction of all the experimental results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed and obeyed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the broader impact in Appendix M.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
30•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have mentioned all the source of used data, code, and models.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
31has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We release code and script at https://github.com/cxysteven/
ScalingProteinLM .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We don’t include human subjects or crowdsourcing in this work.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We don’t include human subjects or crowdsourcing in this work.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
32•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
33
