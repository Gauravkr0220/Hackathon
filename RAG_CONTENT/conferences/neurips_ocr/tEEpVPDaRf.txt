Abstract
Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating
personalized subjects based on a few reference images. However, current methods
often fail when generating multiple subjects simultaneously, resulting in mixed
identities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we
present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by
effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to
utilize segmented subjects generated by a foundation model for segmentation
(Segment Anything) for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation
for training and initialization for the generation process. Moreover, we further
introduce a new metric to better evaluate the performance of our method on multi-
subject personalization. Experimental results show that our MuDI can produce
high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar
subjects as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in human evaluation, MuDI obtains
twice the success rate for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing
over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% against the strongest baseline.

Figure 2: Comparison of multi-subject personalization methods using Corgi and Chow Chow
images (red boxes) using SDXL [ 36]. DreamBooth [ 42] produces mixed identity dogs, such as a
Corgi with Chow Chow ears1. Cut-Mix [ 15] often generates artifacts like unnatural vertical lines.
Additionally, using layout conditioning like region control [ 14] proves ineffective in preventing
identity blending in recent advanced diffusion models such as SDXL. In contrast, ours successfully
personalizes each dog, avoiding identity mixing and artifacts observed in prior methods.
1 Introduction
Text-to-image diffusion models, trained on large datasets of image and text pairs, have shown great
success in generating high-quality images for given text prompts [ 39,43,40,5]. Building on this
success, there is a growing interest in personalizing these text-to-image models. Specifically, given a
few images of a single user-defined subject, several methods have been developed to enable these
models to generate images of the subject in novel contexts [ 13,42,50,21]. Furthermore, these per-
sonalization methods have been expanded to include the customization of style [ 45], background [ 47],
and activity [19], offering even greater flexibility and creativity in image generation.
Despite significant progress in personalizing text-to-image models for single subjects, current methods
often struggle to handle multiple subjects simultaneously [ 21,15]. While successful in rendering each
subject individually, these methods suffer from identity mixing during the composition of subjects.
For instance, as shown in Figure 2(a), recent works, such as DreamBooth [ 42], generate images
with mixed identities when applied to two dogs. The problem of identity mixing becomes more
pronounced with semantically similar subjects that share attributes, such as colors or textures, which
leads to greater confusion in maintaining distinct identities.
To address identity mixing in multi-subject personalization, Han et al. [15] proposed to use Cut-
Mix [ 55], an augmentation technique that presents the models with cut-and-mixed images of the
subjects during personalization. However, using Cut-Mix-like images inevitably often results in the
generation of unnatural images with stitching artifacts, such as vertical lines that separate the subjects.
Moreover, Cut-mix remains unsuccessful in decoupling similar subjects (see Figure 2(b)). There
are alternative approaches [ 8,25,14] that rely on pre-defined conditioning, e.g., bounding boxes or
ControlNet [ 56] to separate the identities spatially. However, such auxiliary inputs like sketch [ 56]
could be difficult to obtain, and we have observed that the layout conditioning is ineffective for recent
diffusion models such as SDXL [36] (see Figure 2(c) and Appendix B.11).
In this work, we propose MuDI, a multi-subject personalization framework that effectively addresses
identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects. Our key idea is to leverage the segmented subjects
obtained by a foundation model for image segmentation (Segment Anything Model (SAM) [ 20]),
enabling the decoupling of the identities among different subjects. Specifically, we extract segmenta-
tion maps of the user-provided subjects using SAM and utilize them for both training and inference.
For training, we introduce a data augmentation method that randomly composes segmented subjects,
which allows efficient personalization by removing identity-irrelevant information. Additionally, we
utilize the segmented subjects to initialize the generation process. Instead of starting from Gaussian
noise, we begin with a mean-shifted random noise created from segmented subjects. We find that this
provides a helpful hint for the model to separate the identities and further reduces subject missing
during generation. Notably, our approach significantly mitigates identity mixing as shown in Figure 2,
without relying on preset auxiliary conditions such as bounding boxes or sketches.
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using a new dataset composed of subjects
prone to identity mixing, which includes a diverse range of categories from animals to objects and
scenes. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce a new metric specifically designed to assess the

2fidelity of multiple subjects in the images, taking into account the degree of identity mixing. In our
experiments, MuDI successfully personalizes the subjects without mixed identities, significantly
outperforming DreamBooth [ 42], Cut-Mix [ 15], and Textual Inversion [ 13], in both qualitative and
quantitative comparisons. Further human study with side-by-side comparisons of MuDI over other
methods shows that human raters prefer our method by more than 70% over the strongest baseline.

Text-to-image personalization Personalized text-to-image diffusion models have shown impressive
abilities to render a single user-specific subject in novel contexts from only a few images. Two
representative classes of personalization methods have been proposed by Gal et al. [13] and Ruiz et al.
[42]. Textual Inversion [ 13] optimizes new text embedding for representing the specified subjects
and has been improved for learning on extended embedding spaces [ 50,1]. On the other hand,
DreamBooth [42] fine-tunes the weights of the pre-trained model to bind new concepts with unique
identifiers and has been developed by recent works [ 21,15,48] for efficiently fine-tuning the models.
However, existing methods fall short of synthesizing multiple user-defined subjects together, suffering
from identity mixing. Han et al. [15] introduce Cut-Mix to address identity mixing by augmenting
Cut-Mix-like images during training but fail to separate similar subjects and generates stitching
artifacts. Other lines of work [ 25,14] compose personalized subjects using layout conditioning,
which manipulates cross-attention maps with user-defined locations. Yet such conditioning based
on cross-attention maps is ineffective for recent diffusion models such as SDXL [ 36]. In this work,
we develop a novel framework that allows the personalization of multiple subjects without identity
mixing even for subjects with similar appearances.
Modular customization Recent works [ 21,14,35] explore a different scenario for personalizing
multiple subjects, namely modular customization , where the subjects are independently learned
by models and users mix and match the subjects during inference to compose them. Custom
Diffusion [21] merges individually fine-tuned models by solving constrained optimization and Mix-
of-Show [ 14] introduces gradient fusion to merge single-concept LoRAs [ 18]. When handling
multiple subjects, these works also suffer from identity mixing, and they rely on preset spatial
conditions such as ControlNet [ 56] and region control [ 14] to address the problem. Notably, our
method can be applied to this scenario to decouple subjects’ identities without using such conditions.
3 Preliminaries
Text-to-image diffusion models Diffusion models [ 17,46] generate samples from noise by learning
to reverse the perturbation, i.e., denoise, which can be modeled by a diffusion process. To be specific,
at each step of the diffusion, the model predicts the random noise ϵ∼ N (0,I)that has been used
to corrupt the sample. Text-to-image diffusion models [ 43,40] incorporate text conditions for the
generation. Given the dataset Dconsisting of the image-text pairs (x,c), text-to-image diffusion
models parameterized by the noise prediction model ϵθcan be trained with the following objective:
LDM(θ;D) =E(x,c)∼D,ϵ∼N (0,I),t∼U(0,T)hϵθ(xt;c, t)−ϵ2

where ϵis the random noise, time tis sampled from the uniform distribution U(0, T), andxt=
αtx+σtϵfor the coefficients αtandσtthat determine the noise schedule of the diffusion process.
Personalizing text-to-image models Given a few images of a single specific subject, Dream-
Booth [ 42] fine-tunes the weights of the diffusion model with a unique identifier for the subject, i.e.,
"a [identifier] [class noun]". The model weights are updated to learn the subject while preserving the
visual prior, which can be achieved by minimizing the objective:
LDB(θ) =LDM(θ;Dref)|{z}
personalization loss+λLDM(θ;Dprior)|{z }
prior preservation loss, (2)
where LDMis the loss defined in Eq. (1),Drefis the dataset consisting of reference images of the
subject, Dprior is the dataset consisting of class-specific prior images, and λis a coefficient for the
prior preservation loss. Similar to personalizing a single subject, existing works [ 21,15] jointly train
for multiple subjects by combining the images from the set of user-specified subjects to construct
Drefand using different identifiers for each subject.

4 MuDI: Multi-subject personalization for decoupled identities
In this section, we present MuDI: Multi-subject personalization for Decoupled Identities, which
leverages segmented subjects to separate identities. In Section 4.1, we describe our training method,
which augments training data through random compositions of segmented subjects. We also introduce
a simple inference method that initializes noise for sample generation based on subject segmentation
in Section 4.2. Finally, we present a new metric to evaluate the multi-subject fidelity in Section 4.3.
4.1 Training
Personalization with augmentation To address identity mixing in multi-subject personalization,
we introduce a new data augmentation method for training the pre-trained text-to-image model
called Seg-Mix . We aim to mitigate identity mixing by leveraging segmented subjects during
personalizing text-to-image models. By isolating each subject from the background, Seg-Mix enables
the model to learn to distinguish between different identities effectively. We integrate Seg-Mix with
DreamBooth [42], which personalizes text-to-image models using unique identifiers (see Eq. (2)).
To implement Seg-Mix, we preprocess reference images by automatically extracting segmentation
maps of user-provided subjects using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [ 20]. Specifically, this
process begins with the extraction of subject bounding boxes using the OWLv2 [ 28], an object
detection model with an open vocabulary. Subsequently, SAM segments the subjects based on these
bounding boxes, as illustrated in Figure 3(a). After the preprocessing step, we create augmented
images by randomly positioning the resized segmented subjects, as illustrated in Figure 3(b). We
provide the detailed procedures of our method in Algorithm 1. These augmented images are paired
with a simple prompt "A photo of [ V1] and [ V2], simple background.", which is designed to explicitly
remove identity-irrelevant information. We also apply this augmentation to the prior dataset by
creating images from segmented prior subjects. Using augmented datasets, we fine-tune text-to-image
models based on the DreamBooth objective function in Eq.(2).
One of the key advantages of Seg-Mix is its ability to train models without identity-irrelevant artifacts,
due to the removal of backgrounds. This process also mitigates unnatural artifacts, such as stitching
artifacts observed in previous methods like Cut-Mix [ 15]. Moreover, by allowing subjects to overlap
during Seg-Mix, which is different from Cut-Mix, we prevent attributes from leaking to neighboring
identities and enhance interactions among the subjects, which we analyze in Appendix B.2.
Descriptive class Intuitively, for two similar subjects in the same category, separating them solely
with unique identifiers is a challenging task and prone to identity mixing. In single-subject per-
sonalization, Chae et al. [7]observed that adding detailed descriptions in front of the class nouns
helps in capturing the visual characteristics of rare subjects. Inspired by this observation, we adopt

specific class nouns (e.g., Weimaraner instead of dog) or add detailed descriptions in front of general
class nouns (e.g., white robot toy instead of toy). Instead of manually selecting appropriate classes,
we leverage GPT4-v [ 32] to automatically obtain these specific class nouns or descriptions. We
empirically validate that this simple modification improves the preservation of the details for multiple
subjects leading to the decoupling of the identities of highly similar subjects.
4.2 Inference
It has been observed that initial noises for the generation affect the overall quality of generated
images [ 27,44], a finding that holds for personalized models with Seg-Mix as well. Motivated
by this observation, we propose a novel inference method to improve identity decoupling without
additional training or computational overhead. As illustrated in Figure 3(c), we first create an image
xinitof segmented subjects following Seg-Mix and extract its latent embedding from V AE encoder
E. We then add this latent embedding to a random Gaussian noise ϵ, scaled by a coefficient γas
zT= (E(xinit)⊙Resize (Minit))∗γ+ϵwhere Resize (Minit)denotes the resized version of
segmentation mask Minit. This mean-shifted noisezTencodes coarse information about the subjects
and their layout, serving as a good starting point in sample generation. We analyze the effect of
coefficient γin Appendix B.3 and validate the diversity of generated images from the initialization in
Appendix B.4. The proposed inference method is summarized in Algorithm 2. Additionally, instead
of using randomly composed initial latent, we explore utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) [ 9]
to generate the layouts of bounding boxes for each subject aligned with the given prompt. Such an
LLM-guided initialization enhances the ability to render complex interactions between subjects (see
Figure 24 in Appendix B.5 for supporting results).
We remark that our initialization method also addresses the issue of subject dominance [ 49], where
certain subject dominates the generation while other subjects are ignored. By providing information
through the initial composition, our inference method guides the model to consider all subjects without
additional computation. In Section 5.3 and Appendix B.6, we validate that our inference method
alleviates subject dominance, playing a crucial role when rendering many subjects simultaneously.
4.3 New metric for multi-subject fidelity
Existing metrics designed for measuring subject fidelity, such as CLIP-I [ 37] or DINOv2 [ 33], are not
suitable for evaluating multiple subjects because they do not account for identity mixing. Therefore,
we introduce a new metric, called Detect-and-Compare (D&C), for evaluating multi-subject fidelity.
First, we utilize OWLv2 [ 28] to detect the subjects in the generated image, with text queries as
the supercategories of the subjects. For the detected subjects {Bi}N
i=1and the reference subjects
{Rj}M
j=1, we construct similarity matrices by measuring the similarities between the subjects using
subject fidelity metrics such as DreamSim [ 12] or DINOv2 [ 33]. Specifically, we first construct the
D&C similarities matrix SDC, where ij-th entry represents the similarity between detected subject
Biand reference Rj(see Figure 4). Similarly, we construct the ground-truth similarities SGT, where
ij-th entry represents the similarity between reference objects RiandRj. Since a mixed-identity
subject yields high similarities to multiple references, we compare SDCandSGTto account for
identity mixing. Notably, the difference between SDCandSGTyields a matrix where diagonal
entries denote similarities to the corresponding subject, while off-diagonal entries indicate similarities
to other subjects which represent identity mixing. The closer SDCis toSGT, the more accurately

the detected subjects resemble the references, resulting in successful identity decoupling. Therefore,
we define the D&C score as1− ∥SGT−SDC∥2
F. We illustrate an overview of D&C in Figure 4.
To validate that our D&C is capable of measuring multi-subject fidelity, we compare it with previous
single-subject fidelity metrics extended to multi-subject settings. These extended metrics compute the
mean similarity to all the reference images [ 24]. For 1600 images generated from various models, we
assess the correlation between each metric and human evaluations using Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient and the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) (see Appendix A.3
for details). Table in Figure 4 shows that D&C with DreamSim (D&C-DS) exhibits the highest
correlation with human evaluation. We provide qualitative examples in Figure 14 and Figure 18.
These demonstrate that D&C can capture multi-subject fidelity and is suitable as an evaluation metric.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental setup
Dataset We construct a new dataset to evaluate the performance of identity decoupling for multi-
subject personalization methods. It consists of 8 pairs of similar subjects that are prone to identity mix-
ing. We collected images from the DreamBench dataset [ 42] and the CustomConcept101 dataset [ 21],
consisting of diverse categories including animals, objects, and scenes. For each pair of subjects, we
generate 5 evaluation prompts using ChatGPT [ 30], which describe scenes involving the subjects
with simple actions and backgrounds. We provide more details of the dataset in Appendix A.2.

Figure 7: Ablation Studies on MuDI. While our method successfully personalizes Corgi and Chow
Chow, ablating Seg-Mix results in mixed identity dogs. Inference without our initialization generates
images of the subject missing. Training without descriptive class fails to catch subject details.
Implementation details For all experiments, we use Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) [ 36] as the
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and employ a LoRA [ 18] with a rank of 32 for U-Net [ 41]
module. We also present experiments with other Stable Diffusion models [ 40] in Appendix B.12
and B.13. For all methods, we pair the reference images with comprehensive captions obtained
through GPT-4v [ 32] which effectively mitigates overfitting to the background and shows better
text alignment. We evaluate 400 generated images for each method, across 8 combinations with 5
evaluation prompts and 10 images of fixed random seeds. We provide more details in Appendix A.1.
Baselines We evaluate our method against multi-subject personalization methods: DreamBooth [42],
DreamBooth with region control [ 14], DreamBooth using Cut-Mix [ 15] augmentation, namely Cut-
Mix, and Textual Inversion [13]. Note that we exclude Custom Diffusion [ 21] from the baselines due
to its low quality when applied to SDXL (see Appendix B.1). For both Cut-Mix and Seg-Mix, we use
a fixed augmentation probability of 0.3, and we do not use Unmix regularization [ 15] as it degrades
the image quality for SDXL (see Appendix B.10). We describe further details in Appendix A.1.
5.2 Main results
Qualitative comparison As shown in Figure 5, our approach successfully generates the subjects
avoiding identity mixing, even for similar subjects such as two dogs (2nd column). On the contrary,
DreamBooth results in mixed identities, and using region control proves ineffective for separating
identities, as it seldom succeeds and frequently fails. Cut-Mix also falls short of decoupling the
identities while producing stitching artifacts. Textual Inversion fails to preserve the subjects’ details.
Human evaluation We conduct human evaluations to assess the quality of images generated by the
baselines and our method. We first ask human raters to evaluate the multi-subject fidelity via binary
feedback. Additionally, we provide reference images of each subject along with two anonymized
images: one from MuDI and the other from Cut-Mix. Human raters are asked to indicate which one is
better, or tie based on three criteria: (1) similarity to the subjects in the reference images, (2) alignment
with the given text, and (3) overall image fidelity. We provide more details in Appendix A.4.

As shown in Figure 6 (Left), MuDI significantly outperforms prior works in multi-subject fidelity,
achieving twice the success rate in preventing identity mixing compared to Cut-Mix. Due to this,
raters strongly prefer images generated by MuDI in side-by-side evaluations. These results confirm
that MuDI effectively decouples the identities of highly similar subjects without stitching artifacts.
Quantitative results We evaluate multi-subject personalization methods on two key aspects:
multi-subject fidelity , which measures the preservation of subject details for multiple subjects, and
text fidelity , which assesses how well the generated images align with the given text prompt. We
use our D&C scores to evaluate multi-subject fidelity. For text fidelity, we report the results of
ImageReward [54] and CLIP score ( CLIPs ) [37]. To avoid position bias, we calculate scores for the
two different orders and average them, for example "[ V1] and [ V2]" and "[ V2] and [ V1]."
As shown in the Table of Figure 6 (Right), our framework achieves the highest scores in both multi-
subject and text fidelity, significantly outperforming previous methods. These results are consistent
with qualitative assessments and human evaluations, where MuDI preserves subject details effectively
without identity mixing, unlike prior methods. The superior text fidelity also indicates that our method
generates images that closely follow the given prompt without mixing the subjects.

Seg-Mix results in low multi-subject fidelity due to iden-
tity mixing. Figure 7 demonstrates that the attributes of
the Corgi and Chow Chow are completely mixed without
Seg-Mix. In particular, we show in Figure 26 that us-
ing additional spatial conditioning, e.g., ControlNet [ 56],
without Seg-Mix still suffers from identity mixing.

(Top row) DreamBooth produces mixed-identity teddy bears while MuDI generates distinct bears.
(Bottom row) MuDI can personalize many subjects without identity mixing on diverse backgrounds.
Importance of our initialization We show in Figure 7 that the inference initialization improves
identity separation and alleviates subject dominance. Table 1 validates that images generated without
initialization result in lower subject fidelity. We empirically find that our initialization provides
significant benefits in three scenarios: (1) personalizing unusual subjects that pre-trained models
struggle to generate (e.g., the cloud man of Figure 1 bottom-right), (2) personalizing more than two
subjects, and (3) using complex prompts, which we explain in detail in Appendix B.6.
Descriptive class We show in Figure 7 that using descriptive classes to represent the subjects
improves the preservation of the subjects’ detail, and Table 1 further shows that this method enhances
subject fidelity. Despite the improvement, relying only on descriptive classes may occasionally lead
to some subjects being ignored. This is effectively addressed by applying our initialization which
results in significantly improved outcomes.
More than two subjects Figure 8(b) shows the success rates of MuDI, DreamBooth [ 42], and
Cut-Mix [ 15] as the number of subjects varies. Our method achieves significantly high success rates,
while previous approaches [ 42,15] fail to personalize even two subjects effectively. In particular, our
method shows over 50% success for generating four objects together (see Figure 8(a)). However, we
observe that the performance of MuDI decreases as the number of personalized subjects increases,
particularly for highly similar subjects. We provide further details in Appendix B.9.
Diverse background As shown in Figure 9, our Seg-Mix does not have a bias with white back-
grounds and can generate diverse backgrounds. This is because the prompt “A photo of [ V1] and
[V2], simple background” is used during training for the image of segmented subjects composed on a
white background. This effectively disentangles the background from the identities through the text
“simple background”, preventing overfitting.
Model agnostic Notably, MuDI is a model-agnostic personalization method as it is based on
data augmentation during training that does not require model-specific techniques, such as utilizing
attention maps [ 3,53] or choosing where to fine-tune [ 21,48]. We validate this by using FLUX [ 22]
as the pre-trained text-to-image model based on DiT [ 34], which is different from SDXL [ 36] based
on UNet [ 41] backbone. As shown in Figure 10 top row, DreamBooth produces mixed identity teddy
bears while MuDI successfully generates distinct bears without identity mixing. We show in Figure 10
bottom row that MuDI can personalize multiple subjects using FLUX in diverse backgrounds.
5.4 Other use cases
Controlling relative size Our framework offers an intuitive way to control the relative size between
the personalized subjects. By resizing the segmented subjects according to user intents in Seg-Mix,

+ Seg -Mix“… walking together in Times Square.” “… boxing in the octagon, match day.”Figure 11: Examples of other use cases of our method. (a) Controlling relative size with Seg-Mix.
We visualize samples generated by MuDI using size-controlled Seg-Mix. (b) Modular customization.
Applying Seg-Mix after merging LoRAs significantly improves identity decoupling.
we find that personalized models generate subjects with the desired relative sizes. This showcases
another benefit of our method unlike previous methods [ 42,21,15], which often result in inconsistent
relative sizes due to a lack of size information during fine-tuning. As shown in Figure 11(a), our
method allows the model to be personalized to generate either a larger dog compared to the toy or
vice versa, by setting their relative sizes during Seg-Mix. The generated images show a consistent
relative size which we provide more examples in Figure 34. Additionally, controlling the relative size
of the segmented subjects during inference initialization can further improve the size consistency.
Modular customization The proposed Seg-Mix can also be applied to modular customization,
where the subjects are independently learned in advance by single-subject LoRAs [ 18]. We then
efficiently combine these LoRAs to generate multi-subject images. To integrate Seg-Mix with modular
customization, we first generate images for each subject using their respective single-subject LoRA,
which serve as reference images. Next, we merge the single-subject LoRAs using an existing method
such as gradient fusion [ 14]. After merging, we apply Seg-Mix with the generated single-subject
images for 200-300 iterations. This approach effectively reduces identity mixing and avoids the need
for training from scratch by reusing the single-subject LoRAs. We illustrate the process of using
Seg-Mix in Figure 35.
Figure 11(b) shows samples generated by gradient fusion [ 14], a modular customization method,
applied to two-subject personalization. Without spatial conditioning, it produces mixed identities
for the characters of the otter and the monster (left). However, if we fine-tune fused model with
Seg-Mix only for a few iterations, the fine-tuned model produces a high-quality image of clearly
separated subjects (Figure 11(b), right). We note that it is important to incorporate Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence as regularization [11] in fine-tuning in order to prevent saturation and overfitting.
5.5 Iterative training
To further improve the quality, we investigate a fully automatic iterative training (IT) method [ 45],
which fine-tunes the personalized model using high-quality samples obtained from an earlier training
stage. Specifically, we first generate multi-subject images with MuDI and select high-quality images
based on the D&C score, which closely aligns with the human evaluation. These selected images
are then used to fine-tune the personalized model, with KL regularization [ 11] added to Eq. (2). By
applying IT to the images of Corgi and Chow Chow, the D&C-DS score is improved from 0.613 to
0.672, achieving a higher success rate (see Figure 37). We provide further details in Appendix C.3.
6 Conclusions
In this work, we present MuDI, a novel personalizing framework for multiple subjects that addresses
identity mixing. We leverage segmented subjects automatically obtained from the foundation model
for image segmentation for both training and inference, through data augmentation for training
pre-trained models and initializing the generation process. We experimentally validate our approach
on a new dataset comprising combinations of subjects prone to identity mixing, for which ours
successfully prevents mixing even for highly similar subjects. We describe the limitations and societal
impacts of our work in Appendix D. We hope that our work can serve as a starting point to develop
personalizing methods for multiple concepts in more challenging scenarios.

14Appendix
Organization The Appendix is organized as follows: In Section A, we describe the details of the
experiments and our framework. We provide additional experimental results in Section B, and further
discussion on other use cases of MuDI in Section C. Lastly, in Section D, we discuss the limitations
and societal impacts of our work.
A Experimental details
A.1 Implementation details
Training details In our experiment, we use Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) [ 36] as the pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model. We employ LoRA [18] with a rank of 32 for the U-Net [41] module,
instead of training the full model weights. We do not train the text encoder.
For all methods, we pair the reference images with comprehensive captions obtained through GPT-
4v [32], instead of using a simple prompt like "A photo of a [V]". This effectively mitigates overfitting
to the background and shows better text alignment for the baselines and our method.
We construct the prior dataset Drefin Eq. (2)by generating from the pre-trained text-to-image
models using a prompt "A photo of <class>, simple background, full body shot." . Since the generated
prior images may contain more than one subject, we select images that contain a single subject.
We determine the training iterations of Seg-Mix on each combination in the dataset based on
the difficulty of personalizing the subjects individually using DreamBooth [ 42]. For example,
combinations including highly detailed subjects, such as "can" in Figure 5, require from 1400 to 1600
training iterations, while combinations containing subjects easy to learn, e.g., "dog," require about
1200 iterations. We use a fixed augmentation probability of 0.3 for both Cut-Mix and our Seg-Mix
with the same number of training iterations for a fair comparison. To prevent subject overfitting, we
use 1000 training iterations for DreamBooth.

return img
w/Negative w/o Negative
Figure 12: Cut-Mix with and without negative prompt . We observe that using the negative prompt
"A dog and a dog" leads to reduced artifacts but results in over-saturation as shown in the first row.
MuDI training details We provide a pseudocode of our MuDI training in Algorithm 1. For Seg-
Mix, we randomly rescale the segmented subjects and randomly choose the location of the subjects to
create random compositions of the segmented subjects. Note that the margin from the boundaries of
the image is also set as random, where larger margins allow for the possibility of subjects overlapping.
In particular, when creating the prior dataset Dreffor training, we use a descriptive class (Section 4.1)
to serve as the prior class. We automatically create segmentation masks for the images in the prior
dataset using OWLv2 [ 28] and SAM [ 20], similar to segmenting the reference images described in
Section 4.1. We illustrate the segmentation of the prior dataset in Figure 3 (denoted as Priors). Note
that we select images that contain a single subject and also result in a single segmentation mask. We
generated 50 images for the prior dataset.
After the preprocessing step, the training of MuDI takes almost the same duration as DreamBooth [ 42],
taking about 90 minutes to personalize two subjects on a single RTX 3090 GPU. We use AdamW
optimizer [ 26] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.999, weight decay of 0.0001 , and a learning rate of 1e-4,
following the setting of DreamBooth [42], and set the batch size to 2.

Figure 13: Dataset. We introduce a new dataset comprising eight combinations of similar subjects.
For each combination, we visualize one image per subject (red boxes) and three images generated by
DreamBooth. The score below the subjects denotes the DreamSim [ 12] similarity score between 0
and 1, where a larger value indicates higher similarity. The bottom-most two combinations have the
highest similarity which makes them challenging to personalize without mixing the identities.
MuDI inference details We provide a pseudocode of our inference initialization in Algorithm 2.
We first create images of randomly composed segmented subjects using the reference images and the
extracted segmentation masks. The composition can be either random, manually set, or obtained by
using LLM as described in Section 4.2. The images are then encoded into a latent with the V AE of
the SDXL [ 36], which is scaled by a factor of γ. The scaled latent is perturbed by the forward noising
process from time 0 to T, which results in the initial latent for the inference process. We control the
magnitude of the γscale and the relative size between the segmented subjects to address identity
mixing as well as subject dominance.
Inference using negative prompt While Han et al. [15] propose using negative prompts to reduce
stitching artifacts, we observe that this produces over-saturated samples. As shown in the top
row of Figure 12, using negative prompts results in low-quality images. Therefore, we opt not
to use negative prompts in the evaluation of Cut-Mix [ 15]. For our framework, we use a simple
negative prompt "sticker, collage." that alleviates sticker-like artifacts caused by over-training with
the segment-and-mixed images.
A.2 Dataset
We introduce a new dataset to facilitate evaluation for multi-subject personalization, comprising 8
combinations of similar subjects prone to identity mixing. We collected images from the datasets
widely used, namely the DreamBench dataset [ 42] and the CustomConcept101 dataset [ 21]. We
construct the dataset to comprise diverse categories including animals, objects, and scenes. We
visualize the subjects and the identity-mixed samples from DreamBooth in Figure 13.

A.3 Detect-and-Compare
We summarize the process of measuring the D&C score in Algorithm 3.
Correlation with human evaluation In the table of Figure 4, we assess the correlation between
human evaluation and the metrics (D&C scores and DreamSim scores). We generate a total of 1600
images, 400 images from Textual Inversion [ 13], DreamBooth [ 42], Cut-Mix [ 15], and our MuDI,
respectively, and ask human raters to evaluate the multi-subject fidelity via binary feedback. We
then measure the correlation between human evaluation results and the scores using Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC). Note that
the Spearman’s rank correlation was computed using the normalized sum of all human evaluation
answers (e.g., if 3 out of 5 raters answered "good," the score is 0.6). The AUROC was computed
based on the majority voting results (0 or 1).
Examples In the top row of Figure 14, we categorize the generated images from DreamBooth [ 42],
Cut-Mix [ 15], and MuDI into four cases, and provide the D&C matrix, D&C score, and DreamSim
score for each image. For successful images, the difference between SGTandSDCis significantly
small and results in high D&C scores. In cases where the identities are severely mixed or show two

identical subjects, the difference becomes considerably larger, and the D&C scores decrease. For
example, the fourth generated image features two monster toys, where one is blue and the other is
red. The blue monster toy resembles both the reference monster toy and the robot toy, leading to a
significant difference in the second row of SGTandSDC. However, DreamSim [ 12] extended to
multi-subject settings, which compute the mean similarity to all the reference images [ 24], fails to
distinguish between these cases effectively.
We also provide an example of D&C matrices and scores for three subjects in the bottom row of
Figure 14. Our D&C can be easily applied to evaluate identity mixing for many subjects.
Qualitative comparison of D&C and DreamSim Additionally, we analyze the alignment of D&C
to the human evaluation by comparing with DreamSim in Figure 18. We sort 24 images generated by
MuDI based on the D&C-DS scores and DreamSim scores, respectively, and compare the ranking
with the human evaluation. D&C perfectly aligns with the human evaluation, giving lower scores to
failed images with mixed identities. However, the single-subject metric DreamSim fails to align with
human evaluation, giving high scores to images with mixed identities or the wrong number of subjects.
This indicates that single-subject metrics are ill-suited to be used for evaluating multi-subject fidelity.
The qualitative comparison agrees with the quantitative analysis in Figure 4, where we show that
D&C achieves a high correlation with the human evaluation of multi-subject fidelity.

Evaluation prompts To evaluate the personalization methods, we generate 5 evaluation prompts
for each combination in the dataset using ChatGPT [ 30]. Each prompt describes a scene of the
subjects with simple action such as "... in a classroom with colorful chairs," or"... walking in a
bustling city street corner." . We avoid using complex prompts as models fail to generate images that
align with such prompts, regardless of the identity mixing. We note that the evaluation prompts were
unseen during training. Details of our evaluation prompts for each concept are in Figure 17.
Quantitative evaluation For evaluating the text fidelity, we made fair comparisons by using
descriptive classes for both evaluation and text prompts. To avoid positional bias from the order of
subjects in the prompts, we measured the scores for all possible orders of the subjects, for example,
"monster toy and can" and "can and monster toy", and reported the average of the scores. In the case
of ImageReward [54], the score differences between the different subject orders were not small.
Human evaluation Our human evaluation was conducted in two main aspects: (1) multi-subject
fidelity and (2) overall preference. For multi-subject fidelity, a random subset containing an equal
number of instances from each method was created and provided to human raters for binary feedback.
For overall preference, images from both Cut-Mix and ours were provided in random order, with
all images generated from the same seed. We provide reference images of each subject along with
two anonymized images, i.e., one from MuDI and the other from Cut-Mix We ask human raters to
evaluate which image they prefer based on three criteria: (1) similarity to the subjects in the reference
images, (2) alignment with the given text, and (3) image fidelity. If both images fail to depict the
subjects in the reference images, raters are instructed to select "cannot determine". We provide
screenshots of questionnaires and labeling instructions in Figure 15 and Figure 16, respectively.
A.5 Additional generated examples
We provide additional non-curated generated examples in Figure 19.

by MuDI based on (a) D&C-DS and (b) DreamSim. The highest-scored image is placed at the top left,
with scores decreasing progressively towards the bottom right. Note that for DreamSim similarity,
we take the average of the similarities to all the reference images. The yellow boxes indicate failed
images evaluated by human raters, for instance, mixed identity dogs or a dog is missing. We observe
that D&C score perfectly aligns with the human evaluation, yielding the failed images lower scores
than the successful images. On the other hand, DreamSim does not align with human evaluation
where the failed images are ranked high.

B Additional experimental results
B.1 Comparison with Custom Diffusion
Here, we provide the results of Custom Diffusion [ 21] that uses SDXL [ 36] as the pre-trained text-
to-image diffusion model. Due to GPU constraints, we fine-tune the weights of LoRA [ 18] instead
of directly fine-tuning the model weights. We evaluate two different models, one that uses a high
rank (i.e., rank 128) and the other that uses the same rank as ours (i.e., rank 32). However, we do not
observe significant differences between them.
As shown in Figure 20, Custom Diffusion demonstrates degradation in the subject fidelity compared
to DreamBooth [ 42]. The quantitative results in Table 2 similarly show that Custom Diffusion results
in lower multi-subject fidelity as well as lower text fidelity compared to DreamBooth and MuDI. Due
to the degradation, we exclude Custom Diffusion from our baseline in the main experiments.
B.2 Importance of subject overlap in Seg-Mix
As described in Section 4.1, our data augmentation method, Seg-Mix, allows subjects to be overlapped
when randomly positioning the segmented subjects (see Figure 3 upper right). This differs from
Cut-Mix [ 15] which is restricted to augmenting images of non-overlapped subjects. Here, we verify
that training the text-to-image models with images of overlapped subjects is crucial for generating
interaction between the subjects. In Figure 21, we qualitatively compare our MuDI with its variant
that is trained with Seg-Mix which does not allow subject overlap during data augmentation, namely
23Figure 21: Ablation study on Subject Overlap for our Seg-Mix . We compare MuDI against its
variant trained with Seg-Mix which does not allow subject overlap during data augmentation, i.e.,
Seg-Mix w/o subject overlap. MuDI successfully personalizes the subjects with natural interaction.
However, Seg-Mix without subject overlap results in identity mixing and subject ignorance.

γ.A larger scale γresults in more information preserved from the initial latent. (b)x0-prediction
through inference steps. The image except for the fine details is determined in the first 10 steps.
Thus providing information from the start via inference initialization plays a critical role in generating
successful multi-subject composition.
Seg-Mix w/o subject overlap . Our MuDI successfully personalizes the subjects distinctly with natural
close-distance interaction, for example, two dogs playing in the pool. In contrast, Seg-Mix w/o
subject overlap produces mixed identities for neighboring subjects (e.g., monster toy in the can) or
subject ignorance (e.g., generating only the Chow Chow while ignoring the Corgi).
B.3 Analysis on γ-scaling for inference initialization
Here, we analyze the effect of γ-scaling for our initialization by varying the magnitude of γfor
generating samples. As demonstrated in Figure 22(a), without inference initialization (i.e., γ= 0) it
results in an image independent of the initial latent, while the larger scale of γyields images with
layouts of subjects similar to the initial latent. Empirically, we observe that γexceeding 4 produces a
highly saturated image with the same posture and layout as the initial latent.
In particular, we validate the reason for the effectiveness of our initialization by investigating the
predicted clean image (i.e., x0) through the inference steps. As shown in Figure 22(b), we observe
that the overall image except for the fine details is determined within the first 10 steps of the inference.
Therefore, our initialization is critical in generating successful multi-subject composition by providing
information at the start. Using a larger scale γyields more information that strongly affects the final
image but also fixes the fine details such as postures and layouts.
24Figure 23: Diversity of images generated by MuDI . MuDI can generate images of personalized
subjects in diverse postures not restricted to the initial latent of our inference initialization. Each
visualized initial latent arranged in a 3 ×3 grid corresponds to the generated image of the same
position in the 3 ×3 grid. All the images are generated from the same random seed using the prompt

LLM-guided initialization. Instead of randomly positioning the segmented subjects, we utilize
LLM to automatically generate prompt-aligned layouts for the inference initialization. We find that
LLM-guided initialization enables the generation of complex interactions between subjects.
B.4 Diversity of images generated by MuDI
In Figure 23, we demonstrate that MuDI is able to generate images of personalized subjects in diverse
postures not restricted by the initial latent of our inference initialization. In particular, the generated
subjects integrate smoothly with the background and exhibit natural interactions between the subjects.
B.5 LLM-guided initialization for interactions
Generating complex interactions involving relations like "[ V1] toy sitting on [ V2] can" can be
challenging for personalized subjects. However, our initialization method can significantly assist this
by providing a well-aligned layout reflecting the prompt, such as placing the toy above the can.
25Figure 25: We describe three scenarios where our inference initialization provides significant advan-
tages. For each scenario, we visualize images generated with and without initialization on the left
and the right columns respectively, where the image pairs (left and right) are generated using the
same random seed. (a) personalizing unusual subjects that pre-trained models struggle to generate,
such as cloud man. (b) personalizing more than two subjects , in particular for similar subjects. (c)
using complex prompts like"... as astronaut, floating on the moon, crater, space shuttle..." .
Figure 26: Even with the strong spatial conditioning of ControlNet [ 56], existing methods [ 42,15]
suffer from identity mixing. The generated images show a monster toy with the robot-like body or a
robot toy with the color of the monster toy.
Inspired by Cho et al. [9], we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate prompt-aligned
layouts of the segmented subjects. The generated layouts are used instead of randomly created
layouts for the inference initialization. Such LLM-guided initialization enhances the ability to render
complex interactions between subjects which we visualize in Figure 24.
B.6 Importance of inference initialization
We explain in detail the scenarios where our inference initialization provides significant benefits.
First, as shown in Figure 25(a), unusual subjects that pre-trained models struggle to generate (e.g., the
cloud man) are frequently ignored during generation without initialization. However, our initialization
alleviates the ignorance of unusual subjects by guiding the model to consider all subjects starting from
the initial latent. Furthermore, initialization is crucial when personalizing more than two subjects as
demonstrated in Figure 25(b). Generating images of more than two subjects without initialization
often results in some subjects missing. It is almost impossible to compose many subjects together in
an image without initialization. Lastly, we observe that initialization plays an important role when
the given prompt is complex as shown in Figure 25(c). Personalized diffusion models fail to generate
images of the subjects when the prompt describes uncommon or highly detailed scenes, resulting
in subjects of mixed identities or some subjects missing. The inference initialization mitigates this
problem by providing information on the subjects through the initial latent for which the model can
focus more on rendering the scene described by the prompts. Our approach allows us to create images
of personalized subjects, in particular new characters, in novel scenes.
26Figure 27: Inference initialization for pre-trained text-to-image models. (a) For the unseen
subjects, using initialization without personalization fails to preserve the details of the subjects, even
initializing with a high gamma value (i.e., γ= 4).(b)For the known subjects, where the images are
generated by the model, initialization still results in identity mixing.

B.7 Multiple subject composition with ControlNet
We validate that leveraging ControlNet [ 56] for previous approaches, for example, DreamBooth [ 42]
and Cut-Mix [ 15], fails to address identity mixing. Figure 26 demonstrates that DreamBooth and Cut-
Mix produce mixed identity toys even with the spatial conditioning of ControlNet. We note that other
types of layout conditioning based on cross-attention maps, for instance, the region control [ 14], do
not alleviate identity mixing when using SDXL as the pre-trained model, as explained in Section B.10.
B.8 Inference initialization for pre-trained text-to-image model
In Figure 27, we provide examples of inference initialization applied to the pre-trained text-to-image
model. When the initial latents are created from subjects that were not seen by the pre-trained model
(monster toy and robot toy in Figure 27(a)), the model fails to generate the details of the subjects.
Only the layouts are preserved when using a high γscale for the initialization. When the initial latent
is created from known subjects (Corgi and Chow Chow in Figure 27(b)), the model results in identity
mixing, even with a high gamma scale. Therefore, we can observe that our inference initialization
can only be effectively used to address identity mixing when the model is fine-tuned by our Seg-Mix.
B.9 More than two subjects
Qualitative comparison In Figure 28, we provide a qualitative comparison of previous ap-
proaches [ 42,15] and our MuDI on personalizing three subjects. As DreamBooth [ 42] suffers
from identity mixing even for two subjects, it fails to generate a composition of the three personalized
subjects. Cut-Mix [ 15] also produces mixed-identity dogs and often generates images of some
subjects missing. In contrast, MuDI can successfully generate high-quality images of the dogs and
the cat that align with the given prompts.
Number of personalized subjects We analyze the performance of MuDI with respect to the
number of subjects in Figure 29. We used two types of datasets composed of five subjects where the
first category consists of five objects (monster toy, drink can, robot toy, Harry Potter toy, and teddy
bear), while the second category consists of five animals (four types of dogs and one type of cat).
After fine-tuning the pre-trained text-to-image model for each category, we generated 600 images
composing Nsubjects for N∈ {2,3,4,5}. The images were generated using the prompts "[ V1],
[V2], ... [ VN] are in the jungle," for the objects and "[ V1], [V2], ... [ VN] are playing together in the
pool," for the animals. We consider all combinations and permutations of the subjects’ order in the
prompts uniformly. In particular, we observe that adding " Nobjects: " or "Nanimals: " at the start of
the prompt achieves a higher success rate. We use a γscale of 2 for cases with two or three subjects,
27Figure 28: Qualitative comparison of personalizing three subjects. DreamBooth [ 42] suffers from
severe identity mixing, especially for the two dogs. Cut-Mix [ 15] also fails to generate three subjects
often ignoring some subjects and producing stitching artifacts. In contrast, MuDI successfully
generates three personalized subjects without identity mixing that align with the given prompts.

“... playing in the lavender field, rushing.”ReferencesDreamBooth Cut-Mix MuDI  (Ours)

to number of subjects. MuDI shows a higher success rate compared to the baseline, DreamBooth.
(b) Qualitative samples. MuDI generates images with 4 and 5 subjects without identity mixing.
and a γscale of 3 for cases with more than three subjects. The success rate was measured by first
filtering the images using the D&C scores and then evaluating the success by humans.
We report the success rate of the generated images with respect to the number of subjects in Fig-
ure 29(a). DreamBooth completely fails to personalize more than two subjects for both categories. In
contrast, MuDI achieves a significantly high success rate with the objects (Category I), showing over
50% success for generating four subjects together without identity mixing. While MuDI shows a
relatively lower success rate with the animals (Category II) due to the high similarities of the subjects,
MuDI can generate high-quality images of five animals with lively actions that align perfectly with
the background. We visualize the successful images generated by MuDI in Figure 29(b). However,
we observe that the performance of MuDI decreases as the number of personalized subjects increases,
particularly for highly similar subjects.
Empirical findings We end this section by providing empirical findings for personalizing multiple
subjects. First, during training, we find it to be sufficient to augment images by composing only pairs
of subjects, rather than composing three or more subjects together. Furthermore, when personalizing
more than three subjects, a higher augmentation probability is required during training compared
to the case with two subjects. Also, a higher γvalue is needed during inference to generate all the

detailed background or challenging actions may likely yield unsuccessful images. Notably, adding
detailed descriptions like " Nobjects: " at the start of the prompt results in a higher success rate.
B.10 Analysis on cross-attention maps of SDXL
Cross-attention maps have been widely used in prior works on image editing [ 16], layout-guided
generation [ 25,14], single-subject personalization [ 52,3], and zero-shot multi-subject personaliza-
tion [ 53] due to their controllability on the relation between the spatial layouts and the words in the
prompt [ 16]. While the cross-attention maps worked successfully on previous diffusion models like
Stable Diffusion (SD) [ 40], it is not the case for recent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion
XL (SDXL) [ 36]. The architectural design of SDXL, where an additional text condition is added to
the time embedding [ 4], significantly reduces the consistency of the cross-attention maps which we
demonstrate in Figure 30. Therefore, previous approaches based on the cross-attention maps [ 25,14]
are not directly applicable when using SDXL as a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. For
example, Han et al. [15] propose Unmix regularization, a technique that utilizes cross-attention maps
to reduce stitching artifacts of the generated images, which we observe it to be ineffective for SDXL.
B.11 Regionally controllable sampling for SDXL
To address identity mixing, Gu et al. [14] propose regionally controllable sampling, i.e., region
control, which leverages multiple regional prompts and the corresponding cross-attention maps
during inference. However, manipulating the cross-attention map is not effective in preventing

identity mixing for recent diffusion models like SDXL [ 36]. We empirically observe that region
control is highly likely to produce images with some subjects missing or having mixed identities, as
demonstrated in Figure 31(a).
On the other hand, our MuDI can prevent both subject missing or identity mixing without using
cross-attention maps, even in cases involving highly similar subjects or overlapping layouts. Notably,
our initialization does not require additional computational overhead, in contrast to regional control
which requires 1.6 times the inference time due to the high number of cross-attention blocks.
B.12 Comparison with existing works using layout conditioning
We compare our MuDI with existing works on multi-subject composition using layout condition-
ing [ 14,25]. We use Stable Diffusion v2 [ 40] as the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. We
create the layouts required for the baselines, Cones2 [ 25] and Mix-of-Show [ 14], from the random
initial latent of our inference initialization. For a fair comparison, we did not use any image-based

Similar to the case of using SDXL [ 36] as a pre-trained model, DreamBooth [ 42] produces images of
mixed-identity toys. Our Seg-Mix effectively addresses identity mixing but often generates images
with the robot toy missing. In contrast, our MuDI, which leverages both Seg-Mix and our inference
initialization, successfully personalizes the subjects distinctly without identity mixing. Note that the
images of the same positions in the 3 ×3 grid are generated using the same random seed.
conditioning such as ControlNet [ 56] and T2I-adapter [ 29] for Mix-of-Show. We additionally re-
port the results of Mix-of-Show using Canny edge ControlNet, namely Mix-of-Show ∗. Note that
Mix-of-Show demonstrates significant performance degradation when the size of the bounding boxes
consisting of the layouts is not sufficiently large. Therefore, we manually set the bounding boxes in
the layout to be sufficiently large, for example, as the leftmost layout in Figure 31.
As shown in Table 3, MuDI achieves the highest D&C-DS scores as well as the ImageReward.
Cones2 demonstrates low subject fidelity on unseen subjects, for example, the monster toy, as it is
trained solely on text embeddings. Mix-of-Show frequently generates images with some subjects
missing, and results in low D&C scores. When used with ControlNet, Mix-of-Show generally shows
higher subject fidelity but often produces blurry backgrounds or images that are not aligned with
the given prompts. We also report the relative inference time compared to the normal inference
time using a pre-trained model for generating images with two subjects, as shown in Table 3. We
use the official codes available for each method and measure the inference time using a single RTX
3090 GPU. MuDI achieves significantly faster inference speed compared to the methods based on
cross-attention maps, namely Cones2 and Mix-of-Show.
Additionally, we provide a qualitative comparison in Figure 32. Custom diffusion [ 21] results in
identity mixing for similar subjects, while Cones2 produces significantly low subject fidelity for
unseen subjects such as the monster toy. Mix-of-Show generates images with some subjects missing
In contrast, our MuDI successfully generates multi-subject images without identity mixing.
B.13 Stable Diffusion v1.5 as a pre-trained model
In Figure 33, we provide qualitative results of DreamBooth [ 42] and MuDI using Stable Diffusion
v1.5 [ 40] as the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Similar to the case when using SDXL [ 36]
as the pre-trained model, DreamBooth results in identity mixing. Our Seg-Mix effectively addresses
identity mixing but often generates images of a subject missing. In contrast, our MuDI which
leverages both Seg-Mix and inference initialization successfully personalizes the subjects without
identity mixing or subject ignorance.
C Other use cases
C.1 Relative size control
MuDI enables control of relative size between the personalized subjects. During training, we can
augment the images of segmented subjects with fixed relative sizes according to user intents, instead of
random relative sizes. This corresponds to setting the argument scales of the function create_seg_mix
in Algorithm 1. As shown in Figure 34, we can personalize models to generate the toy to be larger
31Figure 34: Examples of relative size control using Seg-Mix . During training, we augment the
images of segmented subjects with fixed relative sizes. (a)When the relative size of the toy and the
can is equal (i.e., toy:can=1:1), the generated samples display a toy and a can of similar size. (b)
When we set the relative size of the toy to be smaller than the can (i.e., toy:can=1:2), the generated
samples display a relatively small toy compared to the can. Note that the images of the same positions
in the 3grid are generated using the same random seed.

than the can or vice versa. We observe a consistent relative size of the personalized subjects in the
generated images.
C.2 Modular customization
Our Seg-Mix can also be applied to modular customization, i.e., when we possess single-subject
LoRAs that have been independently fine-tuned to each subject. Instead of re-training the models
each time for new combinations of subjects, we can efficiently merge the pre-trained models that are
independently fine-tuned for each subject, avoiding the need for training from the beginning.
We first generate images of each subject using their corresponding LoRA, which are subsequently
utilized as reference images. We then merge the single-subject fine-tuned LoRAs [ 18] using an
existing method such as gradient fusion [ 14] to obtain a fused model (Figure 35(a)). While the fused
model can successfully generate each subject individually, composing multiple subjects results in
severe identity mixing. Therefore, we apply Seg-Mix with the generated single-subject images for
200-300 iterations (Figure 35(b)). When applying Seg-Mix, we apply a new LoRA to fine-tune
the fused model and set the seg-mix probability to 1. This is because the fused model has already

been trained with each subject and only needs to be trained with the composition of the subjects. In
particular, we add KL regularization [ 11] to the personalization objective (Eq. (2)) in order to prevent
overfitting and saturation. Our approach effectively reduces identity mixing as shown in Figure 35(c).
Notably, we find that for certain subjects, using self-generated images instead of the original refer-
ence images for Seg-Mix fine-tuning achieved superior performance, especially alleviating posture
overfitting. For example, the reference images for the characters from Sora [ 31] (e.g., the otter) are
obtained from the video frames that have highly limited postures. Instead of using the reference
images directly, we can generate diverse images of the subjects using the single-subject LoRAs, and
use them when applying Seg-Mix.
C.3 Iterative training
We present an iterative training (IT) method [ 45] for MuDI to further improve the image quality. The
key idea is to additionally fine-tune the personalized model using high-quality images generated with
MuDI. We introduce a fully automatic training based on our MuDI and the D&C score which closely
aligns with human evaluation for the multi-subject fidelity.
To be specific, we generate 200 multi-subject images with MuDI using simple prompts created by
ChatGPT [ 30], for example, "[ V1] dog and [ V2] dog watching birds from a window sill.". The top
50 images based on the D&C-DS score are used to fine-tune the personalized model using LoRA [ 18].
We fine-tune the model with the KL regularization [ 11] added to the personalization objective LDB
of Eq. (2). In particular, we observe that the KL regularization is crucial for preventing saturation and
preserving the image quality of the self-generated images. Empirically, setting the KL regularization
weight as 1.0 results in a good trade-off between preventing saturation and multi-subject fidelity. We
provide an overview of the iterative training framework in Figure 36.
As shown in Figure 37, IT considerably improves MuDI on personalizing highly similar subjects.
We believe using other RL-based fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) [ 38,51] instead of our supervised fine-tuning approach, would be more robust against over-
saturation and better to reflect human preferences. Additionally, combining different reward models
with RL methods could further improve how well the system aligns with human preferences, which
we leave for future work.

34Figure 38: Personalizing 11 concepts together with MuDI using a single LoRA [ 18].We use
descriptive classes for each dog and cat, for example, Weimaraner or Mudi, which enhances the
ability to personalize multiple subjects that are highly similar.

(a) Remarkably alike subject (b) Complex prompts (b) More than three subjects
Figure 40: Limitations. (a) Remarkably alike subjects are challenging to decouple perfectly as
they lie very close in the latent space. For example, two brown teddy bears can be easily mixed up as
they have highly similar designs and colors. (b) Complex prompts that describe unusual or detailed
scenes bring additional difficulty in preserving the details of the subjects. In this case, the subjects can
be easily ignored during the generation. (c) More than three subjects. MuDI significantly mitigates
identity mixing but often duplicates the same subjects in the generated images.
D Limitations and societal impacts
Limitations We find that decoupling the identities of remarkably alike subjects is still challenging
even for our method, for example, two brown teddy bears in our dataset (see Figure 40(a)). Such
subjects are very close in the image latent space which may be difficult to separate with the current
text-to-image pre-trained models. Furthermore, we observe that our method faces difficulties when
the given prompt is complex. For example, we show in Figure 40(b) that the generated images
of personalized characters with the prompt "[V1] riding on red bobsleigh, [V2] riding on blue
bobsleigh." do not display the kangaroo character. This issue could be alleviated by optimizing to
the specific prompt [ 2]. Lastly, although our framework effectively alleviates identity mixing for
several subjects, we find that subject dominance becomes stronger as the number of personalized
subjects increases. For instance, MuDI may duplicate the same subjects in the generated images, as
in Figure 40(c) Adjusting the γscale in our initialization can address subject dominance but may
yield image saturation. We believe our iterative training framework may potentially address these
limitations and can be further developed by applying recent RLHF approaches [23, 11, 6, 51, 10].
Societal impacts Our method allows for the synthesis of realistic images of multiple personalized
subjects. However, there is a risk that our framework can be misused to generate harmful content
for the public or to include subjects that are sensitive to privacy. To prevent this, it is necessary to
apply measures such as watermarking to the generated images to prevent misuse, as well as protective
watermarking specifically for privacy-sensitive subjects.
37NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and the introduction reflect the paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the work in the Appendix.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
38Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe the details of the experiments in the main paper as well as the
Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
39Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have submitted our code for the experiments as supplementary materials.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the training and test details in the Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We visualize the error bars of our human evaluation results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
40•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe the computer resources used in our experiments in the Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We conform NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss both potential positive and negative societal impacts in the Ap-
pendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
41•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper do not pose such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We properly credit the original owners of assets used in the paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
42•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed details of the dataset/code/model in the Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include information of the human evaluation in the Appendix.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our work does not require IRB approval as it involves human raters evaluating
image preferences from a benchmark dataset and the ratings are collected anonymously. The
study does not pose any potential risks to the participants.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
