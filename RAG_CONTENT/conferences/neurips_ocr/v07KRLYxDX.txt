Abstract
Wepresent knowledgecontinuity ,anoveldefinitioninspiredbyLipschitzcontinuity
which aims to certify the robustness of neural networks across input domains (such
as continuous and discrete domains in vision and language, respectively). Most
existing approaches that seek to certify robustness, especially Lipschitz continuity,
lie within the continuous domain with norm and distribution-dependent guarantees.
In contrast, our proposed definition yields certification guarantees that depend only
onthelossfunctionandtheintermediatelearnedmetricspacesoftheneuralnet-
work. These bounds are independent of domain modality, norms, and distribution.
We further demonstrate that the expressiveness of a model class is not at odds with
its knowledge continuity. This implies that achieving robustness by maximizing
knowledgecontinuityshouldnottheoreticallyhinderinferentialperformance. Fi-
nally, to complement our theoretical results, we present several applications of
knowledgecontinuitysuchasregularization,acertificationalgorithm,andshow
thatknowledgecontinuitycanbeusedtolocalizevulnerablecomponentsofaneural

1 Introduction
Deepneuralnetworks(DNNs)havedemonstratedremarkablegeneralizationcapabilities. Theirrobust-
ness,however,hasbeenconsiderablymoredifficulttoachieve. Robustness referstothepreservationof

ments in robustness improvements through architectural, training, and dataset augmentations, but
also unveiled the sophistication of adversarial attacks —the process through which counterexamples
to robustness are generated [ 1,35,72,75,7]. Along the progress made in these parallel directions, a
greatdealofworkhasgoneinto certifiedrobustness whichseekstoprovidetheoreticalrobustness
guarantees. Certification is desirable as it generally transcends any particular task, dataset, or model.
As a result, Lipschitz continuity has emerged, promising certified robustness by essentially bounding
the derivative of a neural network’s output with respect to its input. In this way, Lipschitz continuity
directly capturesthe volatilityof amodel’s performance,getting atthe heartof robustness. Such an
approachhasprovenitsmeritincomputervision,facilitatingrobustnessundernormanddistributional

architectures such as the Transformer [ 70] are provably notLipschitz continuous [ 36].Most of these
challenges are not unique to language, and they represent a strong divide of our understanding of
robustness in discrete/non-metrizable and continuous domains [22, 46].
Toaddresstheseissues,weproposeanewconceptualframeworkwhichwecall knowledgecontinuity .
At its core, we adopt the following axiom:
Robustness is the stability of a model’s performance
with respect to its perceived knowledge of input-output relations.
Concretely,ourframeworkisgroundedonthepremisethatrobustnessisbetterachievedbyfocusingon
thevariabilityofamodel’slosswithrespecttoitshiddenrepresentations,ratherthanforcingarbitrary
metrics on its inputs and outputs. Our approach results in certification guarantees independent of
domain modality, norms, and distribution. We demonstrate that the expressiveness of a model class
is not at odds with its knowledge continuity. In other words, achieving robustness by improving
knowledge continuity should not theoretically hinder inferential performance. We show that in
continuous settings (i.e. computer vision) knowledge continuity generalizes Lipschitz continuity
andinheritsits tightrobustnessbounds. Finally,we presentanarrayof practicalapplicationsusing

model’s loss with respect to its hidden representations.
•We theoretically show that knowledge continuity results in certified robustness guarantees that
generalize across modalities (continuous, discrete, and non-metrizable). Moreover, this robustness
does not come at the expense of inferential performance.

There have been extensive studies on developing robust neural networks with theoretical guarantees.
With respect to our contributions, they can be organized into the following categories.

with respect to the 𝓁2-norm [11,86,25,2,38,29,4]. A recent push, fueled by new architectural
developments, has also expanded these results into 𝓁∞-norm perturbations [ 89,88,90]. Further,

Though Lipschitz continuity has seen much success in continuous domains, it does not apply to non-
metrizabledomains suchas language. Further, architecturallimitations ofprevalent modelssuch as
2the Transformer [ 70,36] exacerbate this problem. These challenges highlight a critical need for a
new approach that can accommodate the specificities of discrete and non-metrizable domains while
providing robustness guarantees.
Achieving robustness in discrete/non-metrizable spaces. Non-metrizable spaces, where it is non-
trivial to construct a distance metric on the input/output domains, pose a unique challenge to certified
robustness. Instead of focusing on point-wise perturbations, many studies have opted to examine
howtheoutputprobabilitydistributionofamodelchangeswithrespecttoinputdistributionshifts
byleveraginginformationbottleneckmethods[ 67,73,53](seealsoout-of-distributiongeneraliza-
tion: [42,83,60]). Most of these bounds lack granularity and cannot be expressed in closed-form.
In contrast to these theoretical approaches, recent efforts have refocused on directly adapting the
principles underlying Lipschitz continuity to language. Virtual adversarial training methods such
as [43,85] mimic the measurement of Lipschitz continuity by comparing changes in the textual
embeddings with the KL-divergence of the output logits. Along these lines, techniques akin to those
used in adversarial training in vision have also been translated to language, reflecting a shift towards
robustness centered around the learned representation space [ 40,23,35]. Though these approaches
have seen empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees. As a result, their implementations
and success rate is heavily task-dependent [ 43,85]. There have also been attempts to mitigate the
non-LipschitznessofTransformers[ 87,82]bymodifyingitsarchitecture. Thesechanges,however,
add significant computational overhead.
Other robustness approaches. In parallel, other certified robustness approaches such as randomized
smoothing[ 12,39,37]givestate-of-the-artcertificationfor 𝓁2-basedperturbations. Notableworks
suchas[34,74]havesoughttogeneralizethesetechniquesintolanguage,buttheirguaranteesstrongly
depend on the type of perturbation being performed. On the other hand, analytic approaches through
convexrelaxationinductivelyboundtheoutputofneuronsinaReLUnetworkacrosslayers[ 79,81,77].
These works, however, are difficult to scale and also do not transfer easily to discrete/non-metrizable
domains.
Our approach, inspired by Lipschitz continuity, distills the empirical intuitions from the works
of[43,85]andprovidestheoreticalcertificationguaranteesindependentofperturbation-type[ 34,74]
and domain modality. We demonstrate that knowledge continuity yields many practical applications
analogous to Lipschitz continuity which are easy to implement and are computationally competitive.

4 Knowledge Continuity
In this section, we provide the formal definition of knowlege continuity and explore its theoretical
properties.
We start by defining a model’s perceived knowledge through a rigorous treatment of its hidden
representationspaces. Byconsideringthedistancebetweeninputsinsomerepresentationspacein
conjunctionwithchangesinloss,weresultinameasureof volatilityanalogoustoLipschitzcontinuity.
3Boundingthisvolatilityinexpectationthendirectlyleadstoournotionofknowledgecontinuity. With
these tools, we demonstrate a host of theoretical properties of knowledge continuity including its
certification ofrobustness, guarantees ofexpressiveness,and connections toLipschitz continuity in
continuous settings. We summarize our theoretical contributions as follows:
•Wedefinetheperceivedknowledgeofamodelaswellasvolatilityandknowledgecontinuitywithin
a model’s representation space (see Def. 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively).
•Weprovethatknowledgecontinuityimplies probabilistic certifiedrobustnessunderperturbationsin
therepresentationspaceandconstrainingknowledgecontinuityshouldnothindertheexpressiveness
of the class of neural networks (see Thm. 4.1 and Prop. 4.3, 4.4, respectively).
•Weprovethat in some cases knowledge continuity is equivalent (in expectation) to Lipschitz
continuity. This shows that our axiomization of robustness aligns with existing results when
perturbation with respect to the input is well-defined (see Prop. 4.6, 4.8).
4.1 Defining Perceived Knowledge
Knowledgeisgenerallyunderstoodasarelationalconcept: itarisesfromtheconnectionswemake
between ideas, experiences, and stimuli [ 26]. Herein, we capture the perceived knowledge of a model
byfocusingontherelationsitassignstoinput-inputpairs. Specifically, theserelationsareexposedby
decomposing a function 𝑓∶→into projections to intermediate metric spaces. Formally,
Definition1 (MetricDecomposition) .Wesaythat𝑓admitsametricdecompositionifthereexists
metric spaces (1,𝑑1),…,(𝑛,𝑑𝑛)with metrics 𝑑𝑘for𝑘∈[𝑛]such that
1.(𝑘,𝑑𝑘)is endowed with its Borel 𝜎-algebra.
2.Thereexistsmeasurablemappings ℎ0,ℎ1,…,ℎ𝑛whereℎ0∶→1,ℎ𝑘∶𝑘→𝑘+1for
𝑘∈[𝑛−1], andℎ𝑛∶𝑛→.
3.𝑓=ℎ𝑛◦ℎ𝑛−1◦…◦ℎ1◦ℎ0.
Remark1.Ifisametricspacewithmetric 𝑑andisitsBorel𝜎-algebra,thenforanymeasurable
mapping𝑓∶→there exists the trivial metric decomposition
𝑓=𝑓◦Id. (4.1)
Therefore, in computer vision applications where (,𝑑)=(ℝ𝑛,𝓁𝑝)for some𝑛∈ℤ+, we can apply
this trivial decomposition to yield bounds which mirror the certification guarantees of Lipschitz
continuity. This is discussed in detail in Section 4.5.
To the best of our knowledge, all deep learning architectures admit metric decompositions, since
their activations are generally real-valued. So, for all subsequent functions from to, unless
otherwisespecified,weassumetheyaremeasurableandpossessametricdecomposition. Further,
we denote𝑓𝑘=ℎ𝑘◦ℎ𝑘−1◦…◦ℎ1◦ℎ0and adopt the convention of calling ℎ𝑘the𝑘thhidden layer. In
Appendix A, we present several metric decompositions for a variety of architectures.
For any metric-decomposible function, an immediate consequence of our definition is that its metric
decomposition may not be unique. However, in the context of neural networks, this is a desirable
property. Seminal works from an array of deep learning subfields such as semi-supervised learn-
ing[57],manifoldlearning[ 51],andinterpretability[ 10,47]placegreatemphasisonthequalityof
learnedrepresentationspacesbyexaminingtheinduced-topologyoftheirmetrics. Thisoftendoes
not affect the typical performance of the estimator, but has strong robustness implications [ 33]. Our
results,which aredependentonparticularmetricdecompositions, capturethistrend. InSection 4.4,
we discuss in detail the effects of various metric decompositions on our theoretical results.
4.2 Defining Knowledge Continuity
We first introduce what it means for a model’s performance to be volatile at a data point relative to its
metricdecomposition. Then,wecontrastknowledgecontinuitywithLipschitzcontinuity,pointing
out key differences that will allow us to prove more general bounds.
Definition2 (𝑘-Volatility) .Let𝑓∶→andbeanylossfunction. The 𝑘-volatilityofapoint
(𝑥,𝑦)∈×which we denote as 𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)is given by

variation in loss]
,(4.3)
Our notion of volatility essentially measures the change in performance with respect to perturbations
to a model’s perceived knowledge. In particular, Eq. 4.3 reveals that there are two interactions
in play which we illustrate in Fig. 1. Informally, we say that (𝑥,𝑦)is highly volatile if there is a
large discrepancy in performance between it and points that are perceived to be conceptually similar.
Therefore,highlyvolatilepointscaptureinaccurateinput-inputknowledgerelations. Additionally,
(𝑥,𝑦)experiences low volatility if the space around it is sparse with respect to ,. In other words,
any set of perturbations applied in 𝑘would push(𝑥,𝑦)far away, with high probability. This makes
(𝑥,𝑦)an isolated concept with little knowledge relationships associated with it.
SimilartoLipschitzcontinuity, theboundedness ofthe 𝑘-volatility of 𝑓acrossthe datadistribution is
crucial and we denote this class of functions as knowledge continuous .
Definition 3 (Pointwise𝜖-Knowledge Continuity) .We say that 𝑓is𝜖-knowledge continuous at
(𝑥,𝑦)∈×with respect to a function 𝑓, loss function , and hidden layer 𝑘if𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)<𝜖.
Conversely, we say that (𝑥,𝑦)is𝜖-knowledge discontinuous if the previous inequality does not hold.
Further,(𝑥,𝑦)is simply knowledge discontinuous if 𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)is unbounded. Now, we extend this
definition globally by considering the 𝑘-volatility between all pairs of points.
5Definition 4 (Expected𝜖-Knowledge Continuity) .We say that 𝑓is𝜖-knowledge continuous with
respect to a loss function and hidden layer 𝑘if
𝔼(𝑥,𝑦)∼[𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)]<𝜖. (4.4)
Though thefunctional forms ofLipschitz continuity andknowledge continuityare similar, thereare
important differences that allow us to prove more general results. Firstly, unlike Lipschitz continuity
which is an analytical property of the model 𝑓, knowledge continuity is a statistical one. In this
way, non-typical data points, even if they are volatile, are ignored, whereas Lipschitz continuity
treatsallpointsequally. Thisisnecessaryinmanydiscreteapplications,asprojectingacountable
input space onto a non-countable metric space inevitably results in a lack of correspondence thereof.
Moreover,ground-truthrelationsfrom →maynotbewell-definedon allof: considersentiment
classification of an alpha-numeric UUID string or dog-cat classification of Gaussian noise. Secondly,
the knowledge continuity of an estimator is measured with respect to the loss function rather than
itsoutput. ThispropertyallowsustoachievetheexpressivenessguaranteesinSection4.4,sinceit
places no restrictions on the function class of estimators. Lastly, knowledge continuity measures the
distancebetweeninputswiththeendowedmetricinitshiddenlayers. Thisflexibilityallowsusto
define knowledge continuity even when the input domain is not a metric space.
4.3 Certification of Robustness
Our first main result demonstrates that 𝜖-knowledge continuity implies probabilistic certified robust-
nessinthehiddenrepresentationspace. InTheorem4.1,givensomereferenceset 𝐴⊂×,we
bound the probability that a 𝛿-sized perturbation in the representation space away from 𝐴will result
in an expected 𝜂change in loss. In other words, knowledge continuity is able to characterize the
robustness of any subset of data points with positive measure.
Theorem 4.1. Let𝐴 ⊂ ×such that ℙ,[𝐴]>0and𝛿,𝜂 >0. Let𝐴′={
(𝑥′,𝑦′)∈×∶𝔼(𝑥,𝑦)∼,
(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝐴Δ(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑓(𝑥′,𝑦′)>𝜂}
. If𝑓∶→is𝜖-knowledge continuous
with respect to the hidden layer indexed by 𝑘and(𝑘,𝑑𝑘)is bounded by 𝐵>0, then
ℙ(𝑥,𝑦)∼,[𝐴′∣𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿]≤𝜖𝛿
𝜂(
1−exp[
−Ω(
𝛿
𝐵−√
log1
ℙ[𝐴])2]).(4.5)
Proof sketch. We apply the definition of conditional probability 𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) =𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)∕𝑃(𝐵)and
bound𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵),𝑃(𝐵),separately. Thenumerator, ℙ[𝐴′and𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿],isupper-bounded
through an application of Markov’s Inequality. On the other hand, we apply known concentration
inequalities to lower bound ℙ[𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿], combining these results in the theorem. We
present the proof in its entirety in Appendix B. ■
This demonstrates that knowledge continuity results in certification of robustness, independent of
distancemetricanddomainmodality. Theassumptionofboundednessandrequirementtoknow ℙ[𝐴]
canbelostbytakinglimitsofEq.4.5withrespectto 𝐵andℙ[𝐴]. Thisyieldsthefollowingcorollary.
Corollary 4.2. If(𝑘,𝑑𝑘)is unbounded, then
ℙ(𝑥,𝑦)∼,[𝐴′∣𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿]≤𝜖𝛿
𝜂(1−ℙ[𝐴]). (4.6)
Ifℙ[𝐴]=0, then
ℙ(𝑥,𝑦)∼,[𝐴′∣𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿]≤𝜖𝛿
𝜂. (4.7)
Proof.Theseresultsfollowfromdirectlytakingthelimitas 𝐵→∞andapplyingsomeofthebounds
acquired in the proof of Thm. 4.1. This yields Eq. 4.6. Next, jointly taking the limit as ℙ[𝐴]→0and
𝐵→∞results in Eq. 4.7. ■
InbothThm.4.1andCor.4.7,weyieldprobabilisticguaranteeslike[ 12],ratherthandeterministic
ones. Though deterministic bounds are desirable, the stochasticity of our framework is necessary
6for its generalization across different domains. For most continuous, metrizable applications (like
computer vision), models learn a hidden representation space where most minute changes in this
spacecorrespondtotangibleinputs. Thesamecannotbesaidformanydiscreteornon-metrizable
applications. In natural language processing, the correspondence between the learned representation
space and the input is sparse, resulting in lots of “dead space”: portions of the hidden representation
space that do not correspond to any input [ 3,19]. And so, by incorporating the data distribution into
our bounds, we implicitly adjust for this: assigning zero-measure to the aforementioned “dead space.”
4.4 Expressiveness
Oursecondmainresultdemonstratesthat 𝜖-knowledgecontinuitycanbeachievedwithouttheoretically
compromising the accuracy of the model. In other words, universal function approximation is an
invariantpropertywithrespectto 𝜖-knowledgecontinuity. Universalapproximationresultshaveseena
greatdealoftheoreticalwork,astheyputlimitsonwhatneuralnetworkscanrepresent[ 15,31,45]. As
discussedinSection2,Lipschitzcontinuousfunctionsdonotachieveuniversalfunctionapproximation
withrespecttothesetofallfunctions,inparticular,non-continuousones. However,weshowthat
under strong conditions this is achievable with knowledge continuity.
First, let us formally define a universal function approximator .
Definition 5 (Universal Function Approximator) .Suppose that is Lebesgue-integrable in both
coordinates. Let ⊂beasetofmeasurablefunctionsfrom →suchthatforany 𝑓∈,there
exists𝜇𝑓≪,suchthat𝜇𝑓(graph(𝑓))=1. Then, ⊂isauniversalfunctionapproximator
ofif for every𝑓∈and every𝜖>0, there exists ̂𝑓∈such that
∫(̂𝑓(𝑥),𝑦)𝑑𝜇𝑓<𝜖. (4.8)
We now show any universal function approximator can be made robust through the trivial metric
decomposition.
Proposition 4.3. Let⊂be a universal function approximator of with respect to some loss
function . Then,forany 𝑓∈andsequence 𝜖1,𝜖2,…suchthat𝜖𝑛→0thereare asequenceof
𝜖𝑛-knowledge continuous functions in such that ∫(𝑓𝑛(𝑥),𝑦)𝑑𝜇𝑓<𝜖𝑛, for𝑛∈ℕ.
Proof.Choose𝑓𝑛∈such that ∫(𝑓𝑛(𝑥),𝑦)𝑑𝜇𝑓<1
2𝜖𝑛. Consider the 1-layer metric decomposi-
tion of𝑓,ℎ1∶→1where 1=equipped with the trivial metric ( 𝑑1(𝑥,𝑦)=1if𝑥≠𝑦and 0
otherwise). Then, 𝑓𝑛=𝑓𝑛◦ℎ1. So, it follows that
𝔼𝜎1
𝑓𝑛(𝑥,𝑦)=∫Δ(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑓𝑛(𝑥′,𝑦′)
𝑑1(ℎ1(𝑥),ℎ1(𝑥′))𝑑𝜇𝑓,
≤∫Δ(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑓𝑛(𝑥′,𝑦′)𝑑𝜇𝑓,
≤𝜖𝑛.
and by the construction of 𝑓𝑛, the proof is completed. ■
In other words, if our estimator was given “infinite representational capacity,” robustness can be
trivially achieved by isolating every point as its own concept (as discussed in Section 4.2). More
generally, if we instead considered a generalized discrete metric (fix 𝑐∈[0,∞],𝑑(𝑥,𝑦)=𝑐if and
onlyif𝑥=𝑦and𝑑(𝑥,𝑦)=0,otherwise),thenas 𝑐→∞,𝑘-volatilityconvergespointwiseto0almost
everywhere assuming that the loss is finite almost everywhere. In practice, we find these degenerate
decompositions tobe unreasonableas they alsotrivializerobustness. Forexample, if 𝑐=∞, then
robustnessisnotwell-definedasanyperturbationwouldleadtoapointthatisperceivedtobeinfinitely
far away. In this sense, our framework accounts for different notions of robustness, strong and
weak.The next result builds on Prop. 4.3 and demonstrates how a stronger notion of robustness
will affect expressiveness. These added constraints make it so that trivial metric decompositions
arenolongerpossibleunlessthemetricin isalsotrivial. Westatethisformallybelow,notethe
highlighted differences between this and Prop. 4.3.
Proposition4.4. Suppose(,𝑑),(,𝑑)∶=(,𝑑)arecompactmetricspaces, ⊂isthe
set of all continuous functions fromtosuch that ∫𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′)−1𝑑𝜇𝑓<∞andbe Lipschitz
continuous in both coordinates. Then, there exists a universal function approximator ofthat is
knowledge continuous (i.e. 𝔼𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)<∞for some𝑘).
7Proof sketch. We show an outline of the proof here and defer the full proof to Appendix C. By
the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, the set of Lipschitz continuous functions is dense in the set of all
continuousfunctionsfrom to. Since isLipschitzcontinuousinbothcoordinates,throughsome
algebra, 𝔼𝜎1
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)<∞, whereℎ1=Idand we yield the statement of the theorem. ■
The additional constraint ∫𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′)−1𝑑𝜇𝑓requires data points to be sparsely layed out in the
representationspace. Asdiscussedpreviously,thisassumptionisgenerallyreasonablefordiscrete
applications. InconjunctionwithProp.4.3,wehaveshownthattheclassofknowledgecontinuous
functionsis strictlylarger thantheclassofLipschitzcontinuousones. Thoughweshowthatuniversal
approximationbyknowledgecontinuousnetworksisachievable,itisunclearwhethertheseresults
stillholdifthe“tightness”ofthemetricdecompositionsisbounded. Specifically,theconstruction
in Prop. 4.3 results in a metric decomposition with infinite Hausdorff dimension. Is it possible to
achieve Prop. 4.3 in its most general form if we only consider the set of all knowledge continuous
functions with metric decompositions with finite Hausdorff dimension? Based on the theoretical and

4.5 Connections to Lipschitz Continuity
WenowdemonstratethatouraxiomizationofrobustnesspresentedinSection1alignswiththenotion
of robustness2commonly prescribed in vision [ 18]. This unifies the certified robustness bounds with
respect to the representation space derived in Thm. 4.1 with existing work certifying robustness with
respect to the input space in continuous applications such as vision.
Our first result identifies conditions under which knowledge continuity, implies Lipschitz continuity.
Proposition 4.6. Suppose that (,𝑑),(,𝑑)are metric spaces. Let the first 𝑛metric decompo-
sitionsof𝑓∶→be𝐾𝑖-Lipschitzcontinuous,for 𝑖∈[𝑛]. If𝑓is𝜖-knowledgecontinuouswith
respectto the 𝑛thhidden layerand 𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑓(𝑥′))≤𝜂Δ(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑓(𝑥′,𝑦)for all𝑥,𝑥′∈,𝑦∈, and
some𝜂>0, then𝑓is Lipschitz continuous in expectation. That is,
𝔼(𝑥,𝑦),(𝑥′,𝑦′)∼,𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑓(𝑥′))
𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′)≤𝜖𝜂𝑛∏

Theproof ispresented inAppendix Dand follows easilythrough somealgebriac manipulation. Itis
easytoseethatif 𝑓isknowledgecontinuouswithrespecttosomeidentity(orcontractive)metric
decomposition, then we can loose the repeated product. Analogous to Remark 1, the concepts of
Lipschitz continuity and knowledge continuity become similar when we can assign metrics to the
input-output spaces. Next, combining this proposition with an auxiliary result from [ 89], we directly
yield a certification on the input space.
Corollary 4.7. Suppose that assumptions of Prop. 4.6 are true. And also assume that (,𝑑) =
(ℝ𝑛,𝓁𝑝),(,𝑑) = (ℝ𝑚,𝓁𝑝), for1≤𝑝≤∞. Define a classifier from 𝑓∶ℝ𝑛→ℝ𝑚,𝑔, where

and(𝑓(𝑥),𝑦)be𝜂-Lipschitz continuous with respect to both coordinates. If the first 𝑛metric

We detail theproof of this proposition in Appendix D.We note that in continuous applicationssuch
as computer vision, the assumptions of both propositions are generally met (i.e. our input-output
spaces are metric spaces, all hidden layers are Lipschitz, and loss functions are locally Lipschitz).
Furthermore, commonarchitecturessuchasfullyconnectednetworks, CNNs, RNNs, andevenvision
transformers are Lipschitz continuous [ 71,55].This implies that our notion of robustness is indeed
an appropriate generalization that transcends domain modality since in continuous settings we
can recover the strong bounds of Lipschitz continuity while expanding into new discrete and
non-metrizable territory.
5 Practical Applications
In addition to the theoretical guarantees given by knowledge continuity in Section 4, we also demon-
strate that knowledge continuity can be easily applied in practice. First, we find that knowledge
continuity, similar to Lipschitz continuity, can be used to gauge adversarial robustness. Along these
lines, our measure of volatility (see Def. 2) can be used to isolate particularly vulnerable hidden
representations. Theseapplicationsthendirectlymotivateregulationofknowledgecontinuityasa
means to enforce robustness.
Unless otherwise specified, we run all of our experiments on the IMDB dataset [ 48] (a sentiment
classification task) using a host of language models from different model families (encoder, decoder,
encoder-decoder). We also present additional experiments on vision tasks. These experiments can be
found in the Appendix G.
Knowledgecontinuitycanpredictadversarialrobustness. Foragivenmodel, 𝑓,with𝑛hidden
representations, choose some 𝑘∈ [𝑛]. Then, consider the hidden representation index by 𝑘. For
this fixed𝑘, we determine its 𝑘-volatility by directly estimating Def. 2 through a naive Monte-Carlo
algorithm (see Appendix G for more details). Repeating this for all 𝑘∈[𝑛], we yield a collection of
𝑘-volatilitieswhichwedenoteas {𝜖1,…,𝜖𝑛},oneforeachhiddenlayer. Whenweregressasimple
average of these coefficients, 𝑛−1∑𝑛
𝑘=1𝜖𝑘, with the empirical adversarial robustness (estimated using
TextFooler[ 35]),astrongcorrelationisobserved. ThisisshowninFig.2(a). Inparticular,knowledge
continuityaloneisabletoexplain35%ofthevarianceinadversarialattacksuccessrate. Whenwe
combine𝑘-volatility with other model properties like size, model family, even more variance can
beexplained( 𝑅2=0.48). Thus,knowledgecontinuitymaybeusedasacomputationallyefficient
method to estimate adversarial vulnerability with respect to the input space as compared to iteratively
applying real adversarial attacks. Moreover, when the adversary is unknown a priori, knowledge
continuitycanalsobeusedinthiswayasadiagnostictool. Adetaileddiscussionoftheseexperiments
are presented in Appendix E.

oradversarialdefenses. Forexample,wheninsightsfromFig.2(b)arecombinedwithaknowledge
continuityregularizationalgorithm,thisyieldssuperiorempiricalrobustnesscomparedtoexisting
methods. This is shown in the next subsection and in Appendix G. In addition, knowledge continuity
can also quantitatively characterize an adversarial attack against a host of models which is useful for
online or adaptive defenses [ 84,64,14]. This is shown in in Fig. 2(c), where TextFooler [ 35] largely
exploits the knowledge continuities in middle/final layers of the model to decrease performance.
Regulating knowledge continuity. Motivated by the theoretical results in Section 4, we augment the
loss function during training to mitigate knowledge continuity. Specifically, on each training iteration
(batch), we start by choosing a hidden layer at random according to a Beta distribution determined a
priori:𝑋∼Beta(𝛼,𝛽)and let𝑘=⌊𝑛𝑋⌋. Here,𝛼,𝛽are chosen according to Fig. 2(b,c). We assign
larger sampling probability to layers where both 𝑘-volatility is high and where knowledge continuity
is highly correlated with adversarial robustness. In this way, our regularization objective is both
modelandattackspecific(iftheattackmethodisunknown,thenweonlyapplytheformer). Then,
we devise a Monte-Carlo algorithm to estimate this layer’s 𝑘-volatility,𝜖𝑘, (see Appendix G) on this
minibatch. And so, the augmented loss function becomes ′(𝑓(𝑥),𝑦)=(𝑓(𝑥),𝑦)+𝜆𝜖𝑘with𝜆≥0
asahyperparameter,controllingtheregularizationstrength. Incontrasttoexistingadversarialtraining
methods that perform inner-optimization steps [ 50,43,85], our method requires only additional
zeroth-order computations. As a result, it outperforms existing works in training speed (up to 2×for
TextFooler [ 35] and3×for ALUM [ 43]), while improving robustness. We present a discussion of the
results, ablation studies, and training details in Appendix G.
Certifying robustness withknowledgecontinuity. We present analgorithm based on Thm. 4.1 to
certifyrobustnessduringtest-time. Similarto[ 12],weestimatetheprobabilityofthereexistingan
adversarial example within some fixed radius (in the representation space, according to a pre-defiend
distancemetric)throughbootstrappingaone-sideconfidenceinterval. Applyingthesemethodsto
our regularization results, we show that regularizing knowledge continuity increases the certified
robustness. The certification algorithm, its proof of correctness, and certifications of our regularized
models are presented in Appendix H.
6 Conclusion
Inthispaper,wepropose anoveldefinition, knowledgecontinuity ,whichaddressessomeofthe key
limitations of Lipschitz robustness. We demonstrate that our definition certifies robustness across
domainmodality,distribution,andnorms. Wealsoshowthatknowledgecontinuity,incontrastto
Lipschitzcontinuity,doesnotaffecttheuniversalapproximationpropertyofneuralnetworks. We
also establish conditions under which knowledge continuity and Lipschitz continuity are equivalent.
Lastly, we present several practical applications that directly benefit the practitioner. The broader
impacts, reproducibility, and limitations of our work can be found in Appendix I, J, K, respectively.

17A More on Metric Decompositions
InSection4.1,weintroducedthenotionofa metricdecomposition torigorouslydefinethehidden
representations of a neural network. Herein, we show that our notion of a metric decomposition
well-describesahostofneuralarchitecturesandalsopointtopossibleapplicationsofthisconcept
beyondjustdeeplearning. Letusfirstconsiderpossiblemetricdecompositionsofcommonneural
architectures.
A.1 Metric Decompositions of Common Neural Architectures
Fully-Connected Neural Network. Suppose that 𝑓∶ℝ𝑑→ℝ𝑚is a fully-connected neural network
with𝑛hiddenlayers. Eachhiddenlayerindexedby 𝑖∈[𝑛]hasaweightmatrix 𝑊𝑖∈ℝ𝑑𝑖+1×𝑑𝑖,bias
𝑏𝑖∈ℝ𝑑𝑖+1, and activation function 𝜎𝑖∶ℝ𝑑𝑖+1→ℝ𝑑𝑖+1, where𝑑𝑖∈ℕ,𝑑1=𝑑,𝑑𝑛=𝑚. Define the
hidden layers as
ℎ𝑘(𝑥)=𝜎𝑘(𝑊𝑘𝑥+𝑏𝑘),
for all𝑘∈[𝑛]. Clearly,𝑓=ℎ𝑛◦ℎ𝑛−1◦…◦ℎ1. Andour intermediatespaces aresimply {ℝ𝑑𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1. It
remains to define a metric on these hidden spaces. There are many ways of doing this. For example,
•For any1≤𝑝≤∞, endow each intermediate space with the 𝓁𝑝-norm.
•Define𝑑(𝑥,𝑦)=1−cos(𝜃𝑥,𝑦)where𝜃𝑥,𝑦istheanglebetween 𝑥,𝑦. Then,ifwechoose 𝜎𝑖to
restricttheimageof ℎ𝑖tobetheunitsphere,wemayendoweachintermediatespacewith
thiscosine distance .
Note here that there are two steps here: we first identify what the intermediate spaces are, then assign
metrics to them. The process of identfying these intermediate spaces may be independent of the
metrics we end of assigning them.
ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork. Forsimplicity,weonlyconsiderthecaseofasingle2d-convolution
layer, a convolutional network with higher dimensions or more layers can be derived inductively.
Let𝑓∶ℝ𝑐×ℎ×𝑤→ℝ𝑐′×ℎ′×𝑤′. Suppose that this layer is parameterized by kernels 𝑊𝑖∈ℝ𝑘×𝑘for
𝑖∈[𝑐′]and some𝑘∈ℕas well as a bias 𝑏∈ℝ𝑐′. Then, it follows that
𝑓(𝑥)𝑗=(
𝟏ℎ′×𝑤′𝑏𝑗+𝑐∑
𝑖=1𝑊𝑗∗𝑥[𝑖,∶,∶])
,
for𝑗∈[𝑐′]where𝑓(𝑥)𝑗∈ℝℎ′×𝑤′forℎ′,𝑤′being the resulting dimension after convolution with a
𝑘×𝑘kernel. Here, 𝟏ℎ′×𝑤′∈ℝℎ′×𝑤′isaonematrix. Toinduceadistancemetriconthisoutputspace,
we can simply define a matrix norm on each of the output channels and sum them. Let {‖⋅‖𝑖}𝑐′
𝑖=1be a
collection of matrix norms. Then, we define
𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑓(𝑥′))=𝑐′∑
𝑖=1‖‖𝑓(𝑥)𝑖−𝑓(𝑥′)𝑖‖‖𝑖.
Itiseasytoverifythatthisisametric. Thus,theavailabilityofametricdecompositionisnotaffected
by parameter sharing.
Insteadofincorporatingeveryindividualchannelintoourmetric,wemayalsoconsiderapplyinga
pooling operation before passing the result through a single matrix norm, ‖⋅‖. For example,
𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑓(𝑥′))=1
𝑐′‖‖‖‖‖‖𝑐′∑
𝑖=1𝑓(𝑥)𝑖−𝑐′∑
𝑖=1𝑓(𝑥′)𝑖‖‖‖‖‖‖.
This,however,isnolongerametric,asdefinitenessisnotpreserved. Thatis,thereexists 𝑓(𝑥)≠𝑓(𝑥′)
where𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑓(𝑥′))=0. This issue can be easily resolved by having 𝑑(⋅,⋅)operate on a quotient
space with respect to the equivalence relation 𝑓(𝑥)∼𝑓(𝑥′)if and only if∑𝑐′
𝑖=1𝑓(𝑥)𝑖=∑𝑐′
𝑖=1𝑓(𝑥′)𝑖.
This technique is further explored in the next subsection.
ResidualConnections. Wepresenttwodistinctmetricdecompositionsofaresidualnetwork. Consider
two fully-connected layers with one residual connection. This is visualized below.
18𝑥 𝐴(𝑥) 𝐵(𝐴(𝑥)) 𝐵(𝐴(𝑥))+𝑥 𝐴(⋅) 𝐵(⋅)
+𝑥
Let us assume that 𝐴∶ℝ𝑑1→ℝ𝑑2and𝐵∶ℝ𝑑2→ℝ𝑑1. Here, the input 𝑥feeds back into the output
layer𝐵creating a residual block (the set of layers between the input and the residual connection).
Trivially, we can aggregate the entire residual block as one metric decomposition. That is, let
ℎ(𝑥) =𝐵(𝐴(𝑥))+𝑥be our metric decomposition. Then, define a metric on the image of ℎ,ℝ𝑑1,
analogous to the hidden layers of a fully-connected neural network. This is the approach we use
throughout our practical applications section (Section 5), and it is the standard way to counter layers
in computer vision [27] and natural langauge processing [16].
To operate at a finer lever of granularity, we can also represent each layer within the residual block as
a part of a metric decomposition. Let us redefine the residual block such that at every layer, we keep
track of the input. The computational graph for this is shown below.
𝑥 (𝐴(𝑥),𝑥) (𝐵(𝐴(𝑥)),𝑥) (𝐵(𝐴(𝑥))+𝑥,𝑥) 𝐴(⋅)⊕𝑥 𝐵(⋅) +𝑥
Define𝐴′∶𝑥↦(𝐴(𝑥),𝑥),𝐵′∶(𝐴(𝑥),𝑥)↦(𝐵(𝐴(𝑥)),𝑥)and𝑥′∶(𝐵(𝐴(𝑥)),𝑥)↦(𝐵(𝐴(𝑥))+𝑥,𝑥).
Then, it follows that 𝑥→𝐴′→𝐵′→𝑥′forms a metric decomposition. Here, the metric in each
layeriswithrespecttothequotientspacewhere (𝑎,𝑎′)∼(𝑏,𝑏′)ifandonlyif 𝑎=𝑏. Therefore,we
also recover the same vector space structure.
Transformers. By chaining our metric decompositions for the residual blocks with our metric
decompositions for the fully-connected networks we can easily create a metric decomposition for any
transformer. Throughout the paper, we use two distinct methods to generate representations of its
hidden layers:
•After each attention block which consists of multiheaded attention and multilayered percep-
trons, we retrieve the last token.
•We average all of the tokens together.
Inbothofthesemethods,wearesignificantlyreducingthedimensionofthehiddenlayer. Thus,to
formalizethesemetrics,weneedtoquotientoutpointsthatbreakthedefinitenessofourmetric,as
we have done before with the residual block.
A.2 Beyond Neural Networks: Inducing Metric Decompositions
We have shown that our notion of a metric decomposition can well-describe many deep learning
architectures,butwhataboutmodelsthatarenotneuralnetworks(likeadecisiontree)? Herein,we
demonstrate that we can induce metric decompositions even when the model itself does not have
explicit hidden layers.
Let us now consider an arbitrary function 𝑓∶→. We can induce a metric decomposition on
𝑓through an auxiliary function 𝑓′∶→, for a metric-decomposable 𝑓′. If𝑓′=Id, then,
𝑓=𝑓◦𝑓′and the metric decomposition of 𝑓would be exactly the metric decomposition of 𝑓′. This
is visualized below.

…(𝑛,𝑑𝑛)  𝑓′
0𝑓′
1𝑓′
𝑛−1𝑓′
𝑛 𝑓
Metric Decomposition of 𝑓′
Essentially, we have created an autoencoder for . This is common in many applications where a
neural network or some other method is used as a feature extractor. In this way, we can simply define
our metric with respect to these extracted features. However, this requires that either the autoencoder
19to be exact or that our function 𝑓is invariant under representations that collide. Thus, this would
allow models such as decision trees to also be metric decomposed.

Proof.
ℙ(𝑥,𝑦)∼,[𝐴′∣𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿]=ℙ(𝑥,𝑦)∼,[𝐴′∩𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿]
ℙ(𝑥,𝑦)∼,[𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿].(B.2)
We bound the numerator and denominator of Eq. B.2 separately. The denominator is given by
Cor. B.3. We upper-bound the numerator using Markov’s inequality. Firstly, we find the expectation
of(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑓(𝑥′,𝑦′)over𝐴′∩𝑑𝑘(𝑓𝑘(𝑥),𝑓𝑘(𝐴))<𝛿:
𝔼(𝑥,𝑦)∼,𝜎𝑘

The previous inequality follows from Fubini’s theorem, then

And by𝜖-knowledge continuity,

(𝑥′,𝑦′)∈𝐴

Thisgivesusanupper-boundofexpectationof Δ(𝑥,𝑦)

The last inequality follows from 𝔼(𝑥,𝑦)∼,𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)<𝜖, by the definition of 𝜖-knowledge continuity.
Now, by applying the complement of Lem. B.2, we lower-bound the denominator and yield the
following

C Proof of Expressiveness
Proposition (See Prop. 4.4) .Suppose(,𝑑),(,𝑑)∶= (,𝑑)arecompact metric spaces,
⊂is theset of all continuous functions fromtosuch that ∫𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′)−1𝑑𝜇𝑓<∞and
be Lipschitz continuous in both coordinates. Then, there exists a universal function approximator 
ofthat is knowledge continuous (i.e. 𝔼𝜎𝑘
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)<∞for some𝑘).
Proof.By Lem. C.3, the set of Lipschitz continuous functions ℒis dense in the set of all contin-
uous functions 𝒞with respect to the uniform metric. By Lem. C.1, since |(𝑥,𝑦)|≤𝐾𝑑(𝑥,𝑦), if
sup𝑥∈𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑔(𝑥))<𝜖, then for any probability measure ℙover,
∫(𝑓(𝑥),𝑔(𝑥))𝑑ℙ≤∫|(𝑓(𝑥),𝑔(𝑥))|𝑑ℙ≤𝐾𝜖,
where𝐾is the Lipschitz constant of . This implies that for any sequence 𝜖1,𝜖2,…we can
choose Lipschitz continuous functions 𝑓1,𝑓2,…with Lipschitz constants 𝐶1,𝐶2,…such that
∫(𝑓𝑛(𝑥),𝑦)𝑑𝜇𝑓< 𝜖𝑛. It remains to show that each of these functions are in fact knowledge
continuous. Since is a metric space, we consider the trivial metric decomposition of our sequence
of functions (see Remark 1). Specifically, we denote ℎ1=Idand proceed to bound 𝔼𝜎1
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦).

𝐾𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′), where𝐾is the Lipschitz constant of .
Proof.By Lipschitz continuity,
|(𝑥,𝑥′)−(𝑥,𝑥)|≤𝐾𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′),
|(𝑥,𝑥′)|≤𝐾𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′).
■
Lemma C.2. The set of all Lipschitz continuous functions from →separates all points in .
Proof.The identity function is 1-Lipschitz continuous and it also separates all points in .■
Corollary C.3. Let𝒞⊂be the set of all continuous functions from →andℒ⊂be the
set of all Lipschitz continuous functions from →. Ifis compact, then ℒis dense in𝒞with
respect to the uniform metric: 𝑑′(𝑓,𝑔)=sup𝑥∈𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑔(𝑥)).
Proof.This follows directly from Lem. C.2 and the Stone-Weierstrass theorem [65]. ■
Lemma C.4. Any compact metric space (,𝑑)is also bounded.
Proof.Bywayofcontrapositionsupposethat (,𝑑)isnotbounded. Then, sup𝑥,𝑥′∈𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′)=∞.
Pick𝑥1∈arbitrarily and pick 𝑥𝑛for𝑛∈ℤ+,𝑛>1such that𝑑(𝑥𝑛,𝑥1)>𝑛. Clearly, there does
not exist a convergent subsequence of the sequence 𝑥1,𝑥2,…. Thus,(,𝑑)cannot be compact. ■
D Proof of Equivalence Between Lipschitz Continuity and Knowledge

Proposition. (See Prop. 4.6) Suppose that (,𝑑),(,𝑑)are metric spaces. Let the first 𝑛metric
decompositionsof 𝑓∶→be𝐾𝑖-Lipschitzcontinuous,for 𝑖∈[𝑛]. If𝑓is𝜖-knowledgecontinuous
withrespecttothe 𝑛thhiddenlayerand 𝑑(𝑓(𝑥),𝑓(𝑥′))≤𝜂Δ(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑓(𝑥′,𝑦)forall𝑥,𝑥′∈,𝑦∈,
and some𝜂>0, then𝑓is Lipschitz continuous in expectation. That is,

23Eq. D.2 comes from the fact that we take the expectation only over pairs of points (𝑥,𝑦),(𝑥′,𝑦′)
where𝑦=𝑦′andalso becausethe summandisalways nonnegative. Then, weinductively applythe
definitionof 𝐾𝑖-Lipschitzcontinuityto yieldEq.D.3. Eq.D.4followsdirectly fromtheassumption

and this concludes the proof of the proposition. ■
To prove Cor. 4.7, we need the following auxiliary result from [89].
PropositionD.1 (See[89]).Foraneuralnetwork 𝑓∶ℝ𝑛→ℝ𝐾withLipschitzconstant 𝐿under

Here, margin (𝑓(𝑥))is the difference between the largest and second largeset output logit.
Corollary (See Cor. 4.7) .Suppose that assumptions of Prop. 4.6 are true. And also assume that
(,𝑑) = (ℝ𝑛,𝓁𝑝),(,𝑑) = (ℝ𝑚,𝓁𝑝), for1≤𝑝≤∞. Define a classifier from 𝑓∶ℝ𝑛→ℝ𝑚,
𝑔, where𝑔(𝑥)∶= argmax𝑘∈[𝑚]𝑓𝑘(𝑥)for any𝑥∈ℝ𝑛. Then, with probability 1−𝜖𝜂

𝑗=1𝐾𝑗. (D.8)
We yield the corollary by directly applying Prop. D.1 assuming that 𝑓is𝑡-Lipschitz continuous. ■
Next, we establish conditions under which Lipschitz continuity implies knowledge continuity.
Proposition (Prop. 4.8) .Let(,𝑑),(,𝑑)be a metric spaces. Let 𝑓∶→be𝜖-Lipschitz

𝑗=11
𝐾𝑗. (D.13)
Eq.D.11followsfrominductivelyapplyingthedefinitionofLipschitzcontinuityonthemetricdecom-
positions of 𝑓. Specifically, 𝑑𝑖+1(𝑓𝑖+1(𝑥),𝑓𝑖+1(𝑥′))≤𝐾𝑖𝑑𝑖(𝑓𝑖(𝑥),𝑓𝑖(𝑥)). Then, by the Lipschitz
continuity of in both coordinateswe yield Eq. D.12. Since the Lebesgueintegral preserves order,
Eq. D.13 directly implies the statement of the proposition and this concludes the proof. ■
E Predicting Adversarial Robustness with Volatility
In this section, we detail the experimental methods and results that use knowledge continuity to
predict adversarial vulnerability, briefly discussed in Section 5. We focus on langauge models of
varioussizesandtheirabilitytoperformsentimentclassificationontheIMDBdataset[ 48]. Before
computinganystatistics ofthemodel, wefinetuneitagainst theIMDBdatasetand reserveatestset
on which we compute a vulnerability score and estimate the model’s adversarial vulnerability.
Vulnerability Score. As described in the main text, given a model with 𝑛hidden layers, we compute
allofits𝑘-volatilityscores. ThisisdonewithanaiveMonto-Carloalgorithmwhichwepresentin
Appendix G. This results in a list of 𝑘-volatility scores {𝜖1,…,𝜖𝑛}, one for each hidden layer. Then,
we perform a simple average 𝑛−1∑𝑛
𝑘=1𝜖𝑘. Let us denote this quantity as the vulnarability score .
Estimating Adversarial Robustness. It remains to estimate the adversarial vulnerability of a
givenmodel. Wedothisempiricallybyapplyinganout-of-the-boxadversarialattack(specifically,
TextFooler[ 35])onthegivenmodelwithrespecttothereservedtestset. Wethenmeasurethenumber
of successful adversarial attacks defined as
♯Successful Adversarial Attacks =|adversarial∩correct)
|correct|,
where correctis the set of examples in the test set that are correctly classified by the model (after
finetuning) without any intervention. And, adversarialare the set of examples that are incorrectly
classified after an adversarial attack is applied. In other words, we only consider points where a
perturbation will worsenperformance. In expectation, this estimate of adversarial robustness should
bea1∕2factorofthenotionofvulnerabilitywepresentinThm.4.1,wherewealsoconsiderapointto
be vulnerable if perturbation increases its performance.
We then perform a linear regression using vulnerability score and a host of other model properties to
predict the number of successful adversarial attacks. Concretely, we seek to learn the relationship:
♯Successful Adversarial Attacks =𝑚𝑇(

where𝑚∈ℝ𝑑and𝑏∈ℝarethelearnableregressionparameters. Wealsoincorporate 𝑑−1sizeand

And so, the input variables to our regression and their types are:

Table2: Regressionresultsfromourthreepreviouslydescribedexperimentalsettings. Weregress
the number of successful adversarial attacks against (1) only the vulnerability score (2) vulnerability
score and model characteristics (3) only model characteristics. The coefficients for each of these
regressions results are shown in the column Coefficients . We also run permutation tests for each
coefficient and the change in 𝑅2is shown in the column Δ𝑅2(higher the better).
For the regression itself, we perform a Ridge regression with 𝛼= 1. We test three experimental
conditions where we regress the model’s adversarial robustness against: (1) only vulnerability score,
(2) vulnerability score and model characteristics, (3) only model characteristics. We experiment
with seven models: RoBERTa (Base/Large) [ 44],BERT-Uncased (Base/Large) [ 16],GPT2, and T5
(Small/Base) [58]. Our regression results are shown in Table. 2.
After yielding an initial line-of-best fit (see Fig. 2(a)), we run permutation tests to determine the
contribution of each feature to the explained variance. Specifically, for each feature, keeping all else
constant,wepermuteitsvalues. Ifthisfeatureisasignificantcontributortotheexplainedvariance,
intuitively, we should see a large decrease in 𝑅2after this intervention. If 𝑠is the𝑅2without any
intervention and 𝑠𝜎𝑖(𝑑)is the𝑅2after permuting the data by 𝜎𝑖(⋅)∶[𝑛]→[𝑛](for a dataset of 𝑛data
points). Then, we define
Δ𝑅2=𝑠−1
𝑁𝑁∑
𝑘=1𝑠𝜎𝑘(𝑑),
where𝑁controlsthenumberofpermutationsthatweapply. Forallexperimentswechoose 𝑁=100.
For formal theory on permutation tests, see [8].
We find that when our vulnerability score is added to the regression, it contributes significantly to
the explained variance. Moreover, in (2), we see that vulnerability score has the highest feature
importance among all regression variables.
F Localizing Volatile Hidden Representations
Inthissection,welocalizeadversariallyvulnerablehiddenrepresentationsintwoways. Firstly,we
use𝑘-volatility to gauge which layers are vulnerable across a selection of models. Then, we focus on
model-specificcharacterizationsofrobustnesswithrespectto 𝑘-volatility. Wepresentexperimentson
the same selection of models in Appendix E, the same dataset (IMDB [ 48]), and the same adversarial
attack (TextFooler [35]) to empirically measure adversarial vulnerability.
F.1 Layerwise Volatility
As mentioned in the previous section (Section E), for a given model with 𝑛hidden layers, we can
measure its 𝑘-volatility for 𝑘∈ [𝑛]through a Monte-Carlo algorithm. For each model, we then
plot its𝑘-volatility against its relative depth which is defined as ⌊𝑘∕𝑛⌋. These curves are shown
in Fig. 2(b). We see that models which have different architectures independent of size have very
different𝑘-volatility curves.
We have already shown in the previous section that there is a positive correlation between 𝑘-volatility
andadversarialvulnerability. However,thiscorrelationisderivedfromthesimpleaverageofall 𝑘-
volatilityscores. Arethe 𝑘-volatilityscoresinsomelayersmorepredictiveofadversarialvulnerability
26thanothers? Ifthe 𝑘-volatilityinsomelayersismorecorrelatedwith 𝑘-volatilityinothers,thenit
shouldsufficetominimize 𝑘-volatilityintheseformerlayers. Thiswouldalsospeedupregularization
and training.
Werepeattheexperimentsintheprevioussettings. But,insteadofcollating 𝑘-volatilitythrougha
simple average, we run one regression for each relative depth across all models (which we discretize
into 9 bins). This result is shown in Fig. 2(c). Surprisingly, we find that the magnitude of 𝑘-volatility
is not necessarily predictive of adversarial vulnerability. Forexample, inFig.2(b), almost all of the
modelsexhibitlowaverage 𝑘-volatilityinthelatterlayers. However,the 𝑘-volatilityoflatterlayers
predict adversarial vulnerability the best.
F.2 Model-Specific Volatility
We start by exploring the 𝑘-volatility across each of our test models. We notice that 𝑘-volatility
cannot be predicted by surface-level features such as size or model type alone. This is shown clearly
inFig.3. Yet,asdiscussedinAppendixE,itisstillabletopredictactualadversarialvulnerability
with moderate power. Thus, we conjecture that 𝑘-volatility captures a complex aspect of the model’s
vulnerability which cannot be solely attributed to its size or type.

G Regularizing Knowledge Continuity
In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of regulating knowledge continuity to achieve
robustness. Wefirstshowasimplealgorithmthatestimates 𝑘-volatility. Then,wedemonstratehow
this can incorporated into anyloss function as a regularization term. We then prove guarantees that
revolvearoundtheunbiasednessofourestimationalgorithm. Lastly,wepresentdetaileddiscussionof
the results shown in Table 1 including training details and ablation studies over the hyperparameters.
G.1 Estimating Knowledge Continuity Algorithmically
Wefirstpresentamethodforestimating 𝑘-volatility. ThisisshowninAlg.1( ESTKVOL). Intheory,

if𝑁 ≫1,thiscanbecomequicklyintractable. Inpractice,duringregularizationwekeep 𝑁tobe
thesameasifweweredoingnormalfinetuning(i.e. 32/64)andset 𝑀=𝑁. Thisworkswell,and,
anecdotally, we find that in contrast to contrastive learning increasing 𝑁or𝑀past this threshold
yields marginal returns. Further work could examine this relationship in more detail.
As discussed in the main text, the choice of metric (or representation space) which we enforce
knowledge continuity against is crucial as it determines the type of robustness we will achieve.
Therefore, in Alg. 1( KCREG), we incorporate this detail by sampling a hidden layer of interest using
a Beta distribution specified by hyperparameters 𝛼,𝛽. Then, on that minibatch, regularize 𝑘-volatility

with respect to that sampled layer. Note that we choose the Beta distribution for simplicity, however,
it can be replaced by any distribution like a mixture of Gaussians.
In contrast to existing adversarial trainingmethods such as [ 32] and [63] which only use the embed-
dings, our algorithm gives the practitioner more control over which hidden layer (or distance metric)

Moreover, for larger 𝜆, we find that the accuracy of the model is not compromised. This provides
some empirical support for Theorem 4.3.
G.2 Theoretical Guarantees of 𝑘-Volatility Estimation
In this subsection, we show that our Monte-Carlo algorithm presented in Alg. 1( ESTKVOL) is an
unbiased estimator. The proof is simple and follows from some bookkeeping.

space discussed in Section 4.4, or adapting the regularization weight based on some bootstrapped

as well as training speed.
G.3 Computer Vision Results
Inadditiontoregulatinglanguagemodels,wealsodemonstratethat KCREGiseffectiveforvision
tasks. This provides empirical support for the equivalences we proved in Section 4.5. The exact
same method of 𝑘-volatility estimation and loss augmentation is applied. We finetune threemodels
ResNet50 [ 28], MobileNetV2 [ 61], and ViT16 [ 17] on the MNIST dataset both with and without our
regularization algorithm. We then apply two different adversarial attacks: FGSM [ 24] and SI-NI-
FGSM [41]. We find that in both cases, regularization 𝑘-volatility improves/stabilizes robustness
across attack strengths (see Fig. 4).

in the accuracy (not under attack). This corroborates Theorem. 4.3, as it demonstrates that regulating
knowledge discontinuities (no matter how strongly) is not at odds with minimizing the empirical risk
ofourmodel. Ontheotherhand,wealsodonotseeasignificantincreaseinadversarialrobustness

The attack-strength is measured using the minimum angular similarity between the perturbed and

the TextFooler attack [35].

the strength of the adversarial attack. The adversarial attack strength is measured through the angular
similarity of the embeddings between the original text and the perturbed text. Intuitively, if this
constraint is loosened the adversary is allowed to find text that is semantically very different and vice
versa. We see that moderate 𝑘-volatility regulation achieves the best adversarial robustness across all
attack strengths.
Ablation Study of (𝛼,𝛽)In this subsection, we brieflydiscuss how the 𝛼,𝛽hyperparameters which
determine the shape of the Beta distribution in Alg. 1( KCREG) affect the final performance and
robustnessofourmodelontheIMDBdataset. RecallthattheshapeoftheBetadistributiondetermines
the index of the hidden layers we are using the compute the knowledge continuity. Thus, they are
crucial in determining the behavior of our regularizer.
We finetune {BERT, T5, GPT2} models on the IMDB dataset with the hyperparameters described in
the next subsection. The results are displayed in Table 3. Across all models we observe a decrease in
robustness for 𝛼=1,𝛽=2. These values correspond to a right-skewed distribution which places
high sampling probability on the earlier (closer to the input) hidden layers. Intuitively, perturbations
in the early layers should correspond to proportional textual perturbations in the input text. Pure
textualperturbationswithrespecttosomemetricliketheLevenshteindistanceshouldbeonlyloosely

this sort of knowledge continuity in the earlier layers is harder to converge on and there may be a

G.5 Training Details
In this section, we describe in detail the training objectives, procedures, algorithms, and hyperparme-
ters that we used in the main text and further experiments done in the appendix.
Brute-Force Adversarial Training. For all models undergoing adversarial training, we first finetune
the model against the training set. Then, attack it using the TextFooler [ 35] algorithm with examples
from the training set. After the attacks are concluded, we then incorporate the text of successful
adversarial attacks back into the training set and proceed to finetune again. This procedure iteratively
continues. Forthesakeofcomputationalefficiency,forallmodelsweappliedthisprocedureonce.
Theparametersweareusingduringtheadversarialattackisthesamehyperparametersweactually
use at test-time. Specifically, we impose a query budget of 300 queries.
Plain Finetuning on IMDB. The IMDB dataset consist of 50,000 examples with 25,000 for training
and 25,000 for testing. We split the test set 40%-60% to create a validation and test set of 10,000
and 15,000 examples, respectively. Examples were sampled uniformly at random during the splitting
process. Sinceadversarialattackswerecostly,weuniformlysubsampled5,000examplesfromthis
15,000 to benchmark robustness in the experiments related to the regularizer. However, for the

15,000datapointsinthetestset. Wefoundnosignificantdifferencebetweenrobustnessestimationon
this 5,000 subsample versus and the entire 15,000 dataset.
We train all models using the hyperparameter and optimizer configurations shown in Table 4.
31Knowledge Discontinuity Regulation on IMDB. To enforce the knowledge discontinuity on IMDB,
weuseaconstant 𝜆=1×10−2forallmodels. AsshowninTable3, wevaried 𝛼,𝛽∈{1,2}×{1,2}
and displayed the best models in terms of robustness in Table. 1 in the main text. We train all models
for 50 epochs. Other than that all the other hyperparameters and optimizer configurations are the
same as regular finetuning (see Table 4).

is, for T5:𝛼=2,𝛽=1; BERT-Base-Uncased: 𝛼=2,𝛽=1; GPT2:𝛼=2,𝛽=2.
ALUM on IMDB and ANLI. We train all ALUM models for 50 epochs (the same as knowledge
discontinuity regularized models). For hyperpararmeters specific to the ALUM algorithm we choose
all of the same ones as its authors, [ 43], with the exception of 𝛼(analogous to the 𝜆in our algorithm,
essentiallytheweightputonthevirtualadversarialtraininglossterm). Theauthorsoftheoriginal
paper choose 𝛼=10. We, however, found that this applied to finetuning does not converge at all.
Thus, with a rough grid search in the parameter space we found 𝛼=1×10−3to be the best with
respect to both performance and robustness.
We keep the same hyperparameters on ANLI, however, we impose early stopping during the training
process. That is, we choose the best model with respect to its performance on the devset.
H Certifying Robustness at Test-Time
Herein, we present a certification algorithm using Thm. 4.1 and our Monte-Carlo estimate of 𝑘-
volatility1( ESTKVOL). Ouralgorithm(showninAlg.2)isbasedontheworkof[ 12]. Weupperbound
the𝑘-volatility by bootstrapping a 1−𝛼confidence interval. Then, directly apply Thm. 4.1 using
the 0-1 loss function. Thus, Cor. H.1 follows. We emphasize here that this certification algorithm
may not be directlyinformative, especially in the discrete/non-metrizable setting, unless we have an
inversemap fromtherepresentationspaceback totheinputspace. Thisis discussedfurtherin[ 82].
Nonetheless,itcanbeusedasamethodtoverifywhetherornotcertaininterventiontechniquesare

2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present a detailed discussion of the limitations in Section K.
Guidelines:
•TheanswerNAmeansthatthepaper hasnolimitationwhilethe answerNomeansthatthepaper
has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
•The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•Thepapershouldpointoutanystrongassumptionsandhowrobusttheresultsaretoviolationsof
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
imagesaretakeninlowlighting. Oraspeech-to-textsystemmightnotbeusedreliablytoprovide

•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
•Ifapplicable,theauthorsshoulddiscusspossiblelimitationsoftheirapproachtoaddressproblems
of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
thatindividual actionsinfavor oftransparencyplay animportantrole indevelopingnorms that

include full proofs of each theoretical resultin Appendices A, B,C, G. To thebest of our knowledge,
the proofs are correct.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.

Question: Doesthepaperfullydisclosealltheinformationneededtoreproducethemainexperimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present all of the hyperparameters in the experiments that require training in Ap-
pendix G. Additionally, our compute resources are detailed in Appendix J.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Dependingonthecontribution,reproducibilitycanbeaccomplishedinvariousways. Forexample,
if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the
contributionisaspecificmodelandempiricalevaluation,itmaybenecessarytoeithermakeit
possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model.
In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility
can also be providedvia detailed instructions for how toreplicate the results, access to a hosted
model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other
means that are appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
toprovidesomereasonableavenueforreproducibility,whichmaydependonthenatureofthe
contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcometodescribetheparticularwaytheyprovideforreproducibility. Inthecaseofclosed-
