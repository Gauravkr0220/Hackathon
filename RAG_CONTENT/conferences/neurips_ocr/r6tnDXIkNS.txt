Abstract
It is vital to infer a signed distance function (SDF) in multi-view based surface
reconstruction. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) provides a novel perspective for
volume rendering, and shows advantages in rendering efficiency and quality. Al-
though 3DGS provides a promising neural rendering option, it is still hard to infer
SDFs for surface reconstruction with 3DGS due to the discreteness, the sparseness,
and the off-surface drift of 3D Gaussians. To resolve these issues, we propose
a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the learning of neural SDFs. Our
key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF inference with the multi-view
consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set
of the neural SDF using neural pulling, and then render the aligned 3D Gaussians
through the differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by
pulling neighboring space to the pulled 3D Gaussians, which progressively refine
the signed distance field near the surface. With both differentiable pulling and
splatting, we jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB
and geometry constraints, which recovers more accurate, smooth, and complete
surfaces with more geometry details. Our numerical and visual comparisons show
our superiority over the state-of-the-art results on the widely used benchmarks.

1 Introduction
3D scene representations are important to various computer vision applications, such as single or
multi-view 3D reconstruction [ 39,42,67,72], novel view synthesis [ 1,71], and neural SLAM [ 22,
32,78,24] etc.. Mesh and point clouds are the most common 3D scene representations, and can be
rendered by fast rasterization on GPUs. Instead, more recent neural radiance fields (NeRFs) [ 49] are
continuous scene representations, but it is slow to render NeRFs due to the need of costly stochastic
sampling along rays in volume rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussians with different attributes like
color and opacity are used as a versatile differentiable volumetric representation [ 30,77,23] for
neural rendering through splatting, dubbed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). It prompts the pros of
both NeRFs and point based representations, which achieves both better quality and faster speed in
rendering. Although 3D Gaussians can render plausible images, it is still a challenge to reconstruct
surfaces based on the 3D Gaussians.
The key challenge comes from the gap between the discrete 3D Gaussians and the continuous
geometry representations, such as implicit functions. Besides the discreteness, the sparseness
caused by uneven distribution and the off-surface drift make 3D Gaussians even harder to use than

branch [ 44,66,11], use monocular depth and normal images as priors to bypass the messy and
unordered 3D Gaussians [ 14,57], or use surface-aligned Gaussians [ 25,68,14] in rasterization to
approximate surfaces. However, how to learn continuous implicit representations to recover more
accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with sharp geometry details is still an open question.
To answer this question, we introduce a novel method to infer neural SDFs from multi-view RGB
images through 3D Gaussian splatting. We progressively infer a signed distance field by training a
neural network along with learning 3D Gaussians to minimize rendering errors through splatting. To
more effectively constrain the surface inference with the multi-view consistency, we dynamically
align 3D Gaussians with the zero-level set of the neural SDF, and render the aligned 3D Gaussians
on the zero-level set by differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by
pulling the neighboring space onto the disk determined by each 3D Gaussian on the zero-level set,
which gradually refines the signed distance field near the surface. The capability of seamlessly
merging neural SDFs with 3DGS not only get rid of the dependence of costly NeRFs like stochastic
sampling on rays but also enables us to access the field attributes like signed distances and gradients
during the splatting process, which provides a novel perspective and a versatile platform for surface
reconstruction with 3DGS. The key to the 3D Gaussian alignment and neural SDF inference is a
differentiable pulling operation which uses the predicted signed distances and gradients from the
neural SDF. It provides a way of imposing geometry based constraints on 3D Gaussians besides
the RGB based constraints through splatting. Our numerical and visual evaluations on widely used
benchmarks show our superiority over the latest methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and
recovered geometry details. Our contributions are listed below,
•We propose to infer neural SDF through splatting 3D Gaussians pulled on the zero-level
set, which can more effectively constrain surface inference with the multi-view consistency.
This enables to recover more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with geometry details.
•We introduce to dynamically align 3D Gaussians to the zero-level set and update the
neural SDF through a differentiable pulling operation. To this end, we propose novel loss
terms and training strategies to work with the discrete and sparse 3D Gaussians in surface
reconstruction.
•We achieve the state-of-the-art numerical and visual results in multi-view based surface
reconstruction.
2 Related Work
Neural implicit representations have achieved remarkable progress in reconstructing 3D geometry
with details [ 53,48,13,45,7,21]. Neural implicit functions can be learned by either 3D supervisions,
such as signed distances [ 53,13,41] and binary occupancy labels [ 48], or 2D supervisions, such
as multi-view RGB images [ 60] and normal images [ 5]. In the following, we focus on reviewing
methods of learning implicit representations from 2D and 3D supervisions separately. Then we
provide a detailed discussion on the latest reconstruction methods based on 3D Gaussians.
2.1 Learning Implicit Representation from Multi-view Images
Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) [ 49] have become an essential technology for representing 3D scene
through multi-view images. Many of its applications have been explored, resulting in significant
advancements in areas such as acceleration [ 50,12], dynamic scene [ 16,4] and sparse rendering [ 58,
26]. Besides these applications, extracting accurate surfaces from NeRFs remains a challenge.
Mainstream approaches typically design various differentiable formulas to transform the density in
radiance fields into implicit representations for volume rendering, such as signed distance function
(SDF) [ 60,39,54], unsigned distance function (UDF) [ 42,47,15,70] and occupancy [ 52]. With
the learned implicit function fields, post-processing algorithms [ 43,21,48] are applied to extract
the zero level set to obtain the reconstructed meshes. Following methods introduce different priors
from SfM [ 18,69] or large-scale datasets [ 67,59,40] to improve the reconstruction performance in
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches focus on speeding up the neural rendering procedure, aiming
to achieve high-quality meshes and rendering views within a short period of training time. They
2propose alternative data structures to replace the heavy MLP framework used in original NeRF, such
as sparse voxel grid [ 17], multi-resolution hash grid [ 50,61] and radial basis function [ 12], or design
subtle differentiable rasterization pipelines to achieve real-time rendering [ 64,56]. However, these
methods still face the trade-off between rendering quality and training speed.
2.2 Learning Implicit Representation from Point Clouds
Since DeepSDF [ 53] and OccNet [ 48] were proposed, learning implicit representation from point
clouds has achieved remarkable results in geometry modeling. These methods use ground truth signed
distances and binary occupancy labels calculated from ground truth point clouds as supervisions to
learn the implicit representation of shapes. The supervisions can serve as different kinds of global
priors [ 3,42,55,36] and local priors [ 62,28,38,6], which enables the neural implicit function
to better capture geometry details and generalize to unseen shapes during inference. Some other
methods infer SDFs without 3D supervisions. They train neural networks to overfit on single point
clouds. These methods introduce additional constraints [ 19,76], novel ways of using gradients [ 45,
74,51,35,75], specially designed priors [ 46,10,9] and normals [ 2,37,34] to estimate signed or
unsigned distances and occupancy, which use point clouds as a reference.
2.3 Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussians
3D Gaussian Splatting [ 30] has become a new paradigm in neural rendering due to its fast rendering
speed, intuitive explicit representation and outstanding rendering performance. However, reconstruct-
ing accurate surfaces from 3D Gaussian remains a challenge due to the messy, noisy, and unevenly
distributed 3D Gaussians. To solve this problem, one kind of approaches involves combining 3D
Gaussians with neural implicit surface functions [ 60,50] to enhance the performance of both branches,
which employs mutual supervisions between the two components [ 66,11,44]. Another kind of ap-
proaches encourage the reduction from 3D Gaussians to 2D Gaussians with a series of regularization
terms, which ensures the Gaussian primitives to align with the object surfaces [ 25,20,14]. Addi-
tionally, some methods introduce additional priors from large-scale datasets [ 57,14] or multi-view
stereo [ 63], or use elaborately designed surface extraction algorithms [ 68,65] to recover 3D geometry
from 3D Gaussians. Although these efforts have achieved improved reconstructions, they are still
limited in capturing fine-grained geometry and lack the precise perception of continuous implicit
representations. Different from all these mentioned methods, we propose to seamlessly combine
3D Gaussians with the learning of neural SDFs. Our method provides a novel perspective to jointly
learn 3D Gaussians and neural SDFs by more effectively using multi-view consistency and imposing
geometry constraints.
3 Method
Overview. We aim to infer a neural SDF ffrom posed multi-view RGB images {vi}I
i=1, as shown
in Fig. 1. We learn 3D Gaussian functions {gj}J
j=1with their attributes like color, opacity, and shape
to represent the geometry and color in the 3D scene. Meanwhile, when learning the 3D Gaussians,
we introduce novel constraints to infer the continuous surfaces with the neural SDF. We rely on a
differentiable pulling operation and the differentiable rasterization to bridge the gap between the
discrete Gaussians and the continuous neural SDF, align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set of the
neural SDF, and back propagate the supervision signals from both the rendering errors and other
geometry constraints to jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF.
Neural Signed Distance Function. We leverage an SDF fto represent the geometry of a scene.
An SDF fis an implicit function that can predict a signed distance sat an arbitrary location q,
i.e.,s=f(q). Recent methods usually train a neural network to approximate an SDF from signed
distance supervision or infer an SDF from 3D point clouds or multi-view images. A level set is an
iso-surface formed by the points with the same signed distance values. The zero-level set is a special
level set, which is formed by points with a signed distance of 0. We can use the marching cubes
algorithm [ 43] to extract the zero-level set a a mesh surface. Another character of the zero-level set is
that the gradient of the SDF fat query qon the zero-level set, i.e., ∇f(q), is the normal of q.
3D Gaussian Splatting. 3D Gaussians have become a vital differentiable volume representation for
scene modeling. We can learn a set of 3D Gaussians {gj}J

from the j-th 3D Gaussian is pj(q) =exp(−0.5∗(q−µj)TPPP−1(q−µj)), where µjis the center
of the j-th Gaussian, andPPPis the covariance matrix.
We can learn these 3D Gaussian functions through a differentiable rasterization. We render 3D Gaus-
sians{gj}into rendered RGB images v′
i, and then, optimize the learnable attributes by minimizing
the rendering errors to the ground truth observations vi, where C′(u, v)andC(u, v)are the rendered
and the GT color values at pixel (u, v), i.e., min{gj}||C′(u, v)−C(u, v)||2
2.
Aligning 3D Gaussians with the Zero-level Set. Since 3D Gaussian splatting is so flexible in
volume rendering, it does not require 3D Gaussians to locate on the geometry surface for good
rendering quality. While we expect 3D Gaussians to locate on geometry surface, so that we can more
effectively leverage them and multi-view consistency as clues to infer more accurate neural SDFs
for reconstruction. To this end, we introduce a differentiable pulling operation to pull 3D Gaussians
on the zero-level set of the neural SDF f, and then, we render the pulled 3D Gaussians through the
splatting.
Specifically, inspired by Neural-Pull [ 45], we rely on the gradient field of the neural SDF fduring
the pulling operation. We move each one of the 3D Gaussians gjusing the predicted signed distance
sj=f(µj)and the gradient ∇f(µj), where µjis the mean value of the 3D Gaussian. As shown in
Fig. 1 (a), this pulling operation will turn the 3D Gaussian gjinto a 3D Gaussian g′
jthat get projected
onto the zero-level set of SDF f, where g′
jshares the same attributes with gjbut has a different center

Signed Distance Inference with Pulled 3D Gaussians. We infer signed distances in the field with
pulled 3D Gaussians {g′
j}. Pulled 3D Gaussians provide a coarse estimation of the surface, which
we can use as a reference. One challenge here is that the sparsity and non-uniformly distributed
3D Gaussians do not show a clear geometry clue for surface inference. Although previous methods
like NeuralTPS [ 8] and OnSurfPrior [ 46] manage to learn continuous implicit functions from sparse
points, it is still difficult to recover surfaces from both sparse and non-uniformly distributed points.
4To overcome this challenge, we introduce an approach to estimate neural SDFs from sparse 3D
Gaussians. Like Neural-Pull [ 45], we still use a differentiable pulling operation to pull neighboring
space onto the surface but we regard the disk established by the shape of a 3D Gaussian as a pulling
target, rather than a point, as shown in Fig. 2, which aims for a larger target on surfaces. To this
end, we impose constraints not only on the shape of 3D Gaussians but also on the pulling operation.
Specifically, we introduce three constraints. The first one constrains 3D Gaussians to be a thin disk.
The second constraint encourages the thin disk to be a tangent plane on the zero-level set. The third
constraint pushes queries to get pulled onto the thin disk along the normal of the Gaussian.
The first constraint adds penalties if the smallest variance among the three variances of a 3D Gaussian
gjis too large, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). Thus, the loss for a thin disk Gaussian is listed below,
LThin =∥min{r1, r2, r3}∥1, (3)
where r1,r2, andr3are variances along the three axes. Flattening a 3D Gaussian ellipsoid into a disk
was first introduced in NeuSG [ 11] and has become a consensus in recent Gaussian reconstruction
works [ 25,14]. The motivation is that 2D planar disk primitives are more suitable for surface
representation, making it easier to apply alignment constraints. Additionally, we can naturally use the
direction pointing along the axis with the minimum variance ¯r= min {r1, r2, r3}to represent the
normal njof the Gaussian gj.
Based on the thin disk shape of Gaussians, the second constraint encourages the pulled Gaussians
{g′
j}to be the tangent plane on the zero-level set, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). What we do is to align
the normal njof a Gaussian gjwith the normal at the center µ′
jof the pulled Gaussian g′
jon the
zero-level set. We use the gradient ∇f(µ′
j)of the neural SDF at µ′
jas the expected normal here.
Hence, we align the normal njof a Gaussian with the normal ∇f(µ′
j)on the zero-level set,

Figure 2: Comparison of pulling Gaussians to centers
and to disks. The former tends to overfit sparse Gaussian
centers, resulting in incomplete meshes. We address
this issue by pulling queries onto disk planes.With the disk-like Gaussians located on the
tangent plane, we introduce to sense the
signed distance field by pulling randomly
sampled queries on the Gaussian disks, as
shown in Fig. 1 (b). Turning the pulling
target from a point [ 45,8] into a plane is
based on the observation that the 3D Gaus-
sian function with a boundary can cover
the surface more completely although their
centers {µ1, ..., µ j}which are sparse and
non-uniformly distributed. Thus, we ex-
pect the operation can pull a query onto a
Gaussian disk plane. Fig. 2 demonstrates
the improvement of pulling queries onto
their nearest Gaussian disk planes over the
nearest Gaussian centers. The comparisons
show that pulling onto the disk plane can
improve the robustness to the sparsity and
non-uniformly Gaussian distribution. With learned Gaussian centers, pulling queries to centers can
not recover the smooth and continuous geometry in areas where almost no Gaussian centers appear.
While pulling queries to the Gaussian disk plane can recover more accurate and complete surfaces
since the disk established by the learned variance of Gaussian functions can mostly cover the gap.
Specifically, at a query q, we pull it onto the zero-level set using a similar way in Eq. 2, i.e.,
q′=q−s∗ ∇f(q)/|∇f(q)|. To encourage the query to get pulled onto the nearest pulled Gaussian
disk, we maximize its probability of belonging to its nearest pulled Gaussian ¯gwhich is determined
in terms of the distance between qand the Gaussian center ¯µ,

We minimize the negative logarithm of the probability in our implementation. Moreover, we expect
the pulling can follow a direction orthogonal to the disk plane, which leads to the minimum moving
distance conform to the definition of signed distances. To this end, we impose another constraint on
the gradient to ensure that the pulling can follow a path with the minimum distance to the nearest
pulled Gaussian disk, as shown in Fig. 1 (e),
LOthorgnal = 1−∇f(q)

where the constraint aligns the gradient at query qand the normal ¯njof the pulled Gaussian disk ¯g.
Rendering. We also render the pulled Gaussians {g′
j}into images through splatting to add penalties
on rendering errors, where {g′
j}are Gaussians pulled onto the zero-level set from the Gaussians {gj}
by the neural SDF fin Eq. 2. Each pair of gjandg′

Implementation Details. Our code is build upon the source code released by 3DGS [ 30]. Similar
to [68], we make some changes to 3DGS’s densification strategy. The first one is to initialize the
newly cloned Gaussians around the original Gaussians rather than at the same positions. The second
one is to encourage 3DGS to split larger Gaussians into smaller ones more frequently. These strategies
aim to increase the number of primitives and to avoid underfitting in textureless areas. Regularization
parameters are set to α=100, β=0.1, γ=1,δ=0.1. We optimize our model for a total of 15k iterations.
We stop densification and incorporate the pulling and constraints at 7k iterations. The SDF network is
implemented as an MLP with 8 layers, 256 hidden units and ReLU activation function, and initialized
as a sphere, following [ 45]. The parameters of the SDF network shares the same optimizer as that of
3D Gaussians. All the experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

Evaluation Metrics and Datasets. We evaluate the performance of our method on widely adopted
datasets including both object-level and large-scale ones, including DTU [ 27], Tanks and Temples
(TNT) [ 31] and Mip-NeRF 360 (M360) [ 1]. To evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed meshes,
we use Chamfer Distance (CD) on DTU and F-score on TNT, using the official evaluation script. To
evaluate the rendering quality in real-scene datasets, we report PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS in evaluations

the rendering quality with state-of-the-art neural rendering methods, including Instant-NGP [ 50],
Mip-NeRF 360 [1] and BakedSDF [64].

specially designed algorithms and take a long time for extracting surfaces, we adopt the marching
cubes algorithm [ 43] to extract mesh surfaces with the learned neural SDF f. For small scale scenes,
we use a resolution of 800 to extract surfaces, while we split large scale scenes into parts, each
of which gets reconstructed with a resolution of 800 to bypass the limitation of our computational
resources.
4.2 Comparisons
Comparisons on DTU. We report accuracy of reconstructed meshes and training time against
baselines on DTU dataset in Tab. 1. Our method outperforms all Gaussian-based reconstruction
methods in terms of Chamfer Distance. Our method achieves comparable training time to the state-
of-the-art Gaussian-reconstruction method 2DGS [ 25] but gains better reconstruction accuracy than
2DGS. The visualization results in Fig. 3 highlight the advantages of our method. By employing
alignment constraints and pulling operations between the 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF field, we
can reconstruct significantly smoother and more complete surfaces than the baselines.
Comparisons on TNT. We further evaluate our method using more challenging large-scale unbounded
scenes on TNT dataset. Numerical comparisons in Tab. 2 show that we achieve higher F-score
compared to baseline methods, even surpassing NeuS, which however takes about 12 hours to fit a
scene. Notably, as the scene scale increases, the number of Gaussian primitives increases rapidly,
causing the adjusted CUDA rasterization kernel of 2DGS to consume more time for rendering.
In contrast, since our rasterization kernel is based on 3DGS, it is less sensitive to the number of
Gaussians, which enables us to learn 3D Gaussians faster than 2DGS. We provide visual comparisons

sis methods indicate that

pose effective geometric
constraints without compro-
mising rendering quality. This provides a promising solution for learning continuous distance fields
from discrete 3D Gaussians. Visual comparisons of mesh reconstructions are shown in Fig. 5, which
demonstrate that our method is able to recover more smooth and complete surface by more effectively
using the multi-view consistency.

In this section, we conduct ablation studies on the key techniques of our method to demonstrate their
effectiveness. The full quantitative results are reported in Tab. 4, which are conducted on all scenes in
DTU dataset [27].

(d) Comparisons of different mesh extraction methods.Pulling Operations. We first examine
the effect of pulling Gaussians onto the
zero-level set, as reported in Tab. 4 ("w/o
Pull Gaussians" vs. "Ours"). The original
3DGS tends to produce floating ellipsoids
near the object surfaces to overfit the train-
ing views. By pulling the Gaussians to the
zero-level set of the SDF field, the Gaus-
sians are consistently distributed on the sur-
face. As shown in Fig. 6a, after getting
pulled onto the zero-level set, the Gaussian
centers are distributed on a thin layer of
the object surface, thus achieving an ac-
curate geometry estimation. Meanwhile,
we pull neighboring space onto Gaussian
disks to learn neural SDFs. Comparing to
NeuralPull [ 45] which pulls query points to
centers, we innovatively pull query points
to Gaussian disks, which bridge the gap
between continuous SDF field and sparse
Gaussian distributions, as highlighted in
Fig. 2 and Tab. 4 (“Pulled to centers” vs.
“Ours”).
Constraint Terms. We further explore the
effect of our constraint terms, as reported
in Tab. 4 (“Constraint Terms”). Our full
model provides the best performance when
applying all constraint terms. The orthog-
onal loss helps to learn a more regularized
SDF field, while the thin loss and tangent
loss provide constraints to align the orienta-
tion of Gaussian disks with the gradient of
neural SDF on the zero-level sets, resulting
in a good normal field and a reconstructed
mesh, as shown in Fig. 6b, 6c.
Mesh Extraction. We also report the re-
construction accuracy using TSDF fusion
and screened Poisson reconstruction [ 29], as shown in Fig. 6d and Tab. 4 (“Mesh Extractions”).
For TSDF fusion, we render depth maps and fuse them using a voxel size of 0.004 and truncation
threshold as 0.02, the same as 2DGS [ 25]. For screened Poisson, we use the Gaussian centers and
normals as input. Unlike 2DGS [ 25] and GSurfels [ 14] which incorporate rendered depth into the
differentiable rasterization pipeline, we do not directly optimize depths, resulting in noisy depth maps
and unsatisfactory reconstruction results. However, since the positions and normals of the Gaussians
are well optimized through our approach, screened Poisson reconstruction can achieve relatively
good results.
9w/o Eikonal loss w/ Eikonal loss
Figure 7: Visualization of the effect of eikonal loss.Gradient Constraint. We follow Neural-
Pull [ 45] to use normalized SDF gradient for
pulling operation. We report the result with an
additional Eikonal term [ 19] to explicitly con-
strain the gradient length, as shown in Fig. 7.
The result is significantly degenerated because
that Neural-Pull depends on both predicted SDF
values and gradient directions to optimize the
SDF field. It makes the optimization even more
complex when adding additional constraint on
the gradient length.
5 Conclusion
We propose a method to learn neural SDFs for multi-view surface reconstruction with 3D Gaussian
splatting. Our results show that we can more effectively leverage multi-view consistency to recover
more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with geometry details by rendering 3D Gaussians
pulled on the zero-level set. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians to the zero-level set and
update neural SDFs through both differentiable pulling and splatting for both RGB and geometry
constraints. Our methods successfully refine the signed distance field near the surface in a progressive
manner, leading to plausible surface reconstruction. Our ablation studies justify the effectiveness of
our novel modules, loss terms, and training strategies. Our evaluations show our superiority over the
latest methods in terms of accuracy, completeness, and smoothness.

A.1 Background Reconstruction

Figure 8: Visualization of reconstructed backgrounds.
Since our SDF field was learned by fitting Gaussian ellipsoids, it can infer implicit surfaces at
any location where Gaussians are distributed. Therefore, our method has the same capability to
reconstruct backgrounds as methods like TSDF fusion, as shown in Fig. 8. Current works generally
utilize screened Poisson or TSDF fusion to reconstruct meshes [ 25,20] and tend to reconstruct
large sky spheres in the background. Our method learns neural SDFs and utilize marching cubes to
reconstruct mesh, which avoid such bad cases.

Figure 9: Visualization of loss and gra-
dient between Pulling to centers and
Pulling to disks with the distance of a
query point to the Gaussian center.We provide a theoretical analysis here to demonstrate
the advantage of pulling queries onto disks compared to
pulling queries onto centers. We provide a visual compari-
son of the two strategies in Fig. 9, showcasing the changes
of the loss function and the loss gradients as the query
point approaches the Gaussian center. As the query point
gets closer to the Gaussian center, the loss function of
“pulling to centers” decays at a constant rate, and the gra-
dient of the loss remains constant. In contrast, for “pulling
to disks”, the loss function decreases quadratically, and
the gradient of the loss gradually diminishes. This means
that under the influence of the disk loss, as the query point
approximates the center, the received gradient becomes
smaller, reducing the driving force that pushes the query
point towards the center. In other words, the disk loss has
a higher “tolerance” for the query point not being pulled
to the center. This explains why we can learn a continu-
ous field from a sparse and non-uniformity distribution of
Gaussian ellipsoids using the disk loss, whereas the center loss would lead to the SDF field overfitting
to every Gaussian center.
A.3 Limitations & Future Works
Reconstructed mesh Reference Image
Figure 10: Failure case. This is because the SDF
network cannot accurately capture high-frequency
details due to the smooth characteristic of MLPs.While our method successfully recovers accu-
rate appearance and geometry reconstruction for
a wide range of objects and scenes, it also has
several limitations. Firstly, the neural SDF is
seamlessly integrated with Gaussian ellipsoids,
making it difficult to avoid the inherent draw-
backs of original 3D Gaussians, such as the lack
of transparent objects and areas with strong spec-
ular reflections. Secondly, although we address
the issue of learning a continuous SDF field
from sparse and non-uniformly distributed Gaus-
sian ellipsoids by pulling query points to disks,
16our method shows limited performance in ex-
tremely sparse areas. In very distant regions of unbounded scenes or areas with colors similar to the
background color, where 3DGS reconstructs no ellipsoids or only a few ellipsoids, our method tends
to produce holes. Thirdly, due to the continuous and smooth characteristics of MLPs, our SDF tends
to capture the low-frequency features of objects, making it difficult to reconstruct high-frequency
details. A failure case is shown in Figure. 10, where we can reconstruct the very smooth tablecloth but
fail to recover the details of the lego. There are two potential solutions for this issue in the future: one
is to enhance the representation capability of the SDF by integrated with latest implicit representation
learning methods, such as BACON [ 41] and GridPull [ 7]; the other one is to dig into the capabilities
of TSDF fusion and screened Poisson in reconstructing our SDF field, which have the ability to
reconstruct arbitrary resolution details.
A.4 More Results
We provide additional reconstruction results in Fig. 11, 12, 13, which further justifies the superiority
of our method. We notice that there are some holes on the flowerbed area in Fig. 13. This is due
to the overly complex geometric structures and a lack of view covering, thus emitting a significant
under-fitting issue. This results in a set of extremely sparse, huge, and unevenly distributed Gaussians,
which makes Gaussians are thick ellipsoid like shape rather than relatively thin plans, leading to poor
sense of surface. Although these huge Gaussians may work well in rendering, but they cannot recover
any geometry covered by them. How to control the size of Gaussians for SDF inference could be an
interesting future work direction.
We also visualize the error maps on meshes obtained by 2DGS and ours in Fig. 14, which highlights
our superiority in terms of the accuracy of extracted surfaces. The surfaces learned by 2DGS are
usually fat and a little bit drift away from ground truth surfaces, although their meshes seem to show
more details. Our method is able to capture more accurate surfaces by using 3D Gaussians pulled
onto the zero-level set and pulling query points onto Gaussian disks at the same time, leading to much
more accurate zero-level set.

A.5 Discussion
Learning SDF Learning UDF
Figure 15: Visualization of surfaces reconstructed by SDF
and UDF.About open surfaces. Since there are
lots of non-closed surfaces in large-
scale scenes, a natural solution is to
learn an unsigned distance field to re-
construct open structures [ 70,73,33].
However, extracting the zero-level set
from UDF as a mesh surface is still
a challenge, resulting in artifacts and
outliers on the reconstructed meshes.
We report the result of learning UDFs
instead SDFs in Fig. 15, which shows
the shortcomings of UDF learning. To
avoid the influence of double-layer
surfaces on evaluation accuracy under the SDF settings, we practically delete the back faces according
to the visibility of each face under each camera view. Through this way, we can accurately reconstruct
open structures with single-layer surfaces.
18NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations and failure cases in the Appendix A.3.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
19Justification: We discussed why pulling queries onto disks is better than pulling queries onto
centers in the appendix. There is no theoretical theorems or lemmas in it, but We tried our
best to give a theoretical analysis for this discussion.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the detailed information in reproducing our methods in Section 3
of the main paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
20Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide our demonstration code as a part of our supplementary materials.
We will release the source code, data and instructions upon acceptance.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the training and testing details in the experiment section (Section
4).
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We report the average performance as the experimental results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
21•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report our training time with baseline methods in the experiment part.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the applications and potential impacts of our method in the
introduction.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
22•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use the open-sourced datasets and codes under their licenses.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
23•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
