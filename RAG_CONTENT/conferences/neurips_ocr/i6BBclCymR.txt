Abstract
Novel view synthesis under sparse views has been a long-term important challenge
in 3D reconstruction. Existing works mainly rely on introducing external semantic
or depth priors to supervise the optimization of 3D representations. However, the
diffusion model, as an external prior that can directly provide visual supervision, has
always underperformed in sparse-view 3D reconstruction using Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) due to the low information entropy of sparse views compared to
text, leading to optimization challenges caused by mode deviation. To this end,
we present a thorough analysis of SDS from the mode-seeking perspective and
propose Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which leverages visual inline
priors provided by pose relationships between viewpoints to rectify the rendered
image distribution and decomposes the original optimization objective of SDS,
thereby offering effective diffusion visual guidance without any fine-tuning or
pre-training. Furthermore, we propose the IPSM-Gaussian pipeline, which adopts
3D Gaussian Splatting as the backbone and supplements depth and geometry
consistency regularization based on IPSM to further improve inline priors and
rectified distribution. Experimental results on different public datasets show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. The code is released at

1 Introduction
Novel View Synthesis (NVS) [ 1,2],e.g.Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [ 1,3,4] and recently emerged
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [ 2,5,6], requires dense training viewpoints for optimization, as
demonstrated in prevailing works [ 7–9]. Indeed, NVS under sparse views has been an important and
challenging task [ 10,11,7]. Due to the scarcity of viewpoints, most methods of 3D representation
reconstruction often fall into over-fitting with sparse views, and cannot synthesize satisfactory novel
views [ 9,8,12]. To address the optimization over-fitting problem under the sparse-view condition,
current methods introduce external priors to supervise the optimization of reconstruction like CLIP
[13] semantic information [ 7], monocular depth [ 11,9], and diffusion visual priors [ 14–16]. However,
although the diffusion model [ 17–21] as an external prior can provide stronger visual supervision than
semantic and depth information, it often requires a significant amount of computational resources for
fine-tuning the diffusion prior [16] orpre-training encoders [15] with external data. A few works
have no fine-tuning and pre-training, but it is difficult to straightly extract diffusion prior knowledge
to effectively supplement the missing visual information of sparse views [14].
Interestingly, although the diffusion model shows great potential in 3D generation tasks, e.g.text-to-3D
[23], which benefit from the recent rapid development of score distillation techniques [ 23–26], Score
Distillation Sampling (SDS) [ 23] shows little visual information guidance ability of the diffusion
prior under sparse views and even takes an inhibitory effect on the baseline performance when the

input views increase, as shown in Fig. 1. The SDS dilemma highlights that score distillation exhibits
distinctive optimization characteristics across sparse input views. Consequently, SDS is NOT readily
applicable for lifting visual supervision from diffusion priors under sparse views.
With the curiosity of the SDS dilemma in our mind, it can be recognized that the difference between
sparse views andtext prompts lies in the inline constraints sparse views bring. For the unsupervised
invisible views, unlike text prompts, the ideal rendered image supervision information is not com-
pletely absent. Due to the consistency of the 3D geometry and structure, the information exists
in the given sparse views, which we refer to the inline priors . Some researchers [ 15] attempt to
implicitly encode the given input sparse views to guide the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model,
thereby introducing inline priors. Nonetheless, owing to domain shifts between specific scenes and
the diffusion prior, a significant amount of external 3D annotated data and computational resources
are frequently necessitated for domain rectification [ 15]. To this end, a potentially viable approach is
exploring the feasibility of adjusting the optimization objective of SDS by incorporating inline priors
to facilitate efficient domain rectification without fine-tuning and pre-training.
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of SDS from the perspective of mode-seeking.
Intuitively, the optimization objective of SDS is to align the rendered image distribution with the
target mode in the diffusion prior. However, due to the inherent suboptimality of the rendered
image distribution under sparse views, SDS tends to deviate from the target mode, resulting in the
SDS dilemma. To tackle this challenge, we present Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM),
a method that rectifies the rendered image distribution by utilizing inline priors. IPSM leverages
the rectified distribution to divide the optimization objective of SDS into two sub-objectives. The
rectified distribution, as an intermediate state of the optimization objective, plays a role in controlling
the mode-seeking direction, thereby suppressing mode deviation and promoting improvements in
reconstruction. Moreover, we propose the pipeline IPSM-Gaussian, which combines IPSM with the
efficient explicit 3D representation 3DGS for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. In addition to IPSM,
IPSM-Gaussian integrates depth regularization to support inline priors and geometric consistency
regularization to narrow the discrepancy between the rendered image distribution and the rectified
distribution at the pixel level. Experimental results demonstrate that IPSM effectively leverages
visual knowledge from the diffusion priors to improve sparse-view 3D reconstruction. The presented
method achieves superior performance on publicly available datasets.
Overall, our contributions can be summarized as:
•Analysis of SDS from mode-seeking perspective . We present a comprehensive analysis of
SDS optimization characteristics under sparse views, revealing that the mode deviation of
SDS results in the optimization dilemma.
•Rectified score distillation method for sparse views . We propose Inline Prior Guided Score
Matching (IPSM), which utilizes inline priors provided by sparse views to rectify rendered
image distribution for controlling the direction of seeking the target mode.
•Pipeline using IPSM based on 3DGS . We present IPSM-Gaussian, a pipeline for sparse-view
3D reconstruction, which adopts IPSM for diffusion guidance, as well as depth and geometry
regularization to boost the performance of IPSM. The experiments show that IPSM-Gaussian
achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on public datasets.

Novel View Synthesis . Novel View Synthesis [ 27,1,2,28–31] aims to synthesize invisible novel
views given a set of images at seen viewpoints while preserving the geometric structure and appear-
ance of the original 3D scene [ 32–37]. NeRF [ 1,3,4], as an implicit 3D representation, adopts
volume rendering to establish an implicit mapping relationship from the positions and ray directions
to colors using a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP). Although NeRF can achieve photographic-realistic
rendering quality compared to traditional methods, its required training time and rendering speed
are not satisfactory [ 1,28]. Recently, 3DGS [ 2,5,6] has garnered attention from researchers by
achieving high training speeds and real-time rendering capabilities through explicit modeling of 3D
scenes using Gaussian point clouds and rasterization rendering [ 38–42]. To this end, we choose
3DGS instead of NeRF as the backbone of 3D representations and adopt it in subsequent experiments.
Sparse-view Novel View Synthesis . Although current training-based NVS techniques, i.e.NeRF [ 1]
and 3DGS [ 2], can achieve satisfactory rendering quality in scenarios with dense input views, the
quality of novel view synthesis significantly decreases under sparse views due to overfitting [ 43,12,
44,7,11,45]. To tackle this challenge, Yang et al. [8] leverage the optimization properties of MLP
and employ annealing strategies for positional encoding [ 36] tailored to the characteristics of NeRF,
but this cannot be directly applied to 3DGS. More broadly, some works [ 46,47] leverage the intrinsic
relationships between sparse views to augment the data required for model optimization, but this
does not address the established condition of information deficiency. More works involve introducing
external pre-trained priors as optimization guidance to supervise sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Jain
et al. [10] introduce CLIP [ 13] to provide semantic guidance. Li et al. [9] propose global-local depth
regularization with DPT [ 48] for geometric structure guidance. However, the aforementioned prior
information cannot directly provide visual supervision for sparse-view NVS like diffusion priors.
Sparse-view Novel View Synthesis with Diffusion Priors . Although diffusion priors can provide
more direct visual guidance, current works are limited by the mode deviation with using diffusion
priors directly. Liu et al. [16] leverage diffusion models to progressively generate pseudo-observations
at unseen views. Wu et al. [15] use PixelNeRF [ 49] to encode sparse inputs for guiding the trajectory
of diffusion priors. Unlike score distillation techniques, these works either require fine-tuning the
diffusion model for narrowing the mode range [ 16], or pre-training image encoders for guiding the
direction of the target mode [15], both of which consume many resources [16, 15]. Xiong et al. [14]
attempt to directly use SDS to extract the external visual prior of the diffusion model, but have to
suppress its weighting, thus achieving limited effects. Although view-conditioned diffusion priors
[50,51] have emerged recently, different to helpness for 3D generation [ 50,52], their guidance is
still limited for sparse-view reconstruction, which is detailedly discussed in the Appendix. Therefore,
how to use diffusion priors andhow to use score distillation under sparse views without fine-tuning,
pre-training, and the optimization dilemma shown in Fig. 1 have become crucial issues.
3 Method
With the phenomenon of the SDS dilemma shown in Fig. 1 in our mind, we have realized that SDS
that works for text prompts does not work equally well for sparse views. Therefore, we attempt to
analyze the disadvantages of SDS under sparse views and introduce inline constraints for effectively
extracting visual guidance of diffusion priors without fine-tuning and pre-training. We start with the
overview of 3DGS and also define the main symbols.

tersθthrough the following differentiable rendering function
x0(p) =NX

m=1(1−˜αm), (3)
where x0(p)is the rendering color at pixel pof rendered image x0, and ˜αnare computed from the
projected 2D Gaussians.
3.2 IPSM: Inline Prior Guided Score Matching
Review of Score Distillation Sampling . Intuitively, SDS tends to drive the rendered image distribu-
tion denoted with red color seeking the nearest mode of diffusion distribution denoted with blue color
guided by text prompts. Specifically, we denote the rendered image at viewpoint vjasxj
0=g(θ,vj),
where g(θ,·)is rendering function and θis the 3D representation needed optimization. Without
elaborating text prompts on the conditions for brevity, the posterior noisy distribution of rendered
images is defined as
qθ
t(xj
t)∼ N(xj
t;√¯αtxj
0,(1−¯αt)I). (4)
The prevailing score distillation works start from minimizing the reverse KL divergence between
the distribution of the noisy rendered images qθ
t(xj
t)and the noisy real-world distribution p∗
t(xj

represented by the pre-trained diffusion models, namely

the gradient ∇θLSDS(θ)considers the rendered image distribution of the 3D representation and
drives it closer to the pre-trained diffusion prior.
Following [ 23,53], we provide a further discussion of SDS. The optimization objective of Eq.
5 derives qθ
t(xj
t)to the high-density region of p∗
t(xj
t). Considering samples mT,mFfrom two
modes of p∗
t(xj
t), where mTis from target mode and mFis from failure mode. mFis harmless
for text-to-3D tasks due to the high information entropy properties of text prompts. However, for
sparse-view 3D reconstruction, this leads the optimized 3D representation to be inconsistent with
the given sparse images, thus causing optimization difficulties as shown in Fig. 2. Specifically, we
denote the L2 distance of two samples as Γ(·,·). We want√¯αtxj
0≈√¯αtmTfor any t, but the
gap between two modes is unclear when tincreases, i.e.Γ(√¯αtxj
0,√¯αtmT)≈Γ(√¯αtxj
0,√¯αtmF),
since|Γ(xj
0,mT)−Γ(xj
0,mF)|is not large enough for a small√¯αt. This results in the mode
aliasing for optimization and further affects the optimizing direction during training. To this end, the
4Figure 3: IPSM-Gaussian obtains the inline prior within sparse views through inversely warping seen
views to unseen pseudo views, thus modifying the rendered image distribution to the rectified distri-
bution. Consequently taking the rectified distribution as the intermediate state, two sub-optimization
objectives are utilized for controlling the optimization direction.
distribution of rendered images is not constrained to seeking the target mode, causing mode deviation.
Therefore, we aim to construct a rectified distribution excluded failure mode using the inline prior
from sparse views, whose sample mRprovides xj
0stable optimization guidance and amplifies
the gap |Γ(mR,mT)−Γ(mR,mF)|so that Γ(√¯αtmR,√¯αtmT)≪Γ(√¯αtmR,√¯αtmF), and
the rectified distribution is served as the bridge between xj
0andmTto control the mode-seeking
direction.
Inline Prior . Different from text-to-3D tasks, sparse views can achieve geometry consistency
guidance of novel views through camera pose transformation, namely the inline prior we mentioned
in Sec. 1. Therefore, we aim to utilize the additional visual information of sparse views compared to
text prompts to correct the erroneous tendency of SDS optimization. Specifically, we sample a set
of random pseudo viewpoints vjaround the seen views vi. Given the ground-truth image Ii
0at the
seen viewpoint vi, we formulate the transforming function ψ(Ii
0;Dj,Rj→i)which inversely warps
image Ii
0from viewpoint vitovj.Rj→irepresents the relative pose transformation between two
viewpoints, and Djis the alpha-blending rendered depth at viewpoint vjfollowing
Dj(p) =NX
n=1dn˜αnN−1Y
m=1(1−˜αm), (7)
where dnis the z-buffer of the n-th Gaussian. During transformation, each pixel location pjat the
pseudo viewpoint vjis warped to the pixel location pj→iat the seen viewpoint vi, andpj→ican be
represented by
pj→i∼KRj→iDj(pj)K−1pj, (8)
where Kis the camera intrinsic parameter. Then, we can obtain the warped image Ii→j
0(pj)using
inverse warping with the nearest sampling operator
Ii→j
0(pj) = Sampler( Ii
0,pj→i). (9)
However, this direct inverse warping may lead to warping distortion due to erroneous geometry.
Following [46], we tackle it through the generated consistency mask with an error threshold τ
Mi→j(pj) = Mask( ∥Dj(pj)−Di→j(pj)∥1< τ), (10)
where Di→j(pj) = Sampler( Di,pj→i)like Eq. 9. Eq. 10 ensures the filterability of erroneous
geometry using the difference between the warped depth of the seen viewpoint and the depth of the
pseudo viewpoint. In practice, the warped image Ii→j
0and its accompanying mask Mi→jare served
5as the inline geometry consistency prior to guide external diffusion prior scene specialization. The
intuitive explanation of inline priors can be found in Appendix B.7.
Inline Prior Guided Score Matching . Using score distillation directly in the case of sparse
views overlooks the inline geometry consistency prior within the sparse views themselves, which is
fundamentally different from text-to-3D. To this end, we rectify the distribution denoted with green
color from qθ
0(xj
0)to˜qθ,ϕ
0(xj
0|Mi→j⊙Ii→j
0,Mi→j)using the inline prior. As shown in Fig. 3, we
utilize the warped masked image Ii→j
0from the seen viewpoints to guide the sampling trajectory
ofˆxj;ϕ
0∼˜qθ,ϕ
0(xj
0|Mi→j⊙Ii→j
0,Mi→j), thus introducing the inline geometry consistency prior to
the score distillation. So our optimization objective is changed to minimizing (1) the KL divergence
between the noisy rendered image distribution qθ
t(xj
t)and the noisy rectified distribution ˜qθ,ϕ
t(xj
t);
(2) the KL divergence between the noisy rectified distribution ˜qθ,ϕ
t(xj
t)and the noisy diffusion prior
distribution p∗
t(xj

where ηris the adjustment parameter of the two sub-optimization objectives. In practice, we introduce
an inpainting diffusion model ϵϕ(xj
t, t,Mi→j⊙Ii→j
0,Mi→j), which shares the same V AE-feature
domain with the pre-trained diffusion model ϵ∗(xj
t, t)representing the real data distribution. So we
have the rectified gradient of score distillation

3.3 Training Details
Depth Regularization . In the warping process, it can be observed that the rendered depth influences
pixel mapping relations, which is detailed in Sec. 4. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate
monocular depth estimation prior to supervising rendered depth, thus providing the correct inline
prior. We use the Pearson Correlation to provide depth regularization, which can be represented as
Corr(Dr,Dm) =Cov(Dr,Dm)p
Var(Dr)Var(Dm). (14)
Given the rendered depth Di
r, monocular depth Di
mfrom the input view Ii
0at the seen view vi, and
the rendered depth Dj
r, monocular depth Dj
mfrom the rendered image xj
0at the unseen view vj, we
take the depth regularization as
Ldepth =ηd∥Corr(Di
r,Di
m)∥1+∥Corr(Dj
r,Dj
m)∥1, (15)
where ηdserves as the weight to balance the supervision of seen views and pseudo-unseen views.
Geometry Consistency Regularization . In Eq. 13, we introduce LG1
IPSM for providing guidance
to minimize the reverse KL divergence between the rendered image and rectified distribution. In
practice, we not only supervise from the diffusion feature domain but also provide stronger guidance
by directly adding masked L1 loss of xj
0andIi→j
0, which is denoted as the geometry consistency
regularization and can be represented as
Lgeo=∥Mi→j⊙(xj

Total Training Objectives . Overall, our training objectives can be divided into three parts: 1) The
direct supervision L1andLssimof the sparse input views, which are inherited from the vanilla 3DGS;
2) The supervision LIPSM provided by diffusion priors using IPSM; 3) The supervision of depth and
vision information Ldepth andLgeoto support the inline priors and provide low-level inline guidance.
The total training loss function can be summarized as
L=λ1L1+λssimLssim+λdepthLdepth +λgeoLgeo+λIPSMLIPSM. (17)
More training details are shown in the Appendix A.2.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experiments Settings
Datasets and Metrics . We evaluate our method on the LLFF [ 22] and DTU dataset [ 54]. The
LLFF dataset involves 8 forward-facing scenes and we select 3 training views following prevailing
works [ 8,7]. On the DTU dataset, we choose the 15 testing scenes, and 3 training views whose
IDs are 25, 22, and 28, following RegNeRF [ 7]. Following prevailing works [ 7–9] to focus on the
object-of-interest for the DTU dataset, we also remove the background with the mask of objects when
evaluating. Aligning with the protocol of baselines, we apply the downsampling rate of 8 and 4 on
the LLFF and DTU datasets respectively. We evaluate the reconstruction quality using SSIM [ 59],
LPIPS [ 60], and PSNR. Following DNGaussian [ 9] and FreeNeRF [ 8], we also report A VGE for a
comprehensive evaluation of the reconstruction quality. The A VGE is calculated by the geometric
mean of√
1−SSIM ,LPIPS , and MSE = 10−PSNR/10. The experiments are conducted 3 times and
we report the mean and standard deviation. More details about datasets, e.g.the sparsity of training
views and train-test split protocols, can be found in Appendix A.1.
Implementation details . Our method is built on 3DGS instead of NeRF due to the advantages of
3DGS on high training speed and real-time rendering. Following prevailing works [ 8,9], the camera
poses are known before optimization. The initialized point clouds are estimated by Structure from
Motion (SfM) [ 61] only using the given sparse input views. The total training process involves 10K
iterations for experiments on all datasets. The guidance of pseudo views starts from 2K iteration
and ends at 9.5K iteration. Following FSGS, we introduce the proximity-guided Gaussian unpooling
operation [ 58] and retain the high tolerance for large Gaussian points without size thresholds. For
the score distillation methods, we randomly select one of 3 training views to generate BLIP-based

[62] text prompts. Background priors are introduced on DTU for accurately reconstructing the
object-of-interest. All experimental results are obtained on a single RTX 3090. More training details
and experimental environments can be found in Appendix A.2 and A.3.
Baselines . Following prevailing works, we compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods,
i.e.SRF [ 55], PixelNeRF [ 49], MVSNeRF [ 56], Mip-NeRF [ 57], DietNeRF [ 10], RegNeRF [ 7],
FreeNeRF [ 8], SparseNeRF [ 12], the vanilla 3DGS [ 2], FSGS [ 58] and DNGaussian [ 9] as our
baselines. Except for the reproduced results of the 3DGS [ 2] on the LLFF dataset, and 3DGS [ 2]
and FSGS [ 58] on the DTU dataset, the rest are based on the values reported. Since the original
DNGaussian uses random initialization, while other 3DGS methods use SfM [ 61], we also report the
provided LLFF results of using SfM [61]. Reproduction details can be found in the Appendix A.4.
4.2 Comparison with Other Methods
LLFF . The quantitative results on the LLFF dataset [ 22] are shown in Tab. 1. Our method shows
significant improvement and achieves the best reconstruction quality among state-of-the-art methods
under multi-metric evaluation. For the NeRF-based methods, SSIM of our method is improved by
+12.5%compared to SparseNeRF [ 12], and LPIPS is improved by +32.79% compared to FreeNeRF
[8], which are the state-of-the-art in the NeRF-based methods respectively. For the 3DGS-based
methods, the A VGE of our method is improved by +6.48% and+7.34% compared to the state-
of-the-art FSGS [ 58] and DNGaussian †[9] respectively. Note that the vanilla DNGaussian uses
random initialization, but the 3DGS, FSGS, and our method use SfM initialization. Thus, we also
report the provided results of SfM-initialized DNGaussian which is denoted by †. The qualitative
results are shown in Fig. 4. Due to the lack of external priors, 3DGS [ 2] and FreeNeRF [ 8] show the
optimization tendencies of 3D representations themselves, which are high-frequency artifacts and
low-frequency smoothness respectively. Although DNGaussian [ 9] using external depth prior can
suppress artifacts, it only uses coarse-grained depth guidance and lacks fine-grained visual guidance,
so the rendered image lacks high-frequency information. Our approach achieves improvements in
both visual and geometric quality.

Tab. 1. The A VGE of our method is improved by
+23.76% compared to FSGS [ 58] and +21.43%
compared to FreeNeRF [ 8]. Note that DNGaus-
sian [ 9] does not provide the corresponding pa-
rameter settings for using SfM [ 61] initializa-
tion on the DTU dataset [ 54]. The qualitative
results are shown in Fig. 5. SparseNeRF [ 12]
and DNGaussian [ 9], which only use depth priors, cannot obtain guidance on visual texture details,
causing optimization difficulties. Our IPSM-Gaussian using diffusion priors can obtain textured
details of reconstruction close to the Ground Truth.
Details of reported experimental results are shown in Appendix B.3. More rendered novel views and
qualitative comparisons can be found in the Appendix B.8.

4.3 Ablation Study
We conduct detailed ablations of regularization terms on the LLFF dataset [ 22] shown in Tab.
2. We can notice that the first two regularization terms, i.e.IPSM and depth, provide significant
improvements. The first three lines demonstrate the promoting effect of our proposed IPSM on the
reconstruction quality of 3D representations, e.g.using IPSM boosts 9.8%on the LPIPS and 9.6%on
the A VGE compared to the Base. It is worth noting that since the inline prior requires an accurate
rendering depth from the unseen perspective shown in Eq. 8. The impact of depth error on inline
priors is shown in Fig. 6 (a). However, the diffusion priors, as a kind of visual supervision, cannot
provide direct depth geometry guidance, so an additional external depth prior needs to be introduced,
which can support the accuracy of inline prior to further provide performance improvements. In Fig.
6 (b), we show the visual and geometry improvements of IPSM and depth regularization. The last
line in Tab. 2 introduces the geometry consistency regularization for providing pixel-wise guidance,
which shows a steady improvement. More additional ablations are detailed in the Appendix B.4.
4.4 Comparison to SDS
As shown in Fig. 1, SDS guidance is hard to provide effective supervision but tends to hinder
reconstruction due to the mode deviation we have analyzed. Due to the too-strong semantic visual
supervision of SDS(CFG=100), the performance increases significantly in the final 500 iterations after
the 2K-9.5K prior-added period instead. In this section, we report the final evaluated performance
comparison of Base (without any regularization), w/ SDS(CFG=7.5) ,w/ SDS(CFG=100) , and w/
IPSM(CFG=7.5) in Tab 3. Except for SDS (CFG=7.5), which can provide a limited improvement in
structural similarity compared to the Base, the other performances show a downward trend, which is
colored by blue. However, IPSM can provide considerable improvements in multiple metrics which
are colored by red. It is supposed to be noted that all the experiments of SDS shown in Fig. 1 and
Tab. 3 are under the same experimental setting. We also present the qualitative comparison of SDS.
As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the guidance of SDS will produce the imaginary reconstruction caused by
mode deviation when using the diffusion prior directly. This property is reasonable and acceptable in
text-to-3D generation tasks, but it fails in specific scene reconstructions limited by sparse views. As
shown in Fig. 7 (b), we can observe that SDS will also produce large floaters during optimization,

w/ SDS(CFG=100) 0.576 (-7.84%) 0.367 (-44.49%) 17.53 (-7.74%) 0.162 (-29.60%)
w/ IPSM(CFG=7.5) 0.670 (+7.20%) 0.229 (+9.84%) 19.60 (+3.16%) 0.113 (+9.60%)
which indicates the characteristic of its training instability since SDS overlooks the inline prior of
sparse views and is hard to provide stable guidance towards target mode.
The experiments are conducted 3 times reporting the average results, and use the weight of 2.0 and the
V AE encoder same as IPSM for fair comparisons. Since the feature domains of Stable Diffusion and
Stable Diffusion Inpainting are identical, using the original V AE of Stable Diffusion shows similar
performance, which is reported in the Appendix B.2. We have also analyzed the training instability
of SDS additionally in Appendix B.1. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of using view-conditioned
diffusion prior for SDS in Appendix B.6.
5 Conclusions and Limitations
In this paper, we start by revisiting the phenomenon where SDS not only fails to improve optimization
in sparse-view 3D reconstruction but degrades performance. We present a comprehended analysis
of SDS from a mode-seeking perspective. Based on these observations and analyses, we propose
Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which utilizes the sparse-view input as the inline
prior to rectifying the rendered image distribution. IPSM utilizes the rectified distribution as an
intermediate state to decompose the mode-seeking optimization objective of SDS for controlling
the optimization direction of mode-seeking to suppress mode deviation. We further propose the
pipeline IPSM-Gaussian, which selects 3DGS as the backbone and incorporates IPSM with depth and
geometry regularization for boosting IPSM. Experimental results on different public datasets show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality compared to other current methods.
The limitation of our method is that the rectified distribution needs to match the same feature space
as the diffusion prior, which restricts the range of inpainting models used for the rectified distribution,
thereby limiting the scalability and performance of our method. An alternative improvement could be
substituting the pre-trained inpainting models with fine-tuning the diffusion prior like VSD. However,
it would further increase the computational complexity of the method. We leave it as our future work.

A.1 Datasets Details
LLFF Dataset. The LLFF dataset [ 22] is a forward-facing dataset, which contains 8 challenging
scenes. Following FreeNeRF [ 8] and DNGaussian [ 9], we select every 8th image for testing and
evenly sample the remaining images for 3 input views. Following DNGaussian [ 9], we downsample
the resolutions of images to 8×for both training and testing. In Tab. 4, we report the level of sparsity
for intuitive exhibition. The Original Training Views means the number of training views for the
original dense-view NVS, and the Sparsity of 3 Views means the ratio of 3 input sparse views to the
Original Training Views.

DTU Dataset. The DTU dataset [ 54] contains 124 scenes in total. PixelNeRF [ 49] and MVSNeRF
[56] split the DTU dataset [ 54] into 88 training scenes for pre-training and 15 testing scenes for
per-scene fine-tuning. Following RegNeRF [ 7], FreeNeRF [ 8], and DNGaussian [ 9], we only use
the selected 15 testing scenes for optimization. The IDs of testing scenes are: 8, 21, 30, 31, 34, 38,
40, 41, 45, 55, 63, 82, 103, 110, and 114. For each scene optimization with the 3-view setting, the
IDs of images served as sparse views for training are 25, 22, and 28. The IDs of images that served
as testing novel views for evaluation are 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32,
33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47. Following FreeNeRF [ 8] and DNGaussian [ 9], all metrics for the
evaluation of the DTU dataset are computed with the object mask. Following DNGaussian [ 9], we
use the estimated pose which is exactly the same as DNGaussian [ 9]. Following RegNeRF [ 34], we
downsample the resolutions of images to 4×for both training and testing.
A.2 Training Details
SfM Initialization. Following FSGS [ 58], we use SfM [ 61] initialization with 3 input sparse views
only for the 3D Gaussian points initialization. However, sometimes SfM will fail when using sparse
input images. In practice, scan 30 and scan 110 of the DTU dataset cannot extract enough features
for initial point cloud prediction, so we only perform random initialization on these two scenes. We
perform SfM [ 61] initialization on the remaining scenes of the DTU dataset [ 54] and all scenes of the
LLFF dataset [ 22]. It is supposed to be noted that SfM [ 61] initialization will significantly improve
the final reconstruction quality, so random initialization of these two scenarios will not improve our
final performance but must be dealt with due to factual limitations.
Gaussian Unpooling. Following FSGS [ 58], we introduce the operation of Gaussian unpooling for
filling the spaces uniformly and geometry fitting. The Gaussian unpooling determines whether to add
a new Gaussian point by calculating the K-nearest neighbor graph structure of the Gaussian point
and its corresponding Euclidean distance metric ( K= 3in practice). The SH coefficients of newly
densified Gaussian points are set to 0. In this paper, both experiments of our method, corresponding
ablations, and explorations on SDS using different diffusion priors adopt this operation.
Gaussian Size Threshold. The vanilla 3DGS [ 2] filters out Gaussian points with excessively large
sizes, but in the case of sparse views, discarding these large-sized Gaussian points can lead to
poor fitting of low-frequency regions during the optimization process. Following FSGS [ 58] and
DNGaussian [ 9], we have eliminated this Gaussian point size filtering operation, which significantly
enhances the performance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction.
15Training Strategy. Following FSGS [ 58], the maximum degree of SH coefficients is set to 3, and
we level up the SH degree every 500 iterations. The total training iterations is 10K for all datasets.
Following FSGS [ 58], we introduce the warm-up period of 500 iterations for the beginning of the
pseudo views supervision, i.e.the 2K iteration, and we reduce the weight of the depth regularization
of seen views to 0.001 after the end of pseudo views supervision, i.e.the 9.5K iteration.
Background Prior. Following FreeNeRF [ 8] and DNGaussian [ 9] on the optimization prior based
on pixel value ( i.e.FreeNeRF: white and black background prior; DNGaussian: strategic masking
of black backgrounds), we introduce the mask for the white and black background served as an
additional prior on the DTU dataset [ 54] for the selection of previous work [ 7–9] in accurately
reconstructing the object-of-interest [ 7]. Specifically, we mask the values of images that are less than
30/255≈0.1176 (Following DNGaussian [ 9], the vertical scan rectangles are also introduced to
reduce mask of black regions), and larger than 0.99for L1 losses of all scenarios on the DTU dataset.
Gaussian Points Controlling. The opacity of Gaussian points would be reset at the 2K iteration.
The opacity would not be reset for the following iterations on the LLFF dataset [ 22] and the opacity
would be reset every 1K iterations for the following iterations on the DTU dataset [ 54] due to the
easy over-fitting property associated with large view differences. Besides, the Gaussian points are
densified every 100 iterations and pruned every 500 iterations for all datasets.
Text Prompts. For the experiment of score distillation methods, we randomly selected one of the 3
training images and used BLIP [ 62] to extract the corresponding text prompts. For fair comparisons,
the text prompts corresponding to each scene on all datasets of all score distillation methods relying
on text prompts are identical.
A.3 Hyper-parameters
For the inline prior, the mask threshold τis set to 0.3 for IPSM regularization and 0.1 for the geometry
consistency regularization, since the latter is at pixel level thus requiring more strict constraints. For
the diffusion priors guidance, the weight λIPSM of IPSM regularization LIPSM is set to 2.0for all
datasets, and the parameter ηrfor controlling LG1
IPSM andLG2
IPSM is set to 0.1 for all datasets. The
parameter ηdfor controlling the depth guidance of seen views and pseudo unseen views is set to 0.1
for all datasets. On the LLFF dataset [ 22], the weight λdepth of depth regularization Ldepth is set to
0.5and the weight λgeoof the geometry consistency regularization Lgeois set to 2.0.λssimis set to
0.2andλ1= 1−λssimfollowing 3DGS [ 2]. On the DTU dataset [ 54], following DNGaussian [ 9],
we reduce λ1to0.4(i.e.increase λssimto0.6), and at the same time reduce λdepth andλgeo, both of
which are multiplied by 0.1.
A.4 Reproduction of Baselines
3DGS. We use the vanilla 3DGS [ 2] for reproduction on the LLFF [ 22] and DTU [ 54] dataset. We
do not make any other changes except for the necessary operations to render depth and convert
dense views to sparse-view training. In addition, all our experiments use the rasterizer of FSGS
[58] to ensure fairness, although this rasterizer has the same function as the rasterizer of 3DGS [ 2].
Meanwhile, the reported results of 3DGS [ 2] are also obtained with the SfM [ 61] initialization which
is the same as ours.
FSGS. We use the official code of FSGS [ 58] to reproduce the results on the DTU dataset [ 54]. Since
FSGS [ 58] performed experiments on the LLFF dataset [ 22], we report the results provided by FSGS
[58]. Since FSGS [ 58] does not conduct experiments on the DTU dataset [ 54], we reproduce it and
add the white & black mask prior to it, which is the same as ours and detailed in Appendix A.2. On
the DTU dataset [ 54], we adopt the hyper-parameters of FSGS [ 58] on the MipNeRF-360 dataset [ 35]
(i.e.the weight of depth regularization on the pseudo views is 0.03, the weight of depth regularization
on the seen views is 0.05, and the supervision interval on the pseudo unseen views is 10) because we
observe that the selected hyper-parameters are more suitable for non-forward-facing datasets and can
achieve better performance than directly using the hyper-parameters on the LLFF dataset [ 22]. The
reproduction of FSGS [ 58] on the DTU dataset [ 54] is also enhanced by the SfM [ 61] initialization
same as ours.
DNGaussian. The original DNGaussian [ 9] does not use SfM [ 61] initialization. However, directly
changing the random initialization to SfM [ 61] initialization without changing the hyper-parameters

makes it difficult to provide sufficient performance improvement due to the incompatibility of a
series of hyper-parameters such as the learning rate. Therefore, we only report the results provided
by DNGaussian [ 9] using SfM [ 61] initialization on the LLFF dataset [ 22] and do not report the
reproduced results of directly using the original random initialization hyper-parameters with SfM
[61] initialization on the DTU dataset [54].
A.5 Experimental Environments and Computing Resources
All the experiments are conducted on a single RTX 3090 with CUDA 11.3. The training time of
IPSM-Gaussian is about 1 hour on the RTX 3090, which is mainly due to the inference time of the
diffusion model itself. For pseudo view supervision from 2K to 9.5K iteration, we need to perform
two inferences of the diffusion model in each iteration to calculate LG1
IPSM andLG2
IPSM .
B Additional Experimental Results
B.1 Training Instability of SDS
In practice, it can be noticed that using SDS directly can produce training instability, which is shown
in Tab. 5. Using SDS [ 23] causes more performance differences between independent experiments,
i.e.training instability. The standard deviation of 3 independent experiments using SDS (CFG=7.5)
is about 9 times that of IPSM on the SSIM, about 6 times that of IPSM on the LPIPS, and about
3 times that of IPSM on the PSNR. The standard deviation of 3 independent experiments using
SDS (CFG=100) is about 3 times that of IPSM on the SSIM, about 3 times that of IPSM on the
LPIPS, and about 2 times that of IPSM on the PSNR. This is because SDS [ 23], as a score distillation
technique guided by text-prompt semantics, overlooks the inline priors present in the sparse-view
3D reconstruction task from a limited number of input viewpoints. Owing to the high information
entropy inherent in the text, it is hard for SDS to provide stable guidance of diffusion priors towards
the target mode during training, leading to instability in the final reconstruction quality.
To further illustrate the training instability of SDS [ 23], additional experiments of SDS [ 23] on the
LLFF dataset [ 22] are conducted 3 times, which is shown in Tab. 6. It is supposed to be noted that the

reported results of SDS [ 23] in the main manuscript are NOT out of the re-conducted experiments.
In 3 re-conducted experiments, we can still observe the instability exhibited by SDS compared to
our method. The standard deviation of 3 independent experiments using SDS (CFG=7.5) is about 11
times that of IPSM on the SSIM, about 13 times that of IPSM on the LPIPS, and about 8 times that
of IPSM on the PSNR. The standard deviation of 3 independent experiments using SDS (CFG=100)
is about 4 times that of IPSM on the SSIM, about 4 times that of IPSM on the LPIPS, and about 4
times that of IPSM on the PSNR.
B.2 SDS with Different V AE
For a fair comparison, we report the results of SDS on the LLFF dataset [ 22] using the V AE same to
us,i.e.the V AE of Stable Diffusion Inpainting v1-5 [ 63], in the main manuscript. To demonstrate the
reconstruction quality of SDS [ 23] in more detail, we report the experimental results of using the

employing the original V AE, i.e.the V AE of Stable Diffusion v1-5, are also independently repeated
thrice. It can be observed that V AE of Stable Diffusion v1-5 and V AE of Stable Diffusion Inpainting
v1-5 exhibit nearly identical performances, with the V AE of Stable Diffusion v1-5 (CFG=7.5) even
demonstrating greater instability. These experiments further elucidate the mode deviation issue and
training instability problem in SDS [23].
B.3 Details of Reported Experimental Results
The details of the reported experimental results in the main manuscript are shown in Tab. 8 and Tab. 9.
Tab. 8 shows the details corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of our method as described
in Tab. 1 in the main manuscript, obtained from 3 independent experiments with 3-views setting on
the LLFF dataset [ 22] and DTU dataset [ 54], respectively. Tab. 9 shows the details corresponding
to the mean and standard deviation as described in Tab. 2 in the main manuscript, obtained from 3
independent experiments with 3-views setting on the LLFF dataset. Note that the individual results of
the first and third row are shown in Tab. 5. The individual results of the last row are shown in Tab. 8.
B.4 Additional Ablation Results
To supplement more complete experimental results, we provide an additional ablation study using
3 views on the LLFF and DTU dataset in Tab. 10 and Tab. 11 respectively. We can see that
Ldepth presents a strong prior for optimization since it directly provides the 3D geometric guidance
on 3D representations. Notably, although both LgeoandLIPSM utilize re-projection techniques
to introduce the 2D visual prior information of the sparse views to promote optimization, LIPSM
achieves satisfactory performance comparable to direct 3D guidance of Ldepth as shown in Tab. 10
and Tab. 11. At the same time, it is difficult for Lgeoto promote optimization independently without
the assistance of other regularizations.
Besides, in repeated experiments, we also notice that both IPSM and depth regularization can
promote the stability of training of 3D Gaussians. As shown in Tab. 10, both IPSM and depth

regularization can greatly suppress the fluctuation of reconstruction results in structural similarity and
perception evaluation quality, i.e.SSIM and LPIPS. However, unlike depth prior, IPSM has a limited
suppression effect on the fluctuations of the pixel-level evaluation, i.e.PSNR, which is consistent
with the randomness of the fluctuations of the baseline as shown in Tab. 10 and Tab. 11. This
is because the depth prior participates in optimization throughout the training process (namely [0,
10K] iterations), while IPSM only participates in optimization in [2K, 9.5K] iterations. Due to the
significant randomness of 3DGS itself under sparse views [ 64] (especially in more difficult scenarios
in DTU compared to LLFF), the optimization of 3DGS itself in the first 2K training iterations may
collapse in some scenarios, e.g.scan 103, 30, 82, which in turn affects the optimization guidance of the
regularization term in subsequent optimizations. Even so, IPSM has a very significant improvement
in SSIM and LPIPS compared to Lgeowhich also uses re-projection technology, and is comparable
to direct 3D guidance of depth prior as shown in Tab. 11.
B.5 Additional Experiments with Different Input Views

of our method when working with sparse views. We provide additional experimental results under 6

and 9 input views on the LLFF dataset in Tab. 12 and Tab. 13 respectively. Notably, our method uses
exactly the same parameters as the LLFF dataset with 3 views for training. For the 6 input views ,
as shown in Tab. 12, we achieve an improvement of 11.18% on LPIPS compared to ReconFusion
[15]. It is supposed to be noted that ReconFusion [ 15] requires additional computational resources
for pre-training an encoder with external data as we demonstrated in the main manuscript. Excluding
methods that require additional resources for pre-training, our method achieves improvements of
7.94%,8.34%,31.82%,30.68% on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and A VGE respectively, compared to
DNGaussian [ 9], which is the state-of-the-art method based on the 3DGS [ 2]. For the 9 input views ,
similar to the experimental results of 6 input views, our method still outperforms all state-of-the-art
methods on SSIM, LPIPS, and A VGE scores and achieves comparable results on PSNR. As shown
in Tab. 13, compared to 3DGS-based DNGaussian [ 9], we achieve improvements of 8.46%,8.50%,
38.33%,33.77% on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and A VGE respectively.
Less input views . To evaluate extreme circumstances, e.g.opposite views and extrapolation sce-
narios, we construct corresponding data and conduct experiments with the state-of-the-art method
DNGaussian [ 9]. For the two opposite input views , we select 2 opposite views of each scene on
the MipNeRF-360 dataset, i.e. the IDs of training views of each scene: 2, 26 of bicycle; 22, 151
of bonsai; 57, 185 of counter; 1, 57 of garden; 14, 171 of kitchen; 2, 79 of room; 26, 34 of stump.
The test views are selected every 8th image following Mip-NeRF. The quantitative comparisons
with state-of-the-art method DNGaussian [ 9] are shown in Tab. 14. It can be seen that our method
outperforms DNGaussian [ 9] and our model achieves improvements of 21.90%,18.86% on average
PSNR and A VGE scores respectively. For the extrapolation scenarios , We select 2 views on 0 and
90 degrees of each scene on the MipNeRF-360 dataset, i.e. IDs: 2, 14 of bicycle; 22, 248 of bonsai;
57, 145 of counter; 1, 15 of garden; 14, 37 of kitchen; 2, 291 of room; 26, 28 of stump. The test views
are selected on the 180 degrees, i.e. IDs: 26 of bicycle; 151 of bonsai; 185 of counter; 57 of garden;
171 of kitchen; 79 of room; 34 of stump. The quantitative results similar to opposite views are shown
in Tab. 14. It can be seen that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method DNGaussian
[9] and our model achieves improvements of 27.27%,22.57% on average PSNR and A VGE scores
respectively. We can notice that although our method is improved compared to DNGaussian, in fact,
current sparse-view reconstruction methods (including our method) cannot successfully reconstruct
extreme cases. We leave it as our future work.

B.6 Additional Evaluation and Discussion of View-conditioned Diffusion Priors
It is worth noting that the SDS mentioned before are all based on the 2D diffusion priors . A natural
idea is that we can use the 3D diffusion prior with the vanilla SDS to promote sparse-view 3D
reconstruction without designing a complex method to extract 3D visual knowledge from the 2D
diffusion prior. In this section, we discuss using view-conditioned 3D diffusion priors with SDS to
improve the reconstruction quality under sparse views. We conduct experiments on the LLFF dataset
with 3 views using view-conditioned 3D diffusion priors to evaluate their visual guidance of them.
Specifically, we use the 3D prior, i.e.Zero-1-to-3 [ 50] and ZeroNVS [ 51], and their default CFG to
optimize the 3D scene under sparse views through the vanilla SDS. We also use the same backbone
and weights as IPSM. Besides, we explore the effect of warmup operation for the SDS regularization
of 3D priors.

As shown in Tab. 15, the first three rows and the last row are the experimental results mentioned
before. The fourth line shows the result of using the Inpainting Stable Diffusion model (ISD) with
inline priors to assist SDS, which is actually the ablation result of LG1
IPSM in the ablation experiment
shown in Tab. 2. We can notice that both Zero-1-to-3 and ZeroNVS can only provide limited visual
guidance and may even hinder reconstruction compared to the Baseline. Besides, using ZeroNVS
[51] is superior compared to using Zero-1-to-3 [ 50] since the former utilizes 3D annotated scene data
for fine-tuning while Zero-1-to-3 only uses 3D objects dataset for fine-tuning. However, although
ZeroNVS [ 51] as 3D prior can achieve stunning results in single-view reconstruction for inferring
3D structure from an unlabeled 2D image [ 51], it still cannot boost the sparse-view reconstruction
quality as IPSM since the ZeroNVS guidance does not exploit inline priors for sparse views which is
different from the single-view setting.
Currently, 3D diffusion priors already have a certain ability to represent the 3D world. However, as
reported experimental results in Tab. 15, 3D diffusion priors still cannot provide a significant boost
on different 3D scene datasets, since the scarcity of 3D annotation data used to fine-tune 3D diffusion
priors exists. Specifically, ZeroNVS [ 51] fine-tuned on a mixture million-level dataset consisting of
CO3D [ 65], ACID [ 66,67], and RealEstate10K [ 68]. But, Stable Diffusion [ 63] and its inpainting
version are trained on billion-level LAION-5B [ 69]. With the additional conducted experiments, we
notice that there is still an objective fact that 3D training data for 3D diffusion models is scarce. How
to efficiently construct high-fidelity 3D data, or how to use 2D data knowledge to complement the
training of 3D diffusion prior remains a core challenge in this field.
B.7 Intuitive Explanation of Inline Priors
To visually demonstrate the effect of inline priors for rectification on the diffusion prior more
intuitively, we show the inline priors along with their associated visual content in Fig. 8 as a intuitive
supplement to our motivation. Note that we choose a relatively tight depth error threshold to better
illustrate the potential of the rectified distribution. The first column shows the input sparse seen-view

the masked warped images, known as inline priors, which integrate visual inline information from
the seen view to the pseudo unseen views, thereby laying the foundation for subsequent rectification
of the diffusion prior; and the seventh column intuitively exhibits images obtained through 25-step
sampling using noise-added rendering images served as latents and inline priors served as conditions
with Stable Diffusion Inpainting v1-5 [ 63], representing the rectified mode of the corresponding
scenes in the rectified distribution.

25NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Abstract and Sec. 1.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Sec. 5.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
26Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.2 and A.3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
27Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The code is released at https://github.com/iCVTEAM/IPSM .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.1, A.2, and A.3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All experiments are conducted 3 times. We report mean and standard deviation
in the main manuscript. See individual results in Appendix B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
28•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.5.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the research conducted in
the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
29•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, are properly credited and the license and terms of use are explicitly mentioned and
properly respected.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
30•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
