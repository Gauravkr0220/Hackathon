Abstract
Recently, vision model pre-training has evolved from relying on manually annotated
datasets to leveraging large-scale, web-crawled image-text data. Despite these
advances, there is no pre-training method that effectively exploits the interleaved
image-text data, which is very prevalent on the Internet. Inspired by the recent
success of compression learning in natural language processing, we propose a
novel vision model pre-training method called Latent Compression Learning (LCL)
for interleaved image-text data. This method performs latent compression learning
by maximizing the mutual information between the inputs and outputs of a causal
attention model. The training objective can be decomposed into two basic tasks:
1) contrastive learning between visual representation and preceding context, and
2) generating subsequent text based on visual representation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our method not only matches the performance of CLIP on paired
pre-training datasets (e.g., LAION), but can also leverage interleaved pre-training
data (e.g., MMC4) to learn robust visual representations from scratch, showcasing
the potential of vision model pre-training with interleaved image-text data. Code is
released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LCL .
1 Introduction
Over the past decade, ImageNet [ 34] pre-trained vision models have significantly advanced computer
vision, continuously achieving breakthroughs in various vision tasks [ 7,24,10]. The success of
ImageNet has inspired further exploration of better methods for pre-training vision models from
scratch. Recently, the focus of pre-training has shifted from manually annotated data to large-scale,
web-crawled image-text data. A key milestone in this shift is CLIP [ 55], which utilizes image-text
pair data hundreds of times larger than ImageNet, delivering superior performance across various
tasks and progressively becoming the mainstream method for vision model pre-training. Building
on this trend, there is increasing interest in exploring interleaved image-text data, which is more
prevalent on the Internet. Unlike the structured image-text pairs used in CLIP, this interleaved data is
free-format and non-paired, larger in scale, and richer in textual information. Fully exploiting these
interleaved image-text data is necessary for further improving vision model pre-training at scale.

Figure 1: Comparison of different training frameworks. (a) Contrastive learning framework from
CLIP [ 55] pre-trains vision encoders from scratch with image-text pairs, but it does not support
interleaved data. (b)Our proposed LCL pre-training frameworkm can effectively pre-train vision
encoders from scratch with interleaved image-text data. In these two frameworks, the text encoder or
the language model that provides supervision can be optionally discarded during the transfer stage.
(c)Multi-modal incremental training process uses interleaved image-text data to align the pre-trained
vision encoder and the language model, but it cannot pre-train vision encoders from scratch.
Currently, no pre-training method can effectively utilize interleaved image-text data to pre-train vision
models from scratch. In preliminary attempts [ 2,29,44] of using interleaved data, vision models
were already pre-trained by CLIP on paired image-text data. Subsequent training on interleaved data
primarily serves to align the pre-trained vision models with language models, thereby enhancing the
multi-modal capabilities of the entire vision-language network. Therefore, it remains an important
and open problem of how to effectively learn robust visual representation from scratch on interleaved
image-text data.
A recent study [ 30] in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests that the success of modern
language models originates from the compression of training datasets into model parameters. We
believe that such compression learning is also applicable to the multi-modal field, except that the data
to be compressed expands from structured plain texts to interleaved image-text data, where the images
are of raw pixels and unstructured. Such compression learning should be revised to accommodate to
the image data. Raw pixels are unstructured and often contain unnecessary and unpredictable details.
Such details are irrelevant to the high-level semantic tasks and should be discarded in compression
learning. Thus, we argue that compression learning on interleaved text-image data should be applied
to latent image representation to better extract semantic abstracts.
In this paper, we propose a novel visual pre-training framework, named Latent Compression Learning.
We first theoretically demonstrate that effective latent compression learning can be performed by
maximizing the mutual information between outputs and inputs of a causal attention model. When
applied to visual pre-training on interleaved image-text data, visual latents are extracted through a
visual encoding network (such as ViT [ 20]), and then fed together with the text into a causal model.
The optimization objective can be derived and decomposed into two parts: 1) contrastive learning
between visual latent representation and their previous context to enhance semantic consistency, and
2)auto-regressive prediction to learn the predictability of visual representation for subsequent text.
These two training objectives complement each other. For images, the learned latent representation
retain information that can be predicted from previous contexts and information needed for predicting
subsequent contexts, thus providing effective visual pre-training.
In the experiments, various interleaved and paired pre-training methods are evaluated. The evaluation
is conducted through transfer learning on multiple tasks, including image classification, image-text
retrieval, image captioning, and visual dialogue. The pre-training datasets include the widely used
image-text paired LAION-400M [ 57] and the image-text interleaved MMC4 [ 88] and Obelics [ 36].
In addition, we also re-organize an interleaved version of LAION-Random and a paired version
of MMC4-Pair, to facilitate the comparison between interleaved and paired pre-training methods
under the same data source. Experiment results show that our LCL pre-training can achieve the same
2performance as CLIP on paired pre-training data and can better utilize interleaved pre-training data.
Our results also demonstrate the effectiveness of using interleaved image-text data to learn robust
visual representation from scratch, and the potential of compression learning for visual pre-training.
2 Related Work
Vision-centric Pre-training Methods. Supervised Pre-training on large-scale annotated datasets [ 24,
62,48,82] has remained the mainstream method for a long time, and has been favored by various
vision tasks [ 9,24,79,7] demonstrating strong performance. Self-Supervised Pre-training has
gained significant popularity due to its advantage of utilizing unlabeled data. BEiT [ 6] follows the
methodology of BERT [ 19] by randomly masking image tokens and reconstructing them as targets.
MAE [ 27] and SimMIM [ 80] directly use masked pixels as reconstruction targets, making the pre-
training process more straightforward and efficient. Weakly-Supervised Pre-training leverages image-
hashtag [ 50,76,63] and image-text datasets [ 71,61,8,57], which rely on noisy text supervision
from the internet. For image-hashtag datasets, related works [ 50,63] have shown comparatively
good performance across various transfer learning settings. In the case of image-text datasets, early
efforts [ 3,42,49,64,66,67,70,13,39] focused on learning general visual-linguistic representation.
Recently, exemplified by CLIP [ 55], methods [ 55,32] have been developed that involve pre-training
through aligned visual-linguistic representation, achieving outstanding results in image classification
tasks. Other works like M3I Pre-training [ 65] propose a unified framework that integrates multiple
pre-training strategies with data from various modalities and sources. Currently, weakly supervised
pre-training from web-scale text supervision has become the core of multi-modal understanding,
but existing methods have not yet to leverage the most widespread interleaved image-text data for
training visual representation from scratch.
Interleaved Image-Text Incremental Pre-training. Training using Interleaved Image-Text Data
(IITD) has recently garnered significant attention due to the vast amount of such data available online.
Recent works[ 87,68,69,23,4] such as Flamingo [ 2] and KOSMOS-1 [ 29] perform incremental
learning on non-public IITD based on previously pre-trained vision and language model parameters
as initialization, training text generation models with multi-modal understanding capabilities. With
the continuous advancement in the field and the proliferation of public IITD ( e.g., MMC4 [ 88]
and OBELICS [ 36]), numerous models [ 83,85,14] capable of multi-modal understanding have
emerged. However, these efforts only perform incremental pre-training on IITD and only analyze the
usage of IITD on multi-modal dialogue models. Whether IITD contributes to learning robust visual
representation from scratch remains unknown.
Compression Learning in NLP. The perspective [ 59,60] that compression is closely connected
to intelligence has a long history. A common compression method is arithmetic coding [ 56,52],
which is a practical approach that uses probability models for optimal data encoding. Some studies
[28,51,38,31,37] argue that compression and intelligence are fundamentally equivalent. With the
popularity of large language models, the equivalence of language modeling and compression has once
again drawn widespread attention, prompting numerous explorations. Recently, [ 18] demonstrated
through examples that language models serve as universal compressors. [ 30] posited that language
modeling is equivalent to compressing a dataset into model parameters and proposed that compression
efficiency is linearly related to model capabilities. Although compression learning has been proven
effective in the field of NLP, it is not clear whether this approach can be extended to other fields.
Multi-modal Large Models. Text supervision pre-trained vision models [ 55,32,40] are widely
utilized and have exhibited superior performance in tasks ranging from image retrieval and image
classification to captioning. Currently, the most popular and closely watched application area is multi-
modal dialogue. Multi-modal dialogue models [ 2,41,86,17,25,21,53] primarily rely on a powerful
pre-trained vision encoder [ 55,22] and text decoder [ 16,74,75]. The usage of pre-trained vision
encoder can generally be divided into two categories: the majority [ 2,72], represented by LLaV A
[46], employ a strategy where the pre-trained vision encoder is frozen, and only the subsequent
adapters and language models are trained. A minority, exemplified by Qwen-VL [ 5,53], utilize
high-quality image-text dialogue data to continue fine-tuning the vision model. These two training
strategies correspond to the two evaluation methods used in this paper to assess the performance of
vision models.
33 Method
3.1 Latent Compression Learning
Auto-regressive Language Modeling as Compression Learning. Recent works [ 18,30] have
shown that auto-regressive language modeling is equivalent to compression learning. Suppose
gϕis a language model (LM) with learnable parameters ϕ. Given an input text sequence
x= (</s>, x1, x2, . . . , x N), where </s> is a special token indicating the beginning of text,
the model outputs y=gϕ(x) = ( y1, y2, . . . , y N)predicting the next token based on preced-
ing context, i.e.,ˆxk=yk=gϕ(x)k. The approximate probability of xestimated by gϕis
q(x) =QN
k=1q(xk|yk=gϕ(x)k). The model is optimized with NLL-loss, which equals to mini-
mizing the the cross-entropy between the data distribution pand model distribution q:
H(p, q) =Ex∼p"
−NX
k=1logq(xk|yk=gϕ(x)k)#
. (1)
Notice that H(p, q)is actually the optimal expected code length encoding pbyq, minimizing H(p, q)
just means compressing the data into the model parameters.
Latent Compression for Interleaved Image-Text Data. We believe that the compression principle
could apply to multi-modal domain, specifically, to train vision-language models by compressing
interleaved image-text data. However, instead of directly dealing with pixel values, we turn to
compress high-level image representation for the following reasons: 1) high-level representation can
extract useful information from raw pixels while discarding those unpredictable image details. 2) the
learned visual representation will align with text semantics, making it possible to perform effective
visual pre-training with interleaved image-text data.
Specifically, let x= (</s>, x1, x2, . . . , x N)be an interleaved image-text sequence. To simplify
the expression without loss of generality, we assume that there is only one image in the sequence.
Sub-sequence xi:i+MareM+ 1 image patch tokens of the input image (e.g., non-overlapping
patches in ViTs) and others are text tokens. I={i, i+ 1, . . . , i +M}denotes the indices of the
image patches, and T={1, . . . , i −1, i+M+ 1. . . , N }denotes the indices of text tokens. As
shown in Fig. 2, to construct the sequence of latent representation z= (</s>, z1, z2, . . . , z N), for
image patches, we use a parametric vision encoder fθ(e.g., ViTs) to map the data sequence xi:i+M
into latent variable zi:i+M. For text tokens, we directly use one-hot vectors corresponding to their
vocabulary ids as the latent codes. Then, the latent representation zare fed into a causal attention
model gϕfor latent compression by minimizing
H(p, q) =−Z
p(z) logq(z) =Ex∼p"
−NX
k=1Z
p(zk|x) logq(zk|yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k)#
,(2)
where the k-th element of the output yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)kpredicts the next input latent zk,fθis identity
for text tokens for simplicity of annotation. When the compression only applied on text tokens, it
degenerates to auto-regressive language modeling on interleaved image-text data used by previous
methods (e.g., Kosmos and Flamingo).
However, direct optimizing Eq. (2)for learning informative latent representation is non-trivial, since
Eq.(2)suffers from a naturally trivial solution of visual representation collapse, i.e. the image latent
representation zi:i+Mmay be learned to be data-independent. In fact, as showed in Sec. 4.2, we have
observed such visual representation collapse, when training from scratch on MMC4 dataset with
Eq. (2) applied to text tokens only (i.e., auto-regressive language modeling).
Maximizing Mutual Information for Latent Compression Learning. Optimizing directly for
latent compression in Eq. (2)may cause the visual representation collapse. A natural constraint is to
maximize the representation entropy to prevent collapse. We find that combining latent compression
and maximum entropy constraint is exactly equivalent to maximizing the mutual information between
the model inputs and outputs.
Prior work [ 65] have shown the relationship between cross-entropy and mutual information in other
pre-training tasks. Here, we derive this relationship in the latent compression task: maximizing the
mutual information between the output yand the input latent zof the causal attention model gϕis
4equivalent to compressing zby minimizing H(p, q)in Eq. (2)meanwhile maximizing the entropy of
each element zkinz:
I(y;z) =Ex∼p"NX
k=1Z
p(yk|x)p(zk|x) logp(zk|yk)
p(zk)#

−NX
k=1Z
p(zk) logp(zk)
=−min
qH(p, q) +NX
k=1H(zk), (3)
where we use p(yk, zk|x) =p(yk|x)p(zk|x)in the first step since zkandykcan be independently
computed given input x, and p(zk|yk)is estimated by an approximate parameterized distribution
q(zk|yk). For the derivation of the formula, please refer to [65].
Therefore, using I(y;z)as the optimization objective can achieve latent compression while avoiding
representation collapse of zvia the maximum entropy constraint. The compression of zimposes the
model to extract useful information and discard unpredictable information of the image. Meanwhile,
maximizing I(y;z)requires that each ykcould obtain enough information from previous latent
z<kto predict zk. Each zkshould carry predictable information. These guarantee that the image
representation encode rich semantic information aligned with text. We suppose that the above
properties learned by the image representation are desired for vision-language pre-training , thus
we use Eq. (3)as our pre-training objective. Parameters ϕandθare be jointly optimized under this
objective. Intuitively, the vision encoder fθlearns to represent images by high-level abstract, and the
causal attention model gϕlearns to compress this high-level abstract of the dataset.
3.2 Training Loss
In this sub-section, we demonstrate how Eq. (3)is decomposed into training tasks and losses.
Firstly, I(y;z)can be decomposed as a cross-entropy term and an entropy term in the following two
symmetric ways (see Appendix B for detailed derivation):
I(y;z) =NX
k=1−min
q1Ex∼p[H(δ[zk=fθ(x)k], q1(zk|yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k))] + H(zk),(4)
I(y;z) =NX
k=1−min
q2Ex∼p[H(δ[yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k], q2(yk|zk=fθ(x)k))] + H(yk).(5)
Since given the input x, latent zkandykare independent and deterministic ( i.e., determined by fθ
andgϕ), yielding p(yk, zk|x) =δ[zk=fθ(x)k]·δ[yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k].δ[·]is delta distribution. In
Eq.(4),p(zk|yk)is estimated by a parameterized distribution q1(zk|yk), which approximates the
distribution of zkgiven the model’s prediction yk. Similarly, in Eq. (5),p(yk|zk)is estimated by
q2(yk|zk), the predicted distribution of ykgiven zk. Therefore, maximizing mutual information
can be decomposed as follows: 1) The causal attention model gϕlearns to predict the next latent
zkfrom the output yk. 2) The learnable latent representation zklearns to predict yk, which is the
representation of its previous context. 3) The maximum entropy regularization avoids the collapse of
zkandyk.
In the following, we show that the cross-entropy terms in I(y;z)can be achieved by two common
training tasks and loss functions, while the entropy constraints are implicitly satisfied.
Contrastive Learning between Image Representation and Preceding Context. For image la-
tentzkand the corresponding ykrepresenting the semantics of its preceding context, the objec-
tive defines a bidirectional prediction. We choose qas Boltzmann distribution, i.e.,q(zk|yk)∝
exp(z⊤
kW⊤
1W2yk/τ)andq(yk|zk)∝exp(y⊤
kW⊤
2W1zk/τ), where τis the temperature, W1and
W2are learnable linear projections. Consequently, the objective becomes the contrastive loss in two
directions between zkandyk, when setting zk′andyk′from other images as negative samples:
Lcon=−X
k∈Ilogexp(y⊤
kW⊤
2W1zk/τ)P
k′exp(y⊤
kW⊤
2W1zk′/τ)−X
k∈Ilogexp(z⊤
kW⊤
1W2yk/τ)P
k′exp(z⊤

Image latent representation is extracted via a vision encoder and subsequently input into a language
model alongside textual embedding. Two complementary losses are utilized to learn robust visual
representation from scratch on interleaved image-text data: a contrastive loss ensures consistency
between the visual latent representation and its preceding context, while an auto-regressive loss
enhances the predictability of visual representation for subsequent text.
Meanwhile, the contrastive loss also prevents zkandykfrom being trivial representation by pulling
them away from negative samples, implicitly appending the entropy regularization.
Auto-regressive Text Generation. For a text token, its latent code zkis a one-hot vector and is
not learnable, so the objective only imposes ykto predict zkas in Eq. (4). We choose q(zk|yk)as
softmax over the output logits on the text vocabulary, i.e, q(zk|yk) =z⊤
ksoftmax (V yk), where Vis
the projection head of the language model. The objective corresponding to the text tokens is simply
the objective of standard next token prediction with cross-entropy loss:
Lgen=−X
k∈Tlogz⊤
ksoftmax (V yk) (7)
The total training loss is defined as L=λLcon+Lgen, where λis balancing weight.
Relation to Previous Pre-training Tasks. In our proposed pre-training framework, the contrastive
task and generation task align the image representation with preceding context and subsequent
context, respectively. Hence, combining these two pre-training tasks can fully leverage the semantic
information contained in interleaved image-text data to supervise the learning of image representation.
For previous pre-training tasks, 1) Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) [55] has a
similar objective of maximizing the mutual information between corresponding image and text [ 65],
but it can only be applied to paired image-text data. 2) Contrastive Captioner (CoCa) [81] combines
a captioning (text generation) loss with the CLIP loss, but it cannot be applied to interleaved data,
either. CLIP loss requires image-text pairs, while the captioner can only be conditioned on a single
image can rather than flexible interleaved image-text contents. 3) Auto-regressive Text Generation
task only leverages the semantic information in subsequent context to supervise the learning of image
representation, while the preceding context is missing, and representation collapse cannot be avoided.
Moreover, interleaved image-text data usually has information redundancy, i.e., the image and its
corresponding text may contain similar information. So models may rely on information from the text
rather than the image for prediction. This is particularly true when the vision encoder is trained from
scratch, resulting that the image representation are never focused and optimized. Our experiments in
Sec. 4.2 confirms this analyze.
3.3 Architecture
The overview of model architecture when adopting our LCL is shown in Fig. 2. The interleaved
image-text input sequence may contain multiple images. We adopt a Vision Transformer (ViT) [ 20]
as the vision encoder, which encodes each image into a sequence of visual embeddings as its latent
representation. The visual embeddings of each image are inserted at corresponding positions in the
6interleaved sequence, and we introduce special tokens <BoI> and<EoI> to indicate the beginning
and the ending positions, respectively. The combined visual and text embeddings are fed into a causal
language model. The text generation loss is the standard cross-entropy loss over the output logits of
the language model defined in Eq. (7). In the contrastive learning task, calculating the loss for each
image token is extremely computationally expensive. To alleviate this problem, we consider utilizing
one global representation per image instead of all latent representation for contrastive learning.
Specifically, the global representation viof each image is extracted from its latent representation
zi:i+Mthrough an attention pooling, which is a multi-head attention layer with a learnable query
token. The output of the causal transformer model at <BoI> token, just before the image, is processed
by a LayerNorm layer and a linear projection into ti. The contrastive loss in Eq. (6)is calculated
between viandti.
4 Experiment
4.1 Experiment Settings
Pre-train Data. The datasets utilized in our pre-training encompass the image-text pair dataset
LAION-400M [ 57], as well as the image-text interleaved datasets MMC4 [ 88] and OBELICS [ 36].
We also re-organize two datasets for fair comparison with CLIP. 1) LAION-Random as a interleaved
dataset. Images from LAION-400M are randomly placed before or after their paired caption to
form image-text sequences. 2) MMC4-Pair as a paired dataset. For images in MMC4, we select
matching text from the bipartite graph matching results derived from CLIP similarity to generate
pseudo image-text paired data.
Implementation Details. We adopt the same image transform in OpenCLIP [ 15] for pre-training
and set the image size as 224×224for all experiments. We employ ViT [20] as our vision encoder.
ViT-L/14 is used for the main results, and ViT-B/16 is used for ablation studies. The language
model follows the same architecture as OPT-125M [ 84] but is randomly initialized. By default, the
contrastive loss balancing weight is set at λ= 0.1. AdamW optimizer with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.95and
a weight decay of 0.1 are used. We employ a cosine learning rate schedule with linear warmup and
set the peak learning rate at 5e-4 for the LAION data and 3e-4 for others. The model for the main
results is trained for 200k iterations with 64k images per batch on average. In the ablation study, the
models are trained for 250k iterations with 8k images per batch.
Vision Encoder Evaluation. CLIP pre-trained models typically uses zero-shot retrieval performance
for evaluation. However such zero-shot inference on retrieval tasks [ 55] is not suitable for other
generative pre-training methods. To address this discrepancy, we choose to evaluate pre-trained vision
models by transfer learning on various downstream tasks under two configurations: “frozen transfer”
and “full transfer”. In the frozen transfer setting, only the parameters outside of the vision model are
trained. In the full transfer setting, all parameters are trained.
The evaluation is conducted on image classification, image-text retrieval, image caption, and multi-
modal dialogue. Please see Appendix A for more data, implementation, and evaluation details.
4.2 Comparison with Vision Pre-training Methods
In this section, we show the superiority of our LCL when using interleaved image-text data for vision
pre-training. However, existing vision pre-training methods only support paired data, so we choose
MMC4 dataset with a paired set (MMC4-Pair) available for those methods. In addition, to confirm
that it is is not trivial to use interleaved data for vision pre-training, we also consider existing methods
to use interleaved data. Those methods are originally proposed as MLLM training methods, but here
we test them for vision pre-training. Besides, on paired image-text data, we also compare our LCL
with existing vision pre-training methods and show they are comparable. See Appendix A.3 and A.2
for detailed pre-training and evaluation settings.
We aggregate all the pre-training methods divide them into the following tasks: (1) Image-text
contrastive (Con.) [ 55,15,32], (2) Image-text contrastive + image captioning (Con. + Cap.) [ 81], (3)
Image-text contrastive + image captioning + image-text matching (Con. + Cap. + Mat.) [ 40,41,14],
(4) Auto-regressive text generation (Gen.) [ 2,29,44], (5) Auto-regressive text generation + image
regression (Gen. + Reg.) [ 69,68,72], (6) Mask data modeling (Mask.) [ 78]. We select one

representative method from each task. For fair comparison, we implement these methods on the same
model and training data with available open-source codes or our reproduction.
Pre-training on Interleaved Image-Text Data. We conduct experiments on the MMC4 dataset [ 88]
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our LCL on interleaved image-text data. For pre-training methods
that only support paired data, MMC4-Pair is used.
The results are shown in Tab. 1. Our LCL pre-training method significantly outperforms all other
methods in the caption tasks, indicating that we can effectively utilize the rich text context information
in MMC4 interleaved data. On the other hand, our method is on par with the best paired pre-training
methods on classification and retrieval tasks. Since the paired pre-training methods are directly
optimized for retrieval, our comparable performance shows that the visual features are learned to be
highly distinguishable. It is worth mentioning that for more general interleaved data, where no paired
versions exist, these paired pre-training methods cannot be applied.
In addition, we observed that the two methods using auto-regressive text generation do not achieve
good performance and feature collapse occurs. However, their text prediction training loss is actually
close to ours. This suggests that these methods tend to rely on redundant text information rather than
image information for subsequent text prediction. As discussed in Sec. 3.1, our approach can avoid
such collapse.
Pre-training on Paired Image-Text Data. We conduct experiments on the LAION-400M dataset to
show that LCL pre-training also performs well on paired image-text data without specific modification.
Tab 2 shows that our method is comparable to paired pre-training methods on various tasks, indicating
that all information in paired data is fully exploited.

4.3 Comparison with Pre-trained Checkpoints
To further confirm the effectiveness of our proposed Latent Compression Learning (LCL), we compare
our pre-trained model with existing checkpoints of pre-trained vision encoders. We use LCL to
pre-train a ViT-L/14 with mixed data from the LAION-400M and MMC4. We compare it to the
ViT-L/14 pre-trained by OpenCLIP [ 15] using the public LAION-400M dataset, and the ViT-L/14
pre-trained by OpenAI CLIP [ 55] with private data is listed as reference. The total number of images
seen during pre-training is 13B for all models. We evaluate the pre-trained vision encoders by
transferring to downstream tasks, i.e., integrate the vision encoders into downstream task models and
compare the fine-tuning results. More training details are in Appendix A.1 and evaluation details are
in Appendix A.2.
Tab. 3 and Tab. 4 show the results of transfer evaluations. When both use LAION-400M as pre-
training data, as with the previous experimental conclusions, LCL has similar performance to CLIP.
When combined with MMC4, our method achieves better performance, especially on caption and
multi-modal dialogue tasks.
There exist approaches achieving better results on some benchmarks. However, they either use larger
vision encoders, more training data, or private data. We list those results as reference in Appendix C.
4.4 Ablation Study
Latent Compression Learning on Different Datasets. We apply LCL pre-training to more datasets
to confirm its generalizability. As shown in Tab. 5, our method also achieves reasonable performance
on interleaved dataset OBELICS. It is worth noting that the models trained on MMC4 and OBELICS
have achieved similar performance to that on LAION, indicating that it is completely feasible to
pre-train visual models only from interleaved data. Furthermore, using both LAION and MMC4 data
during pre-training improves performance, suggesting that further improvements can be obtained by
incorporating more image-text data. In this case, supporting interleaved data is a key advantage of
our approach, enabling the use of more diverse image-text data for pre-training.

all entries had seen the same number of images during pre-training to ensure fairness.

Loss Balance in Latent Compression Learning. Table 6a ablates the contrastive loss and generation
loss used in LCL . Consistent with the previous analyses, LCL can achieve the best performance.
Table 6b studies the appropriate loss balancing weights (multiplied by the contrastive loss). It turns
out that λ= 0.1will produce the best results. The performance drops significantly for larger λvalues,
indicating that the optimization directions of the two losses are not completely consistent.
5 Conclusion
No existing work has explored vision model pre-training with interleaved image-text data. To this end,
we propose Latent Compression Learning (LCL) framework that compresses interleaved image-text
latent for vision pre-training. We theoretically show that latent compression is equivalent to maximiz-
ing the mutual information between the input and output of a causal model and further decompose
this objective into two basic training tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our method is comparable
to CLIP on paired pre-training datasets, and it effectively learns robust visual representations utilizing
interleaved image-text data. Our work showcases the effectiveness of using interleaved image-text
data to learn robust visual representation from scratch, and confirms the potential of compression
learning for visual pre-training.
Limitations . Our experiments are constrained to a limited size of dataset and vision encoder, and the
scaling property of our proposed method remains unexplored.

Information Processing Systems , 36, 2024.
15A Experimental Details
A.1 Pre-training
Data. For the data in MMC4, we select images with a CLIP similarity to the matching text of 0.24 or
higher. From documents containing at least one such image, we randomly choose up to 6 images
to form an interleaved image-text sequence, utilizing all text from that document. If the sequence
length exceeds 2048 tokens, the surplus is truncated while ensuring the integrity of both images and
individual text segments, and then padded to the designated length. For OBELICS, we similarly
restrict the number of images per document to between 1 and 6. We then sequentially extract 2048
tokens from the concatenated documents. If image tokens are truncated, the entire image is moved to
the next sample sequence.
To construct interleaved image-text samples from the MMC4 dataset, we randomly place images
either before or after their corresponding sentences, adhering to a 50% probability, thus generating
a document-wise interleaved sequence of images and text. For the OBELICS corpus, individual
documents are concatenated, and a sliding window strategy is employed to select each image-text
sequence, maintaining a total length of 2048 tokens.
Hyper-parameters. Our pre-training configuration is shown in Tab. 7. The AdamW optimizer was
employed for model training with the learning rate set to 3e-4 and the weight decay set to 0.1. Mixed
numerical precision training with bfloat16 is also employed to stabilize the optimization process.
Furthermore, we set a drop-path [ 35] rate linearly increasing to 0.2, and use layer-scale [ 73] for stable
training.

A.2 Evaluation
Transfer Tasks. We conduct our performance evaluation of pre-trained on image classification,
image-text retrieval, text generation tasks with multimodal inputs ( i.e., image captioning and multi-
modal dialogue). Their model architecture in transfer learning are illustrated in Fig. 3.
For closed-set image classification, a lightweight classifier with a randomly initialized attention
pooling layer, followed by a layer normalization layer and a linear layer, is appended to the top of the
pre-trained vision model. In the “frozen transfer” scenario, only the parameters of the added classifier
are trainable, similar to the linear probing strategy. Conversely, in the “full transfer” approach, all
parameters, including those of the pre-trained vision encoder, are adjustable.
Regarding the image-text retrieval task, we discard the pre-trained text encoder and apply contrastive
learning to the pretrained vision encoder with a newly introduced text encoder. Images are processed
through the vision encoder and a randomly initialized attention pooling layer to generate a global
image embedding. Textual captions are processed through the text encoder, utilizing the feature of the
final token as the text embedding representing the input caption. An additional linear layer facilitates
the dimensional alignment between the image and text embeddings, enabling their use in contrastive
learning. During “frozen transfer”, the attention pooling layer on the vision transformer and the text
encoder are trainable; similarly, in “full transfer”, all parameters, including the vision encoder, can be
optimized.

encoder. (b) Image-text retrieval: an attention probe is used to extract global visual feature, which is
trained to align with the text feature from the text encoder. (c) Text generation: an MLP is utilized to
align the visual feature with the text embedding space, and the multi-modal embedding is fed into the
language model for auto-regressive text generation.
For text generation tasks with multimodal inputs, we adopt image captioning and multi-modal
dialogue benchmarks and employ prevalent architectures like those in [ 46]. Specifically, a pretrained
LLM for text generation is integrated on top of the pre-trained vision model, incorporating an MLP
layer to adjust the dimensions of the visual embeddings. During the “frozen transfer” evaluation, the
parameters of the vision model remain fixed, while in the ‘unfreezing’ phase, these parameters are
permitted to undergo training.
Implementation Details. Vision encoder evaluation with “frozen transfer” and “full transfer” con-
figurations includes fine-tuning training and benchmark evaluation. Implementation details of each
transfer task are list below, and the hyper-parameters involved are listed in Tab. 8.
•Image classification. Model is trained on the ImageNet-1K [ 33]train split and evaluated on val
split. We follow the attention probe setting introduced by [ 12] for “frozen transfer”, and the full
fine-tune setting in [43] for “full transfer”.
•Image-text retrieval. Model is trained on a combination dataset comprised of CC12M [ 61],
CC3M [ 61], and SBU [ 77], and is tested on the MSCOCO [ 11]karpathy-test split and
Flickr30k [ 54]testsplit. The model is trained with Adamw optimizer for 5000 iterations. The
learning rate is set at 1e-3 and 1e-5 for parameters without initialization and with initialization,
respectively.
•Image captioning. Model is trained on a subset of the LAION-COCO [ 58] dataset, which includes
10 million samples, and evaluation is performed on the MSCOCO [ 11]karpathy-test split and
NoCaps [ 1]valsplit. Here, the model is trained for 20,000 iterations with a learning rate of 1e-4.
Additionally, a droppath technique is employed with a ratio of 0.2 in the vision model to mitigate
overfitting.
•Multi-modal dialogue. We follow a two-stage training process similar to that used in LLA V A-
1.5 [ 45]. Initially, paired data with 558K samples is used to train an MLP projector to align the
Vision Transformer (ViT) with the pretrained LLM. Subsequently, the model undergoes instruction
tuning on multimodal dialogue datasets with 665k samples. Both the alignment training and
instruction tuning phases are conducted over a single epoch, with learning rates set at 1e-3 and
2e-5, respectively. Evaluations are then performed on multimodal dialogue benchmark, e.g.,
MMBench [47] and VQAv2 [26].
A.3 Ablation Experiments
The effectiveness of our LCL are validated by conducting ablation experiments mainly on two corpora:
LAION and MMC4. The experimental hyper-parameters involved are shown in Tab. 9. We found that
the optimal learning rate for the LAION dataset is 5e-4, while for the MMC4 dataset, a slightly lower

rate of 3e-4 proves most effective. We speculate that this is because MMC4 corpus contains relatively
higher noise. Most of the original settings in the large-scale pre-training are retained in the ablation,
with the exception of reducing the batch size by a factor of 8 to decrease the computational overhead.

B Theoretical derivation details
Using the notation defined in Sec. 3, the mutual information of the output of the language model ( y)
and the latent representation ( z) can be described as follows:
I(y;z) =NX
k=1I(yk;zk)
=NX
k=1Z
p(yk, zk) logp(yk, zk)
p(yk)p(zk)dykdzk (8)
=NX
k=1Ex∼pZ
p(yk|x)p(zk|x) logp(yk, zk)
p(yk)p(zk)dykdzk
(9)
We can derive Eq. 9 from Eq. 8 because once the interleaved image-text input sequence xis given,
the output ykand the latent representation zkcan be computed independently:
p(yk, zk|x) =p(yk|x)p(zk|x)
18From Eq. 9, we can further decompose the mutual information into a cross-entropy component and
an entropy component in two symmetric ways. One approach involves the output token ykpredicting
the next latent representation zk, along with the entropy of zk:
I(y;z) =NX
k=1Ex∼pZ
p(yk|x)p(zk|x) logp(zk|yk)
p(zk)dykdzk
(10)
=X
kEx∼p[δ(zk=fθ(x)k) logP(zk|yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k)]−Z
p(zk) logp(zk)(11)
The other approach considers how the latent representation zkapproximates the previous context yk
and includes the entropy of the output yk:
I(y;z) =NX
k=1Ex∼pZ
p(yk|x)p(zk|x) logp(yk|zk)
p(yk)dykdzk
(12)
=NX
k=1Ex∼p[δ(yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k) logP(yk|zk=fθ(x)k)]−Z
p(yk) logp(yk)(13)
Note that the reason for transitioning from Eq. 10 to Eq. 11 and from Eq. 12 to Eq. 13 is because,
given the input sequence x, the outputs ykandzkare determined as follows:
p(yk|x) =δ[yk=gϕ◦fθ(x)k]
p(zk|x) =δ[zk=fθ(x)k]
C Supplementary Benchmark Results
We present supplementary results on classification, retrieval and captioning tasks (Tab. 10) and
multi-modal benchmarks (Tab. 11).
D Broader Impacts
This work may share the common negative impacts of large-scale vision training. The data used in pre-
training may contain dataset bias, and raise ethical concerns. It may also require large computational
resources, which consume lots of electricity and result in increased carbon emissions.

21NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Sec 1.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Sec 5.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
22Justification: Please see Sec 3.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Details of pre-training and evaluation can be found in 4.1 and Appendix A
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
23Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The code has been released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LCL . Only
pulic datasets have been used in our research.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix A.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Most experiments have stable results with little variance.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
24•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix A.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix D.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
25•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not release a novel dataset or model.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the original paper each time a new asset appears.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
26•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
