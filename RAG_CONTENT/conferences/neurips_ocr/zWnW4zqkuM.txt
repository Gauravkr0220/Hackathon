Abstract
In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image : gen-
erating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses
significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among
graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address
these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called
INSTRUCT G2I.INSTRUCT G2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal
information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized
page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-
QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of
graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose
graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the
strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate
the effectiveness and controllability of our approach. The code is available at
https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/InstructG2I .
1 Introduction
This paper investigates an overlooked yet critical source of information for image generation: the
pervasive graph-structured relationships of real-world entities. In contrast to the commonly adopted
language conditioning in models represented by Stable Diffusion [ 32], graph connections have
combinatorial complexity and cannot be trivially captured as a sequence. Such graph-structured
relationships among the entities are expressed through “ Multimodal Attributed Graphs ” (MMAGs),
where nodes are enriched with image and text information. As a concrete example (Figure 1(a)),
the graph of artworks is constructed by nodes containing images (pictures) and texts (titles), as well
as edges corresponding to shared genre and authorship. Such a graph uniquely depicts a piece of
artwork by its thousands of peers in the graph, beyond the mere description of language.
To this end, we formulate and propose the Graph2Image challenge, requiring the generative models
to synthesize image conditioning on both text descriptions and graph connections of a node. This task
featuring the image generation on MMAGs is well-grounded in real-world applications. For instance,
generating an image for a virtual artwork node in the art MMAG is akin to creating virtual artwork
according to the nuanced styles of artists and genres [ 5] (as in Figure 1(a)). Similarly, generating an
image for a product node connected to other products through co-purchase links in an e-commerce
MMAG equates to recommending future products for users [ 24]. Without surprise, our exploiting
the graph-structured information indeed improves the consistency of generated images compared to
models only using texts or images as conditioning (Figure 1(b)).

……Figure 1: We propose a new task Graph2Image featuring image synthesis by conditioning on
graph information and introduce a novel graph-conditioned diffusion model called INSTRUCT G2I
to tackle this problem. (a) Graph2Image is supported by prevalent multimodal attributed graphs
and is grounded in real-world applications, e.g., virtual artistry. (b) INSTRUCT G2I outperforms
baseline image generation techniques, demonstrating the usefulness of graph information. (c) To
accommodate realistic user queries, INSTRUCT G2I exhibits smooth controllability in utilizing
text/graph information and managing the strength of multiple graph edges.
Despite the usefulness of graph information, existing methods conditioning on either text [ 32] or
images [ 2,41] are incapable of direct integration with MMAGs. Therefore, we propose a graph
context-aware diffusion model INSTRUCT G2I inherited from Stable Diffusion that mitigates gaps. A
most prominent challenge directly originates from the combinatorial complexity of graphs, which we
term as Graph Size Explosion : inputting the entire local subgraph structure to a model, including all
the images and texts, is impractical due to the exponential increase in size, especially with additional
hops. Therefore, INSTRUCT G2I learns to compress the massive amounts of contexts from the
graph into a set of graph conditioning tokens with fixed capacity, which functions alongside the
common text conditioning tokens in Stable Diffusion. Such a compression process is enhanced
with a semantic personalized pagerank-based graph sampling approach to actively select the most
informative neighboring nodes based on both structural and semantic perspectives.
Besides the number of contexts, the graph structures in MMAGs additionally specify the proximity of
entities, which is not captured in conventional text or image conditioning. This challenge of “ Graph
Entity Dependency ” reflects the implicit preference of image generation: synthesizing a shirt image
linked to “light-colored” clothing is likely to have a “pastel tone” (image-image dependency), and
generating a picture titled “a running horse” should reference interconnected animal images rather
than scenic ones (text-image dependency). To enable the nuanced proximity understanding on graphs,
we further improve our graph conditioning tokens via a Graph-QFormer architecture learning to
encode the graph information guided by texts.
Finally, we propose that our graph conditioning is a natural interface for controllable generation,
reflecting the strength of edges in MMAGs. Take the virtual art generation (Figure 1(c)) for example:
INSTRUCT G2I can flexibly offer different strengths of graph guidance and can smoothly transition
between the style of Monet and Kandinsky, defined by its strength of connection with either of the
two artists. Such an advantage is grounded for real-world application and is a plug-and-play test-time
algorithm inspired by classifier-free guidance [18]. In sum, our contributions include:
•Formulation and Benchmark . We are the first to identify the usefulness of multimodal attributed
graphs (MMAGs) in image synthesis and formulate the Graph2Image problem. Our formulation is
supported by three benchmarks grounded in the real-world applications of art and e-commerce.
•Algorithm . Methodologically, we propose INSTRUCT G2I, a context-aware diffusion model that ef-
fectively encodes graph conditional information as graph prompts for controllable image generation
(as shown in Figure 1(b,c)).
2•Experiments and Evaluation . Empirically, we conduct experiments on graphs from three different
domains, demonstrating that INSTRUCT G2I consistently outperforms competitive baselines (as
shown in Figure 1(b)).
2 Problem Formulation
2.1 Multimodal Attributed Graphs
Definition 1 (Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs)) A multimodal attributed graph can be defined
asG“pV,E,P,Dq, where V,E,PandDrepresent the sets of nodes, edges, images, and documents,
respectively. Each node viPVis associated with some textual information dviPDand some image
information pviPP.
For example, in an e-commerce product graph, nodes ( vPV) represent products, edges ( ePE)
denote co-viewed semantic relationships, images ( pPP) are product images, and documents ( dPD)
are product titles. Similarly, in an art graph (shown in Figure 1), nodes represent artworks, edges
signify shared artists or genres, images are artwork pictures, and documents are artwork titles.
In this work, we focus on graphs where edges provide semantic correlations between images (nodes).
For instance, in an e-commerce product graph, connected products (those frequently co-viewed by
many users) are highly related. Similarly, in an art graph, linked artworks (those created by the same
author or within the same genre) are likely to have similar styles.
2.2 Problem Definition
In this work, we explore the problem of node image generation on MMAGs. Given a node viin an
MMAG G, our objective is to generate pvibased on dviandG. This problem has multiple real-world
applications. For example, in e-commerce, it translates to generating the image ( pvi) for a product
(vi) based on a user query ( dvi) and user purchase history ( G), which is a generative retrieval task. In
the art domain, it involves generating the picture ( pvi) for an artwork ( vi) based on its title ( di) and
its associated artist style or genre ( G), which is a virtual artwork creation task.
Definition 2 (Node Image Generation on MMAGs) In a multimodal attributed graph G“
pV,E,P,Dq, given a node viPVwithin the graph Gwith a textual description dvi, the goal is
to synthesize pvi, the corresponding image at vi, with a learned model ˆpvi“fpvi, dvi,Gq.
Our evaluation emphasizes instance-level similarity, assessing how closely ˆpvimatches pvi. We
conduct evaluations on artwork graphs, e-commerce graphs, and literature graphs. More details can
be found in Section 4.1.
3 Methodology
In this section, we present our INSTRUCT G2I framework, overviewed in Figure 2. We begin
by introducing graph conditions into stable diffusion models in Section 3.1. Next, we discuss
semantic personalized PageRank-based sampling to select informative graph conditions in Section
3.2. Furthermore, we propose Graph-QFormer to extract dependency-aware representations for graph
conditions in Section 3.3. Finally, we introduce controllable generation to balance the condition scale
between text and graph guidance, as well as manage multiple graph guidances in Section 3.4.
3.1 Graph Context-aware Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion (SD). INSTRUCT G2I is built upon Stable Diffusion (SD). SD conducts diffusion in
the latent space, where an input image xis first encoded from pixel space into a latent representation
z“Encpxq. A decoder then transfers the latent representation z1back to the pixel space, yielding
x1“Decpz1q. The diffusion model generates the latent representation z1conditioned on a text prompt
cT. The training objective of SD is defined as follows:

(e.g.,House in Snow ) in a Multimodal Attributed Graph (MMAG) for which we want to generate
an image, (b) we first perform semantic PPR-based neighbor sampling, which involves structure-
aware personalized PageRank and semantic-aware similarity-based reranking to sample informative
neighboring nodes in the graph. (c) These neighboring nodes are then inputted into a Graph-QFormer,
encoded by multiple self-attention and cross-attention layers, represented as graph tokens and used to
guide the denoising process of the diffusion model, together with text prompt tokens.
At each timestep t, the denoising network ϵθp¨qpredicts the noise by conditioning on the current
latent representation zt, timestep tand text prompt vectors hpcTq. To compute hpcTqPRdˆlcT,
where lcTis the length of cTanddis the hidden dimension, the text prompt cTis processed by the
CLIP text encoder [31]: hpcTq“CLIPpcTq.
Introducing Graph Conditions into SD. In the context of MMAGs, synthesizing the image for a
node viinvolves not only the text dvi, but also the semantic information from the node’s proximity
on the graph. Therefore, we introduce an auxiliary set of graph conditioning tokens hGpcGqto the
SD models (as shown in Figure 2(c)), working in parallel with the existing text conditions hTpcTq.

. (3)
ForhTpcTq, we can directly use the CLIP text encoder as in the original SD. However, determining
cGandhGp¨qis more complex. We will discuss the details of cGandhGp¨qin the following sections.
3.2 Semantic PPR-based Neighbor Sampling
A straightforward approach to developing cGpviqinvolves using the entire local subgraph of vi.
However, this is impractical due to the exponential growth in size with each additional hop, leading
to excessively long context sequences. To address this, we leverage both graph structure and node
semantics to select informative cG.
Structure Proximity: Personalized PageRank (PPR) . Inspired by [ 10], we first adopt PPR [ 15]
to identify related nodes from a graph structure perspective. PPR processes the graph structure to
derive a ranking score Pi,jfor each node vjrelative to node vi, where a higher Pi,jindicates a greater
degree of “similarity” between viandvj. LetPPRnˆnbe the PPR matrix of the graph, where each
rowPi,:represents a PPR vector toward a target node vi. The matrix Pis determined by:
P“βˆAP`p1´βqI. (4)
where βis the reset probability for PPR and ˆAis the normalized adjacency matrix. Once Pis
computed, we define the PPR-based graph condition cGpprof node vias the top- KpprPPR neighbors
of node vi:
cGpprpviq“ argmax
cGpprpviqĂV,|cGpprpviq|“Kpprÿ
vjPcGpprpviqPi,j. (5)
Semantic Proximity: Similarity-based Reranking . However, solely relying on PPR may result in a
graph condition set containing images ( e.g., scenery pictures) that are not semantically related to our
4target node ( e.g., a picture titled “running horse”). To address this, we propose using a semantic-based
similarity calculation function Simpd, pq(e.g., CLIP) to rerank vjPcGpprpviqbased on the relatedness
ofpvjtodvi. The final graph condition cGpviqis calculated by:
cGpviq“ argmax
cGpviqĂcGpprpviq,|cGpviq|“Kÿ
vjPcGpviqSimpdvi, pvjq. (6)
3.3 Graph Encoding with Text Conditions
After we derive cGpviqfrom the previous step, the problem comes to how can we design hGp¨qto
extract meaningful representations from cGpviq. Here we focus more on how to utilize the image
features from cGpviq(i.e.,tpvj|vjPcGpviqu) since we find they are more informative for viimage
generation compared with text features from cGpviq(i.e.,tdvj|vjPcGpviqu) (shown in Section 4.3).
Simple Baseline: Encoding with Pretrained Image Encoders [ 31].A straightforward way to
obtain representations for vjPcGpviqis to directly apply some pretrained image encoders gimgp¨q
(e.g., CLIP [31]):
hvj“gimgppvjqPRd, hGpcGpviqq“‘r hvjsvjPcGpviqPRdˆlcG, (7)
where‘denotes the concatenation operation. However, this simple design has two significant
limitations: 1) The encoding for each pvjpvjPcGpviqqis isolated from others in cGpviqand failed
to capture the image-image graph dependency. For example, the style extraction from one picture
(pvj) can benefit from the other pictures created by the same artist (in cGpviq). 2) The encoding for
eachpvjis independent to dvi, which fails to capture the text-image graph dependency. For example,
when we are creating a picture titled “running horse” ( dvi), it is desired to offer more weight on horse
pictures in cGpviqrather than scenery pictures.
Graph-QFormer. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-QFormer as hGp¨qto learn
representations for cGwhile considering the graph dependency information. As shown in Figure 2,
Graph-QFormer consists of two Transformer [ 35] modules motivated by [ 26]: (1) a self-attention
module that facilitates deep mutual information exchange between previous layer hidden states,
capturing image-image dependencies and (2) a cross-attention module that weights samples in cG
using text guidance, capturing text-image dependencies.
LetHptq

the token embeddings of dvias the input query embeddings to provide text guidance:

where xkis the k-th token embedding in dviandlcG“|dvi|. The multi-head self-attention layer

where q, k, v denotes query, key, and value channels in the Transformer. The output H1ptq

Connection between INSTRUCT G2I and GNNs. As illustrated in Figure 2, INSTRUCT G2I employs
a Transformer-based architecture as the graph encoder. However, it can also be interpreted as a Graph
Neural Network (GNN) model. GNN models [ 38] primarily use a propagation-aggregation paradigm
to obtain node representations ( Npiqdenotes the neighbor set of i):

Similarly, in INSTRUCT G2I, Eq.(4)(5)(6) can be regarded as the propagation function PROPplq,
while the aggregation step AGGplqcorresponds to the combination of Eq.(9) and Eq.(10).
53.4 Controllable Generation
The concept of classifier-free guidance, introduced by [ 18], enhances the performance of conditional
image synthesis by modifying the noise prediction, eθp¨q, with the output from an unconditional
model. This is formulated as: ˆϵθpzt, cq“ϵθpzt,∅q`s¨pϵθpzt, cq´ϵθpzt,∅qq, where spą1qis the
guidance scale. The intuition is that ϵθlearns the gradient of the log image distribution and increasing
the contribution of ϵθpcq´ϵθp∅qwill enlarge the convergence to the distribution conditioned on c.
In our task, the score network ˆϵθpzt, cG, cTqis conditioned on both text cT“diand the graph
condition cG. We compose the score estimates from these two conditions and introduce two guidance
scales, sTandsG, to control the contribution strength of cTandcGto the generated samples
respectively. Our modified score estimation function is:
ˆϵθpzt, cG, cTq“ϵθpzt,∅,∅q`sT¨pϵθpzt,∅, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅,∅qq
`sG¨pϵθpzt, cG, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅, cTqq. (11)
For cases requiring fine-grained control over multiple graph conditions ( i.e., different edges), we
extend the formula as follows:
ˆϵθpzt, cG, cTq“ϵθpzt,∅,∅q`sT¨pϵθpzt,∅, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅,∅qq
`ÿ
spkq
G¨pϵθpzt, cpkq
G, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅, cTqq, (12)
where cpkq
Gis the k-th graph condition. For example, to create an artwork that combines the styles of
Monet and Van Gogh, the neighboring artworks by Monet and Van Gogh on the graph would be cp1q
G
andcp2q
G, respectively. Further details on the derivation of our classifier-free guidance formulations
can be found in Appendix A.3.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setups
Datasets. We conduct experiments on three MMAGs from distinct domains: ART500K [ 27], Amazon
[16], and Goodreads [ 37]. ART500K is an artwork graph with nodes representing artworks and edges
indicating same-author or same-genre relationships. Each artwork node includes a title (text) and
a picture (image). Amazon is a product graph where nodes represent products and edges denote
co-view relationships. Each product is associated with a title (text) and a picture (image). Goodreads
is a literature graph where nodes represent books and edges convey similar-book semantics. Each
book node contains a title and a front cover image. Dataset statistics can be found in Appendix A.4.
Baselines. We compare INSTRUCT G2I with two groups of baselines: 1) Text-to-image methods:
This includes Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD-1.5) [ 32] and SD 1.5 fine-tuned on our datasets (SD-1.5 FT).
2) Image-to-image methods: This includes InstructPix2Pix [ 2] and ControlNet [ 41], both initialized
with SD 1.5 and fine-tuned on our datasets. We use the most relevant neighbor, as selected in Section
3.2 as the input image for these baselines, allowing them to partially utilize graph information.
Metrics. As indicated in Section 2.2, our evaluation mainly concerns the consistency of synthesized
images with the ground truth image on the node. Therefore, our evaluation adopts the CLIP [ 31]
and DINOv2 [ 29] score for instance-level similarity, in addition to the conventional FID [ 17] metric
for image generation. For the CLIP and DINOv2 scores, we utilize CLIP and DINOv2 to obtain
representations for both the generated and ground truth images and then calculate their cosine
similarity. For FID, we calculate the distance between the distribution of the ground truth images and
the distribution of the generated images.
4.2 Main results
Quantitative Evaluation. The quantitative results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 3. From
Table 1, we observe the following: 1) INSTRUCT G2I consistently outperforms all the base-
line methods, highlighting the importance of graph information in image synthesis on MMAGs.
2) Although InstructPix2Pix and ControlNet partially consider graph context, they fail to cap-
ture the semantic signals from the graph comprehensively. In Figure 3, we plot the aver-
6Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of different methods on ART500K, Amazon, and Goodreads datasets.
The CLIP score denotes the image-image score. INSTRUCT G2I significantly outperforms the best
baseline with p-value < 0.05 and consistently outperforms all the other common baselines in image
synthesis, supporting the benefits of graph conditioning.

Qualitative Evaluation. We conduct a qualitative evaluation
by randomly selecting some generated cases. The results are
shown in Figure 4, where we provide the sampled neighbor im-
ages from the graph, text prompts, and the ground truth images.
From these results, we observe that INSTRUCT G2I generates
images that best fit the semantics of the text prompt and context
from the graph. For instance, when generating a picture for
“the crater and the clouds”, the baselines either capture only
the content (“crater” and “clouds”) without the style learned
from the graph (Stable Diffusion and InstructPix2Pix) or adopt
a similar style but lose the desired content (ControlNet). In contrast, INSTRUCT G2I effectively learns
from the neighbors on the graph and conveys the content accurately.

4.3 Ablation Study
Study of Graph Condition for SD Variants. InINSTRUCT G2I, we introduce graph conditions into
SD by encoding the images from cGinto graph prompts, which serve as conditions together with
text prompts for SD’s denoising step. In this section, we demonstrate the significance of this design
by comparing it with other variants that utilize graph conditions in SD: InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) with
neighbor images and SD finetuned with neighbor texts. For the first variant, we perform mean pooling
on the latent representations of images in cG, according to the IP2P’s setting, and use this as the
input image representation for IP2P. This variant has the same input information as INSTRUCT G2I.
For the second variant, we utilize text information from neighbors instead of images, concatenate it
with the text prompt, and fine-tune the SD. The results are shown in Table 2, where INSTRUCT G2I
consistently outperforms both variants. This demonstrates the advantage of leveraging image features
from cGand the effectiveness of our model design.
Study of Graph-QFormer. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of Graph-QFormer by replacing it
with the simple baseline mentioned in Eq.(7), denoted as “- Graph-QFormer”. We then compare it
with graph neural network (GNN) baselines including GraphSAGE [ 13] and GAT [ 36], integrated
intoINSTRUCT G2I in the same manner. The results, presented in Table 2, show that INSTRUCT G2I
with Graph-QFormer consistently outperforms both the ablated version and GNN baselines. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph-QFormer design.
Study of the Semantic PPR-based Neighbor Sampling. We propose a semantic PPR-based
sampling method that combines structure and semantics for neighbor sampling on graphs, as detailed
in Section 3.2. In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by conducting
ablation studies that remove either or both components. The results, shown in Figure 5, indicate that
our sampling methods effectively identify neighbor images that contribute most significantly to the
ground truth in both semantics and style. This underscores the value of integrating both structural
and semantic information in our sampling approach.

text and graph conditions. To illustrate its effectiveness, we provide an example in Figure 6(a). The
results show that as text guidance increases, the generated image incorporates more of the desired
content. Conversely, as graph guidance increases, the generated image adopts a more desired style.
This demonstrates the ability of our method to balance content and style through controlled guidance.
Multiple Graph Guidance: Virtual Artist. In Eq.(12), we demonstrate how multiple graph
guidance can be managed for controllable image generation. We present a use case, virtual artwork
creation, to showcase its effectiveness (shown in Figure 6(b)). The goal of this task is to create an
image that depicts specific content ( e.g., a man playing piano) in the style of one or more artists ( e.g.,
Picasso and Courbet). This is akin to adding a new node to the graph that links to the artwork nodes
created by the specified artists and generating an image for this node. The results indicate that when
single graph guidance is provided, the generated artwork aligns with that artist’s style. As additional
graph guidance is introduced, the styles of the two artists blend together. This demonstrates that our
method offers the flexibility to meet various control requirements, effectively balancing different
types of graph influences.
4.5 Model Behavior Analysis
Cross-attention Weight Study in Graph-QFormer. We conduct a cross-attention study for Graph-
QFormer to understand how different sampled neighbors on the graph are selected based on the
text prompt and contribute to the final image generation. We randomly select a case with the text
prompt and neighbor images and plot the cross-attention weight map shown in Figure 7. From the
weight map, we can find that Graph-QFormer learns to assign higher weight to pictures 1 and 4
which are related to “raising” and “Lazarus” in the text prompt respectively. The results indicate that
Graph-QFormer effectively learns to select the images that are most relevant to the text prompt.

Diffusion Models. Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in generative applications. Diffusion models [ 4,7] generate compelling examples through a step-wise
denoising process, which involves a forward process that introduces noise into data distributions
and a reverse process that reconstructs the original data [ 19]. A notable example is the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) [32], which reduces computational costs by applying the diffusion process

in a low-resolution latent space. In the domain of diffusion models, various forms of conditioning are
employed to direct the generation process, including labels [ 6], classifiers [ 8], texts [ 28], images [ 2],
and scene graphs [ 39]. These conditions can be incorporated into diffusion models through latent
concatenation [ 33], cross-attention [ 1], and gradient control [ 12]. However, most existing works
neglect the relational information between images and cannot be directly applied to image synthesis
on MMAGs.
Learning on Graphs. Early studies on learning on graphs primarily focus on representation learning
for nodes or edges based on graph structures [ 3,14]. Methods such as Deepwalk [ 30] and Node2vec
[11] perform random walks on graphs to derive vector representation for each node. Graph neural
networks (GNNs) [ 38,43] are later introduced as a learnable component that incorporates both initial
node features and graph structure. GNNs have been applied to various tasks, including classification
[25], link prediction [ 42], and recommendation [ 21]. For instance, GraphSAGE [ 13] employs a
propagation and aggregation paradigm for node representation learning, while GAT [36] introduces
an attention mechanism into the aggregation process. Recently, research has increasingly focused on
integrating text or image features with graph structures [ 22,44]. For example, Patton [ 23] proposes
pretraining language models on text-attributed graphs. However, these existing works mainly target
representation learning on single-modal graphs and are not directly applicable to the image synthesis
from multimodal attributed graph (MMAG) task addressed in this paper.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we identify the problem of image synthesis on multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs).
To address this challenge, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model that: 1) Samples
related neighbors on the graph using a semantic personalized PageRank-based method; 2) Effectively
encodes graph information as graph prompts by considering their dependency with Graph-QFormer;
3) Generates images under control with graph classifier-free guidance. We conduct systematic
experiments on MMAGs in the domains of art, e-commerce, and literature, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach compared to competitive baseline methods. Extensive studies validate
the design of each component in INSTRUCT G2I and highlight its controllability. Future directions
include joint text and image generation on MMAGs and capturing the heterogeneous relations
between image and text units on MMAGs.

13A Appendix
A.1 Limitations
In this work, we focus on node image generation from multimodal attributed graphs, utilizing Stable
Diffusion 1.5 as the base model for INSTRUCT G2I. Due to computational constraints, we leave the
exploration of larger diffusion models, such as SDXL, for future work. Additionally, we model the
graph as homogeneous, not accounting for heterogeneous node and edge types. Considering that
different types of nodes and edges convey distinct semantics, future research could investigate how to
perform Graph2Image on heterogeneous graphs.
A.2 Ethical Considerations
While stable diffusion models [ 32] have demonstrated advanced image generation capabilities,
studies highlight several drawbacks, such as the uncontrollable generation of NSFW content [ 9],
vulnerability to adversarial attacks [ 45], and being computationally intensive and time-consuming
[34]. In INSTRUCT G2I, we address these challenges by introducing graph conditions into the image
generation process. However, since INSTRUCT G2I employs stable diffusion as the backbone model,
it remains susceptible to these limitations.
A.3 Classifier-free Guidance
In Section 3.4, we discuss controllable generation to balance text and graph guidances ( cTandcG) as
well as managing multiple graph guidances ( cpkq
G). We introduce sTandsGto control the strength
of text conditions and graph conditions and have the modified score estimation shown as follows
(copied from Eq.(11)):
ˆϵθpzt, cG, cTq“ϵθpzt,∅,∅q`sT¨pϵθpzt,∅, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅,∅qq
`sG¨pϵθpzt, cG, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅, cTqq.
In this section, we will provide mathematical derivation on how these modified score estimations
are developed. Noted that INSTRUCT G2I learns Ppz|cG, cTq, the distribution of image latents z
conditioned on text information cTand graph information cG, which can be expressed as:
Ppz|cG, cTq“Ppz, cG, cTq
PpcG, cTq“PpcG|cT,zqPpcT|zqPpzq
PpcG, cTq. (13)
INSTRUCT G2I learns and estimates the score [ 20] of the data distribution, which can also be
interpreted as the gradient of the log distribution probability. By taking a log on both sides of Eq.(13),
we can attain the following equation:
logpPpz|cG, cTqq“ logpPpcG|cT,zqq` logpPpcT|zqq` logpPpzqq´ logpPpcG, cTqq.(14)
After calculating the derivation on both sides of Eq.(14), we can obtain:
BlogpPpz|cG, cTqq
Bz“BlogpPpcG|cT,zqq
Bz`BlogpPpcT|zqq
Bz`BlogpPpzqq
Bz. (15)
This corresponds to our classifier-free guidance equation shown in Eq.(11), where sTcontrols how
the data distribution shifts toward the zone where PpcT|zqassigns a high likelihood to cTandsG
determines how the data distribution leans toward the region where PpcG|cT,zqassigns a high
likelihood to cG. Although there are other ways to derive the modified score estimation function ( e.g.,
switching cTandsGor making it symmetric), we empirically find that our derivation contributes to
both advanced performance (since PpcT|zqis well learned in the base model) and high efficiency
(since the denoising operation only needs to be conducted three times rather than four times compared
with symmetric setting).
If given multiple graph conditions, we utilize spkq
Gto control the strength for each of them and have
the derived score estimation function as follows (copied from Eq.(12)):
ˆϵθpzt, cG, cTq“ϵθpzt,∅,∅q`sT¨pϵθpzt,∅, cTq´ϵθpzt,∅,∅qq

A.4 Datasets
The statistics of the three datasets can be found in Table 3. Since Amazon and Goodreads both have
multiple domains, we select one from each of them considering the graph size: Beauty domain from
Amazon and Mystery domain from Goodreads.
A.5 Experimental Settings
We randomly mask 1,000 nodes as testing nodes from the graph for all three datasets and serve the
remaining nodes and edges as the training graph.
In implementing INSTRUCT G2I, we initialize the text encoder and U-Net with the pretrained pa-
rameters from Stable Diffusion 1.51. We use the pretrained CLIP image encoder as our fixed
image encoder to extract features from raw images. For Graph-QFormer, we empirically find that
initializing it with the CLIP text encoder parameters can improve performance compared with random
initialization.
1https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
15We use AdamW as the optimizer to train INSTRUCT G2I. The training of all methods including
INSTRUCT G2I and baselines on ART500K and Amazon are conducted on two A6000 GPUs, while
that on Goodreads is performed on four A40 GPUs. Each image is encoded as four feature vectors
with the fixed image encoder following [ 40] and we insert one cross-encoder layer after every two
self-attention layers in Graph-QFormer following [ 26]. The detailed hyperparameters are in Table 4.
16NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The contributions and scope is reflected in the abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of this work in the conclusion section and Appendix
section A.1.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
17Justification: The theoretical derivation of controllable generation is shown in Appendix
A.3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the code at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/
InstructG2I .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
18Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the code at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/
InstructG2I .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Detailed experimental settings are discussed in Appendix A.5.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the p-value in section 4.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
19•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The compute resources information is given in Appendix A.5.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We strictly follow the code of ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This is discussed in Appendix A.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
20•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The licenses for the assets are discussed in Appendix A.4.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
21•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The license is provided together with the code in https://github.com/
PeterGriffinJin/InstructG2I .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
