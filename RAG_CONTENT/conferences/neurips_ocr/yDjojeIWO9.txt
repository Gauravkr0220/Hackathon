Abstract
The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning
downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized
knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of
adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial
attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model
(SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast
to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of
adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to
train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial
attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal
meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in
the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the
generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient dif-
ference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned
downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the
adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature
embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust
loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmenta-
tion to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this
deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust
adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models. Code

1 Introduction
Large foundation models that are trained on a broad scale of data have gained massive success in
various applications [ 6], such as vision-language chatbot [ 1], text-image generation [ 42,44,46],
image-grounded text generation [ 2,31], and anything segmentation [ 26]. The segment anything model
(SAM) [ 26], trained on vast amounts of data from the SA-1B dataset, is capable of handling diverse
and complex visual tasks. The open accessibility of SAM makes it a promising foundation model,
serving as the starting point for fine-tuning analytics models in certain domains and downstream
applications, e.g., medical segmentation [ 61,54,39], 3D object segmentation [ 9], camouflaged object
segmentation [ 11], overhead image segmentation [ 45], and high-quality segmentation [ 25]. However,
many studies [ 5,18,57,38,27,55,58,66,65,59,48] have highlighted the secure issues of deep
learning models towards adversarial attacks. By corrupting the clean input with a finely crafted and

nearly imperceptible adversarial perturbation, the attacker can mislead the well-trained model at a
high success rate, with limited information available ( e.g., the surrogate model or limited queries).
Consequently, significant concerns arise regarding fine-tuning open-sourced models, as it inevitably
leaks critical information on downstream models, increasing their vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
Existing adversarial attacks can be roughly categorized into white-box attacks [ 3,18] and black-box
attacks [ 56,23], based on whether the attacker can fully access the victim model. The pre-requisite
of fully accessing the victim model complicates the practical deployment of white-box attacks.
Conversely, transfer-based black-box attacks that require less information pose a substantial threat
to real-world applications. The prevalent transfer-based black-box adversarial approaches [ 8,12,
17,22,32,34,36,15,60] typically suppose strong prior knowledge of the victim model’s task and
training data, such as a 1000-class classification task in ImageNet, thereby facilitating the training of a
similar surrogate model to generate potent adversarial examples (AEs). However, few studies [ 64,63]
consider a more practical and challenging scenario wherein the attacker is unaware of the victim
model’s tasks and the associated training data, due to stringent privacy and security protection policies
(e.g., datasets containing medical or human facial information). Moreover, the increasing size of
large foundation models significantly amplifies the costs of training effective task-specific surrogate
models. Thus, a more general and practical security concern is to explore the capability of attackers to
mount adversarial attacks on any victim model even without the need of accessing to its downstream
tasks-specific datasets to train a closely aligned surrogate model.
Given the practical security concerns of utilizing large foundation models, this paper investigates the
potential risks associated with fine-tuning the open-sourced SAM on a private and encrypted dataset.
We introduce a strong transfer-based adversarial attack called universal meta-initialized and gradient
robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT), which effectively mislead SAMs and their various fine-tuned
models without accessing the downstream task and training dataset, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The contributions of our paper are summarized as follows:
•We begin an investigation into a more practical while challenging adversarial attack problem:
attacking various SAMs’ downstream models by solely utilizing the information from the
open-sourced SAMs. We provide the theoretical insights and build the experimental setting
and benchmark, aiming to serve as a preliminary exploration for future research.
• We propose an offline universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic
vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is utilized as prior knowledge to
enhance the effectiveness of adversarial attacks through meta-initialization.
•We theoretically formulate that, when using the open-sourced SAM as the surrogate model,
a deviation occurs inevitably from the optimal direction of updating the adversary. Corre-
spondingly, we propose a gradient robust loss to mitigate this deviation.
•Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UMI-GRAT toward
SAMs and its downstream models. Moreover, UMI-GRAT can serve as a plug-and-play
strategy to significantly improve current state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attacks.
22 Related Work
The adversarial attacks aim to mislead the target (or victim) model by adding a small adversarial
perturbation in the clean input. Existing black-box attacks can be broadly categorized into query-based
and transfer-based adversarial attacks.
2.1 Query-based black box attacks
The query-based attacks consider the scenarios where the attacker does not have enough information to
train a satisfying surrogate model, thus generating adversarial examples by interacting and analyzing
the outputs from the victim model. This kind of attack can be divided into score-based query attacks
(SQAs) [ 12,24,47] that update the AEs by observing the change of the model’s prediction ( e.g., the
logits or softmax probability) and decision-based query attacks (DQAs) [ 7,10] that only rely on the
model’s top-1 prediction to update the AEs. However, this black-box search is naturally the NP-hard
problem, and solving the optimal update strategy is non-differentiable. This makes query-based attack
requires thousands of interactions with the victim model, making query-based attacks characterized
by low throughput, high latency, and marked conspicuousness to attack real-world deployed systems.
2.2 Transfer-based black box attacks
The transfer-based adversarial attacks generate the AEs to mislead the victim model based on a
similar surrogate model. Existing work mainly focuses on improving the transferability of AEs, which
can be categorized into four groups: input-augmentation-based attacks [ 8,56,52] that enhances
the effectiveness of generated AEs by augmenting the clean input ( e.g., using crop or rotation),
optimization-based attacks [ 13,35,51,62] that utilizes a better optimization strategy to guide the
update of AEs, model modification-based attacks [53, 4] or ensemble-based attacks [19, 43, 37, 33]
that enhances the AEs by utilizing a more powerful surrogate model, and feature-based attacks [ 32,34]
that attack the extracted feature in the intermediate layer. However, most of the work makes a strong
assumption that the surrogate and victim models are optimized for the same task with identical data
distribution, for example, both surrogate and victim models are optimized on the ImageNet dataset to
complete the classification task. In real-world deployed systems, due to privacy and security concerns,
attackers typically cannot access the training data ( e.g., datasets containing private information) or
obtain the optimization objectives of the victim model, making training a similar surrogate model
exceedingly difficult and unfeasible.
To address the challenge of deploying transfer-based black-box attacks without knowing the victim
model’s task and training dataset, this paper investigates the feasibility of attacking any victim model
optimized for unknown tasks and distributions that significantly differ from the open-sourced surrogate
model. We provide both theoretical and analytical evidence demonstrating that our proposed method
can enhance the transferability and effectiveness of the generated AEs. Moreover, the proposed
MUI-GRAT can serve as a plug-and-play adversarial generation strategy to enhance most existing
transfer-based adversarial attacks for this challenging task.
3 Preliminaries
3.1 Adversarial attacks
Letfbe any deep learning model and Lbe the loss function ( e.g.,, the cross-entropy loss) that
evaluates the quality of the model’s prediction. Let Bϵ(x) =n
x′:∥x′−x∥p≤ϵo
be an ℓp-norm
ball centered at the input x, where ϵis a pre-defined perturbation bound. For each input x, the
untargeted adversarial attacks aim to find an adversarial perturbation δby solving:
max
x+δ∈Bϵ(x)L(f(x), f(x+δ)).(1)
An effective solution to Equation 1 is iteratively updating the adversarial perturbation δbased on
the gradient of the loss function, for example, the iterative fast sign gradient method (I-FGSM) [ 28],
which iteratively updates δby:
δt+1=clipBϵ{δt+α·sign(∇δtL(f(x), f(x+δt)))}, (2)
3where ∇calculates the gradient and sign returns the sign ( i.e.,-1 or +1). αis a pre-defined step size
to update the adversarial perturbation. clipconstrains the magnitude of the perturbation by projecting
δinto the boundary of the ℓp-norm ball Bϵ.
3.2 Segment anything model
The SAM consists of three parts: an image encoder fϕim, a lightweight prompt encoder fϕpt, and a
lightweight mask decoder fϕmk. SAM gives the mask prediction based on the image input xand
prompt input p, which is expressed as:
y=SAM (x,p) =fϕmk 
fϕim(x), fϕpt(p)
, (3)
where fϕimis the image encoder that provides the fundamental understanding by converting natural
images into feature embeddings and fϕptextracts prompt embeddings. fϕmkis the mask decoder
that gives the mask prediction by fusing the information from both feature and prompt embeddings.
4 Methodology
4.1 Problem formulation
Letfϕsdenote the foundation model trained on a general dataset D, andfϕτdenote the victim model
fine-tuned on any downstream dataset Dτ, the parameters of those two models typically satisfy that:
ϕs= arg min
ϕsE
(x,y)∼D[L(fϕs(x),y)] ;ϕτ= arg min
ϕτE
(xτ,yτ)∼Dτ[Lτ(fϕτ(xτ),yτ)],ϕτinitia←−ϕs(4)
Definition 1 (Transferable adversarial attack via open-sourced SAM ).For any SAM’s downstream
model fϕτand the clean input xτ, without any further information on the downstream task and
dataset, the attacker aims to find the adversarial perturbation δssuch that:
max
δs∈BϵLτ(fϕτ(xτ), fϕτ(xτ+δs))s.t.{δs=AT(fϕs,xτ), Private (Dτ)}, (5)
where ATis the adversarial attack strategy and fϕsis the open-sourced SAM. A solution to that
is fine-tuning an optimal surrogate model fϕ∗sthat closely aligns with the victim model. However,
this approach becomes extremely challenging, when the downstream dataset is inaccessible to the
attacker. Alternatively, an effective solution is to design an optimal attack strategy AT∗such that:
AT∗= arg max
ATE
(xτ,yτ)∼Dτ[Lτ(fϕτ(xτ), fϕτ(xτ+AT∗(fϕs,xτ))]. (6)
Notably, fϕsandfϕτare optimized on two distinctive distributions DandDτwith losses
LandLτ, leading to a significant input-output mapping gap and gradient disparity, such as
Cosine _similarity (∇fϕs(xτ),∇fϕτ(xτ))≪1. This misalignment critically undermines the
effectiveness of current gradient-based adversarial attack strategies.
Further analysis on attacking SAMs. The standard operation to deploy SAM on downstream
tasks τinvolves fine-tuning the image encoder fϕimto inherit some well-generalized knowledge.
Concurrently, the lightweight prompt encoder fϕptand the mask decoder fϕmkare trained from
scratch to better accommodate the task. Considering the pivotal importance of feature embeddings
and the substantial variation caused by full retraining, an intuitive approach to generate effective
adversarial perturbation δsis utilizing the common information in fϕimto achieve:
max
δs∈BϵL 
fϕτ
im(xτ), fϕτ
im(xτ+δs)
s.t.δs=AT∗(fϕim,xτ), (7)
where ϕτ
imdenotes the updated parameters for the downstream model’s image encoder after fine-
tuning. Unless otherwise specified, we denote ϕimasϕin our subsequent content and take the
general SAM image encoder fϕas the surrogate model fϕs. We aim to generate the transfer-based
AEs to attack any fine-tuned image encoder fϕτon task τ, thereby misleading the entire prediction.
4.2 Extract the intrinsic vulnerability via universal meta initialization
Considering the great variation brought by fine-tuning the model on a new task τ, we aim to extract the
intrinsic vulnerability of the foundational model that remains invariant after fine-tuning. Subsequently,
this extracted vulnerability is leveraged as prior knowledge to initialize and enhance the adversarial
4attack AT∗. Inspired by the universal adversarial perturbation [ 40] that maintains effectiveness
across various inputs, we propose the universal meta initialization (UMI) algorithm, which optimizes
the initialization of adversarial perturbation to ensure both effectiveness and fast adaptability by
meta-learning [41, 16]. We define the universal and meta-initialized perturbation δas follows.
Definition 2 (Universal and meta-initialized perturbation δ).Given the foundation model fϕand
its fine-tuned models fϕτon downstream tasks τ, the universal and meta-initialized perturbation δ
that extracts the intrinsic vulnerability ensures both effectiveness and fast adaptability, which are:
1.Effectiveness (universal adversarial perturbation): δextracts the intrinsic vulnerability in the
foundation model, which can mislead the fϕsuccessfully on most natural inputs x, which is:
max
δ∈BϵE
x∼D[I{L(fϕ(x), fϕ(x+δ))> λ}], (8)
where λis a pre-defined threshold for one successful attack, and I{·}is the indicator function
that returns 1 if the inside condition is satisfied, else 0.
2.Fast adaptability (meta-initialization): for any downstream task τwith the corresponding private
downstream dataset Dτand model fϕτ, the attackers can maximize the loss Lon downstream
model fϕτby updating the initialization δvia the surrogate model fϕintsteps, which is:

if we attack the surrogate model
fϕand update the adversarial perturbation based on the first-order gradient.
Generally, Equation 8 aims to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the model, which remains
effective towards the input variation. Equation 9 guarantees that utilizing the perturbation δas the
initialization can rapidly threaten strong adversarial attacks for any downstream model. However, in
Equation 9, Dτandfϕτare unknown if the attacker is precluded from the downstream dataset. An
approximated solution to that involves using the dataset Dthat covers the distribution of most natural
inputs and a general model fϕthat can approximately represent the expectation of fϕτ, which is:

. (11)
To optimize the above two objectives simultaneously, our learning aims to move towards the direction
that maximizes the inner product of the gradients computed on both objectives. We utilize a first-order
meta-learning algorithm called Reptile [41], which defines the noise δupdate in each round as:
δ=δ+η·1
nnP
i=1
˜δµi−δ
, (12)
where ηis the update step size, and ˜δµi=Ut
µi(δ)is the updated perturbation on objective µiafter
optimizing titerations. Here we set n= 2, corresponding to the two objectives in Equation 8 and 11.
Forµ1that aims to optimize Equation 11, we set t= 5 andUt
µ1(δ)the same as Utdefined in
Equation 10. For µ2that aims to optimize Equation 8, we set Ut
µ2(δ)as:
Ut
µ2(δ)←arg min
δ+∆δ∥∆δ∥∞,s.t.L(fϕ(x), fϕ(x+δ+ ∆δ))> λ, ∆δ=tP
j=1∆δj. (13)
Equation 13 aims to find a minimal update ∆δnearby δto mislead the model fϕ. This can be
achieved by using enough iterations tand a small but gradually increased norm-ball boundary ϵ.
While finding an effective UMI requires a substantial number of inputs and iterations, this process
can be conducted fully offline, thus not hindering real-time adversarial attacks.
4.3 Enhance the transferability via gradient robust loss
Besides the utilization of intrinsic weakness inherent in the foundation model to enhance the ad-
versarial attack AT∗, another method involves generating the adversarial perturbation that sustains
robustness against the deviation arising from updates through a surrogate model that exhibits signifi-
cant gradient disparity compared to the fine-tuned downstream model.

great deviation in updating the adversarial perturbation δstowards the optimal solution in attacking

Mitigate the deviation caused by gradient disparity. To enhance effectiveness of the generated

Discussion with the intermediate-level attacks . The
intermediate-level attacks (ILAs) [ 34,22,32] also aim to max-
imize the dissimilarity of feature embeddings between the
clean and adversarial inputs. However, the main concern in
ILAs is how to find a directional vector vto guide the update
direction of fϕ(x)−fϕ(xadv), thus assuring that this feature-
wised dissimilarity can maximally mislead the final prediction.
Different from that, our LGRconsiders the problem one step
further: given an optimal directional vector v, how to generate
the adversarial perturbation that is roust towards the potential gradient variation in the victim model,
thus maximally misleading the victim model along the direction of v. Our core idea is hence in
parallel with ILAs and can be well combined with them to enhance the attack’s effectiveness. We
experimentally analyze and visualize the cosine similarity of the generated perturbations on CT-
scan images by white-box attacking open-sourced SAM and medical SAM using MI-FGSM [ 13],
ILPD [ 34], and our gradient robust attack in Figure 3, illustrating that the proposed LGReffectively
reduce the deviation caused by gradient variation and achieves a much transferability.
5 Implementation of the proposed MUI-GRAT
The detailed implementation of our proposed MUI-GRAT is illustrated in Algorithm 1 and Figure 2.
Our UMI-GRAT method consists of two stages. The initial stage involves the offline learning of
a universal meta-initialization (UMI), which aims to find the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the
foundation model. In the subsequent stage, we utilize the learned UMI as the prior knowledge to
enhance the gradient-variation robust adversarial attack.
We utilize the image encoder from Vit-H-based SAM as the general foundation model fϕfor
generating the UMI. The natural image dataset Dconsists of a total of 20,000 images, with 10,000
from ImageNet and 10,000 from the SA-1B dataset. We set the meta iterations Tmas 7 and the
universal step size ηas 1. The function Uni_Meta_Ini returns the learned UMI δthat can be used to
enhance the generation of subsequent input-specific adversarial perturbation.
InGR_Attack , we first adapt the calculated UMI δwith the task-specific image xτby one-step
update using FGSM [ 18] with the step size αadp= 4. Assume that ˜yrepresents the mean of the
feature embedding of natural images calculated by fϕ, ourLadpis defined as:
Ladp=∥mean (fϕ(xτ))−˜y∥p. (19)
Equation 19 aims to minimize the domain difference between vxτand the natural images by a specific
generated perturbation. The UMI δis then added by δadpand utilized to initialize δ∗
s. We set Tato
10, and update the adversarial perturbation δ∗
sby maximizing the gradient robust loss LGR.

6 Experimental Results
6.1 Experiment setup
Evaluation details: we conduct experiments on SAMs’ downstream models including, medical image
segmentation SAM [ 61], shadow segmentation SAM [ 11], and camouflaged object segmentation
SAM [ 11]. The datasets include: the synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset [ 29] that contains
3779 abdominal CT scans with 13 types of organs annotated, the ISTD dataset [ 49] that contains
1870 image triplets of shadow images, the COD10K dataset [ 14] that contains 5066 camouflaged
object images, the CHAMELEON dataset that contains 76 camouflaged images, and the CAMO
dataset [ 30], that contains 1500 camouflaged object images. We report the mean dice similarity score
(mDSC) and mean Hausdorff distance (mHD) for evaluating medical segmentation, mean absolute
error (MAE) and structural similarity ( Sα) for camouflaged object segmentation, and the bit error
rate (BER) for shadow segmentation. In medical SAM, the image encoder is based on SAM-Vit-B
and fine-tuned with LoRA [ 21]. In shadow segmentation and camouflaged object segmentation SAM,
the image encoders are based on SAM-Vit-H and fine-tuned with the adapter [ 20]. The decoders in
those models are all fully retrained.
Compared methods: We mainly compare and evaluate our method with current transfer-based
adversarial attacks including gradient-based attacks called MI-FGSM [ 13] and PGN [ 17], input-
augmentation based attacks called DMI-FGSM [ 56] and BSR [ 50], and intermediate-level feature
based attack called ILPD [34].
Implementation details: we use the MI-FGSM [ 13] as our basic attack method. For all methods
reported, we set the attack update iterations Taas 10, with the l∞bound ϵ= 10 and the step size
α= 2. For our UMI, we set the meta iterations Tm= 7, universal step size η= 1. For PGN and
BSR, we set the number of examples as 8 for efficiency.
6.2 Main results
We report our main results in Table 1. The first row of the data presents the model performance with
clean inputs. The second part of the data shows the model performance under different adversarial
attacks, where the data with the strongest attack is bold. The results demonstrate that the adversarial
examples generated by our proposed MUI-GRAT are more effective and generalizable than others,
consistently posing significant adversarial threats across various downstream models. In medical seg-
mentation and shadow segmentation tasks that share a great difference with the natural segmentation
tasks, our proposed MUI-GRAT greatly surpasses others ( e.g., MUI-GRAT reduces the mDSC from
81.88 to 5.22 while the previous best is 25.73.). This demonstrates the exceptional effectiveness of our
proposed MUI-GRAT when the attacker lacks information about the victim model, thereby generating
AEs using a surrogate model distinct from the victim model. In the camouflaged object segmentation
task where the data closely resembles natural images, all methods exhibit strong transferability. Our
MUI-GRAT achieves the best performance on the COD10K and CHAME datasets and performs
comparably to the SOTA method on the CAMO dataset.

Figure 4: The l2distance of feature embedding from clean inputs and adversarial examples. The
small distance gap between the surrogate and victim models indicates better transferability.
In the last part of Table 1, we analyze the performance of our proposed MUI-GRAT when combined
with other SOTA transfer-based attacks. Notably, all methods achieve an overall performance gain
after combining with ours. Though a slight performance drop occurs when attacking the CAMO
dataset, combining the MUI-GRAT brings great performance gain on attacking other tasks. This
demonstrates the versatility of our MUI-GRAT, which can be seamlessly applied in a plug-and-play
manner to bolster existing transfer-based attacks. We report the experiment results for attacking
open-sourced SAMs in Appendix A.2 and analyze the real-time attack efficiency for each method in
Appendix A.3.
6.3 Analysis of the transferability
The transferability property across diverse models ensures the effectiveness of the adversarial ex-
ample to mislead an unknown victim model. As discussed in Section 4.1, an intuitive objective
for attacking SAM’s downstream models is to maximize the dissimilarity of feature embedding
extracted from the clean input xand adversarial input xadv. Based on this, to numerically evaluate
the improvement of transferability brought by MUI-GRAT, we present the l2distance of clean and
adversarial feature embeddings attacked by MI-FGSM and ours and then analyze the distance gap
between the surrogate and victim models. We propose that a viable transferable attack methodology
should induce a substantial feature distance ∆fin the victim model, while simultaneously ensuring
minimal performance degradation ϵduring the transition from the surrogate to the victim model.
We show this comparison result in Figure 4, where we randomly pick a subset of inputs and show
the distance of feature embedding for each clean-adversarial input pair. The average distance gap
between the surrogate and victim models indicates the overall transferability of the attack method. In
the medical and shadow segmentation SAM, where the data and task are distinct from the original
SAM, we find a great performance drop for MI-FGSM when transferred from the surrogate model to
the victim model. Though the adversarial examples generated by MI-FGSM induce a large feature
distance in the surrogate model, their effect on the victim model is relatively minor. Conversely, the
adversaries generated by MUI-GRAT maintain much better transferability, suffering from a small
performance drop when transferred from the surrogate model to the victim model. In the camouflage
object segmentation task, where the data are natural images and the segmentation objective is similar
to the original SAM, both attack algorithms show good transferability (nearly no performance drop
when transferred from the surrogate model to the victim models). Our MUI-GRAT shows better
transferability with nearly no performance drop.
6.4 Ablation study
In this section, we explore the contribution of the proposed MUI and GRAT by integrating them
with MI-FGSM and PGN attacks. The ablation results are shown in Table 2. In scenarios where
the task and dataset distributions of surrogate and victim models differ markedly (e.g., medical
image segmentation and natural image segmentation), we observe that the GR loss significantly
enhances effectiveness. Meanwhile, across all scenarios, the proposed MUI consistently contributes
to enhancing the adversarial attacks. Particularly in camouflaged object segmentation when the
surrogate and victim models exhibit close similarities, the MUI yields substantial benefits.

✗ ✓ 15.51 93.98 10.36 36.25 24.10
This observation aligns with our analysis in Section 4. By assuming a hypothetical update h∆ϕτin the
victim model, the proposed gradient robust loss greatly enhances the effectiveness of the generated
AEs towards the gradient variation, thus benefiting more for medical and shadow segmentation tasks.
Moreover, the MUI aims to find the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the basic foundation model
through a broad general dataset, which is then provided as the prior knowledge for generating a more
effective adversary. Therefore, in scenarios where the victim model inherits substantial information
from the surrogate model, this prior knowledge becomes increasingly reliable and effective.
7 Conclusion
The security of utilizing large foundation models is a critical issue for deploying them in real-world
applications. This paper, for the first time, considers a more challenging and practical attack scenario
where the attacker executes a potent adversarial attack on SAM-based downstream models without
prior knowledge of the task and data distribution. To achieve that, we propose a universal meta-
initialization (UMI) algorithm to uncover the intrinsic vulnerabilities inherent in the foundation
model. Moreover, by theoretically formulating the adversarial update deviation during the attacking
process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we propose a gradient
robust loss that simulates the corresponding uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation
and analytically demonstrates that the proposed method effectively enhances the transferability.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed UMI-GRAT toward SAM and its
downstream tasks, highlighting the vulnerabilities and potential security risks of the direct utilization
and fine-tuning of open-sourced large foundation models.

We evaluated 10 attack methods presented in our paper over 5 random seed runs on the subset of
SAM’s downstream tasks and reported the mean performance with its standard deviation. We use the
same experimental setting provided in Section 6.1. The results indicate that the randomness is small
and similar among all attacking methods. The uncertainty level of UMI-GRAT in mean Hausdorff
Distance (mHD) is marginally higher compared to the other methods. This can account for the higher
mHD value achieved by the UMI-GRAT.

We report the mean average precision (mAP) and mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) metrics to
evaluate the performance of attacking open-sourced SAMs. We compare the performance of MI-
FGSM and ours MUI-GRAT. The implementation of these attacks adheres to the details described in
Section 6.1. We randomly select 500 images from the SA-1B dataset and evaluate the performance of
SAMs under the ’AutomaticMaskGenerator’ mode. We white-box attacks SAM-Vit-B, SAM-Vit-L,
and SAM-Vit-H models. Meanwhile, we also discuss the black-box transferability of generated AEs
across different models. The results are shown in Table A.4.
Our findings reveal that both MI-FGSM and MUI-GRAT achieve comparably strong attack perfor-
mance in the white-box scenario. In the black-box scenario, where AEs generated on one surrogate
model are transferred to a different victim model, our results indicate that the surrogate model is
critical for the transferability of generated AEs. The AEs with the strongest transferability are
generated by our MUI-GRAT on attacking SAM-Vit-B, which exhibits a great performance gain
compared with others. However, when employing SAM-ViT-L as the surrogate model, there is a
slight reduction in the transferability of AEs produced by our MUI-GRAT. Conversely, when the
surrogate model is SAM-Vit-H, the transferability of AEs generated by our MUI-GRAT surpasses
MI-FGSM by a large margin.

BSR 8 2.91
ILPD 1 0.66
MUI-GRAT 1 0.36We analyze the real-time attack efficiency of the meth-
ods mentioned above. We report the average time re-
quired for generating one AE when the input resolution
is512×512on the SAM-Vit-B model using one RTX
4090 GPU. The results are shown in Table A.5.
We find that our proposed MUI-GRAT achieves second-
high efficiency when compared with others. The
ILPD requires extra attack iterations (e.g., 10-step MI-
FGSM) to find a directional guide vector v. The input
augmentation-based attack methods, such as BSR and DMI-FGSM, require multiple samples in each
iteration to do the augmentation and the PGN also requires multiple samples to obtain a stable gradi-
ent direction. However, our method utilizes an offline generated MUI and only conducts one-time
gradient augmentation in each iteration, thus achieving a much higher efficiency than others.
A.4 Hardware Setup
We run our experiments for attacking the medical segmentation model using one RTX 4090 GPU
with 24 GB memory. We run the rest of the experiments using one RTX A6000 GPU with 48 GB
memory.
16A.5 Visualization of the adversarial examples and the prediction
We visualize adversarial examples generated by MUI-GRAT utilizing solely the open-sourced SAM
and the corresponding adversarial predictions in Figure A.5 and Figure A.6. The images are randomly
selected. This visualization provides a more straightforward demonstration of the impact of the
adversarial attack threatened by MUI-GRAT, showing how it significantly compromises the reliability
of the large foundation model’s predictions with just a single independent input image.

17A.6 Impact Statement
The increasing reliance on large foundation models in various real-world applications amplifies the
critical importance of ensuring their secure utilization. This paper mainly discusses the potential
risks of adversarial threats associated with the direct utilization and fine-tuning of the open-sourced
model even on private and encrypted datasets. To accomplish that, we begin an investigation into a
more practical while challenging adversarial attack problem: attacking various SAM’s downstream
models by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. We then provide the theo-
retical insights and build the experimental setting and benchmark, aiming to serve as a preliminary
exploration for future research in this area. Experimentally, we validate the vulnerability of SAM
and its downstream models under the proposed MUI-GRAT, indicating the security risk inherent in
the direct utilization and fine-tuning of open-sourced large foundation models, thus highlighting the
urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to protect these models from adversarial threats.
A.7 Limitations
The limitations of our paper are:
•The proposed UMI-GRAT is not contingent upon a prior regarding the model’s architecture,
suggesting its potential applicability across various model paradigms. However, the experi-
ments only tested MUI-GRAT on the prevalent SAMs and their downstream models. The
capability of UMI-GRAT to pose a threat to other large foundation models remains a topic
for further exploration.
•While this paper highlights the risk of direct utilization of SAM and fine-tuning it on the
downstream task, this paper does not provide and validate an effective solution for this
secure concern.
18NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We demonstrate the contributions and the scope of our paper in the abstract
and introduction.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of our work in Appendix A.7
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
19Justification: For each theoretical result in Section 4, we give the detailed proof and
illustration.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present the details of the implementation of our method in Section 6.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
20Answer: [No]
Justification: We intend to release the code associated with this work subsequent to the
paper’s acceptance. This will allow us to confirm that the code is stable and thoroughly
tested prior to its public dissemination. Our goal in releasing the code is to enable replication
of our findings, foster collaboration with fellow researchers, and uphold the principles of
open science.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We give the implementation details and explain every result we got in the
experiment to help readers understand.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.
But we keep the random seed fixed for all competing methods.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
21•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We list the equipment needed for running and reproduce our experiment in
Appendix A.4.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer:[Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed and met the code of ethics for our research.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the social impact of our research in Section A.6.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
22•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This research does not have this kind of risk.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
23•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not introduce new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not describe potential risks incurred by study participants.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
