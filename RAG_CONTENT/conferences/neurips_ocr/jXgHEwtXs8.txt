Abstract
Existing high-resolution image harmonization methods typically rely on global
color adjustments or the upsampling of parameter maps. However, these methods
ignore local variations, leading to inharmonious appearances. To address this
problem, we propose an Adaptive-Interval Color Transformation method (AICT),
which predicts pixel-wise color transformations and adaptively adjusts the sam-
pling interval to model local non-linearities of the color transformation at high
resolution. Specifically, a parameter network is first designed to generate multiple
position-dependent 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs), which use the color
and position of each pixel to perform pixel-wise color transformations. Then, to
enhance local variations adaptively, we separate a color transform into a cascade of
sub-transformations using two 3D LUTs to achieve the non-uniform sampling inter-
vals of the color transform. Finally, a global consistent weight learning method is
proposed to predict an image-level weight for each color transform, utilizing global
information to enhance the overall harmony. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our AICT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight architecture.

Figure 1: Our method predicts pixel-wise color
transformations at low resolution and adaptively
the adjusts sampling interval to model local non-
linearities of the color transform at high resolution.Image composition [ 3,2,24,51] aims to com-
bine a foreground object with a background im-
age to create a realistic composite, which holds
significant potential across various domains, in-
cluding art, entertainment, commerce [ 3,43,52],
and data augmentation [ 11,30,26]. However,
since the foreground and background may be
captured under different conditions, directly
pasting the foreground onto the background usu-
ally results in an inconsistent appearance. To
address this problem, image harmonization en-
deavors to adjust the color of the foreground to
seamlessly integrate with the background, which
plays a pivotal role in image editing.
Traditional image harmonization methods [ 5,19,27,28,29,36,37] primarily concentrate on aligning
the color statistics of the foreground to match the background using hand-crafted features. Since

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).these methods lack consideration for the content of the composite images, they often yield suboptimal
results when there are substantial differences in appearance between the foreground and background.
With the rapid advance of deep learning, learning-based methods [ 38,17,9,8,22,15,33,6,44,13]
have become dominant and achieved remarkable progress. These methods usually adopt encoder-
decoder based structures to learn the dense pixel-to-pixel transformation between composite images
and ground-truth images at a low resolution (e.g., 256×256pixels), while real-world applications
increasingly demand high-resolution images. Although these methods can process images with any
size theoretically, the computational cost required for high-resolution images is extremely expensive.
Recently, several methods [ 20,21,46,12] have emerged to tackle the challenge of high-resolution
image harmonization. To reduce computational costs, these methods usually use a low-resolution com-
posite image to predict transformation parameters for processing the corresponding high-resolution
composite image instead of directly generating the final image. These methods can be mainly catego-
rized into two groups. Harmonizer [ 20] and S2CRNet [ 21] focus on predicting image-level parameters
to perform global color adjustments. However, these adjustments do not contain any semantic and
local information, which leads to identical changes for pixels in different regions with the same color
value. On the other hand, DCCF [ 46] and PCT-Net [ 12] predict low-resolution parameter maps and
then directly upsample them to align with high-resolution composite images for pixel-wise color
transformation. However, upsampling low-resolution parameter maps may introduce errors, which
fails to model local non-linearities of the color transform at high resolution. In summary, these
four methods ignore local color transformations across the foreground regions, which are prone to
generate inharmony results in local regions.

the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8]. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance while main-
taining a lightweight architecture.To address this problem, we propose an
Adaptive-Interval Color Transformation method
(AICT) for high-resolution image harmoniza-
tion. As shown in Figure 1, AICT predicts pa-
rameter maps for pixel-wise color transforma-
tions, rather than performing global color adjust-
ments. Additionally, it adaptively adjusts the
sampling interval to model local non-linearities
of the color transformation at high resolution.
To implement this complex transformation, we
formulate the task as an image-based multi-
ple curve estimation problem. Specifically, a
parameter network is first proposed to gener-
ate multiple curves as position-dependent 3-
dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs), which
use the color and position of each pixel to per-
form pixel-wise color transformations. Then, to
enhance local variations adaptively, we propose
an adaptive interval learning method, which sep-
arates a color transform into a cascade of sub-
transformations using two position-dependent
3D LUTs to achieve the non-uniform sampling
intervals of the color transform. Finally, a global consistent weight learning method is proposed to
predict an image-level weight for each color transform, utilizing global information to enhance the
overall harmony by modeling the influence of background brightness on the foreground. As shown in
Figure 2, AICT achieves state-of-the-art performance in foreground-normalized MSE (fMSE) on the
full-resolution images of the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8] while maintaining a model size comparable to
PCT-Net [12]. Our main contributions are as follows:
•We propose an Adaptive-Interval Color Transformation method to perform pixel-wise
color transformations and model local non-linearities of the color transformation for high-
resolution image harmonization.
•We propose an adaptive interval learning method to achieve a flexible sampling point
allocation and a global consistent weight method to utilize global information to enhance
the overall harmony.
2•Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in high-resolution image harmonization while maintaining a lightweight and
simple network architecture.
2 Related Work
2.1 Image Harmonization
To reduce computational costs, existing high-resolution image harmonization methods [ 20,21,46,
12,7,40] usually takes a low-resolution image as input to predict transformation parameters for
processing the corresponding high-resolution image instead of directly outputting the final image.
For example, Harmonizer [ 20] employs a neural network to regress filter arguments based on low-
resolution images, which are then used for several white-box filters to adjust various aspects of
the foreground, including brightness, contrast, and other characteristics. S2CRNet [ 21] focuses on
extracting spatial-separated embeddings from low-resolution images to predict parameters of the
piece-wise curve mapping for performing color-wise transformations. Similarly, Wang et al. [ 40]
utilize down-sampled images to predict global RGB curves for performing color correction at higher
resolutions. Furthermore, they propose to predict and upsample low-resolution shading maps to
address local tonal variations. These three methods predict image-level parameters to perform
global color adjustments. Unlike these methods, DCCF [ 46] processes low-resolution images to
acquire human comprehensible neural filter maps, which are subsequently upsampled and applied
to the original input image. PCT-Net [ 12] predicts affine transformation parameter maps based on
low-resolution images and upsamples them to match high-resolution images. Both methods predict
low-resolution parameter maps and then upsample them directly to align with high-resolution images
for pixel-wise transformations. In addition, CDTNet [ 7] performs pixel-to-pixel transformation at
low resolution and color-to-color transformation at high resolution in parallel. It subsequently utilizes
a refinement module to integrate the two intermediate outputs. The above methods typically rely on
global color adjustments or the upsampling of parameter maps, which ignore local variations. Our
method performs pixel-wise color transformations and models local non-linearities for high-resolution
image harmonization.
2.2 LUT-based Image Enhancement
A lookup table (LUT) defines a set of tables consisting of output values, where each value can be
addressed by a set of indices. When provided with an input combination, it can output a corresponding
value by performing lookup and interpolation operations, so it usually serves as an effective and
efficient representation of a univariate or multivariate function. Zeng et al. [ 49] propose to learn
multiple basis 3D LUTs and predict content-dependent weights to fuse them into an image-adaptive
LUT for photo enhancement. To consider global scenarios and local spatial information, Wang et
al. [41] introduce a lightweight two-head weight predictor for image-level scenario adaptation and
pixel-wise category fusion. Yang et al. [ 47] achieve a more flexible sampling point allocation in 3D
LUTs by adaptively learning the non-uniform sampling intervals in the 3D color space. To enhance
the expressiveness of the LUT, Yang et al. [ 48] decompose a single color transform into a cascade of
sub-transforms and use 1D LUTs to increase cell utilization within the 3D LUT. Zhang et al. [ 50]
employ hash techniques to reduce the space complexity of 3D LUTs. Liu et al. [ 23] propose to learn
a context map for the pixel-level category and a group of image-adaptive coefficients for achieving
context-aware 4D LUT. These methods typically predict several weight parameters to fuse pre-trained
LUTs for global RGB-to-RGB transformations, while our method predicts position-dependent 3D
LUTs for pixel-wise color transformations.
3 Method
Given a composite image ˜I∈RH×W×3and a binary mask M∈ {0,1}H×Wthat indicates the
foreground region to be harmonized, image harmonization aims to adjust the color of the foreground
region to obtain a harmonized image ˆI∈RH×W×3close to the ground truth image I∈RH×W×3.
To achieve high-resolution image harmonization at a low computational cost, we formulate the
task as an image-based multiple curve estimation problem and propose an Adaptive-Interval Color
Transformation method (AICT) as shown in Figure 3. AICT consists of a high resolution (HR)

are downsampled to predict two parameter maps CandF. In the HR branch, Cis used to redistribute
the color values of ˜Iinto specific ranges of the following F, which achieves adaptively adjusting the

branch and a low resolution (LR) branch. In the LR branch, ˜IandMare first downsampled to obtain
a low-resolution composite image ˜Ilow∈RH′×W′×3and foreground mask Mlow∈ {0,1}H′×W′,
where H′< H andW′< W . They are then fed into a parameter network to predict two parameter
maps C∈RH′×W′×QandF∈RH′×W′×Qand they are regarded as curves in the form of position-
dependent 3D LUTs, where Qis equal to three times the number of knot points in a curve. In the
HR branch, Cis used to process color values and pixel coordinates to redistribute the color values
of˜Iinto specific ranges of the following Ffor achieving pixel-wise adaptive adjustment of the
sampling interval. Fis used to map the redistributed color values and pixel coordinates to final color
values, achieving pixel-wise color transformation. Therefore, the color transformation in our method
includes two cascaded pixel-wise sub-transformations.
3.1 Adaptive Interval Learning
In the LR branch, ˜IlowandMloware fed into the parameter network to produce CandF. As shown in
Figure 3, we use the Transformer encoder [ 13] to construct the parameter network, which consists of
multiple attention layers. Firstly, the low-resolution composite image ˜Ilowand foreground mask Mlow
are divided into patches, which are then projected into the embedding space. Positional encodings
are added to the embedded patches, which are processed by the Transformer encoder. The output of
the Transformer encoder is reassembled to obtain the feature T1∈R64×64×256, and a deconvolution
layer is applied to reduce the feature channel number and perform upsampling to obtain the feature
T2∈RH′×W′×12. Subsequently, T2is processed through a 1×1convolution to obtain the parameter
mapC∈RH′×W′×Q. We individually process each color channel and divide Cinto three parameter
maps CR∈RH′×W′×K,CG∈RH′×W′×K, and CB∈RH′×W′×K, where Qis equal to 3×K.
Taking the red channel of an RGB image as an example, the corresponding parameter map is CR.
To achieve adaptive interval learning, we need to reconstruct the parameter map CR. The softmax
function is used to obtain the normalized interval VR∈[0,1]H′×W′×M=Softmax (CR,axis= 3) ,
where axis= 3 indicates that normalization is performed along the third dimension [ 47] ofCR.
We perform cumulative summation in the third dimension of VRand then add an origin for each
position to obtain the sampling coordinates KR∈[0,1]H′×W′×(M+1), which can be expressed as
KR= [Z;Cumsum (VR,axis= 3)] , where Zis aH′×W′×1matrix filled with zero values, and
the[·;·]denotes the concatenation operation. In such a way, each value in KRis within the range of 0
to 1 and maintains the monotone increasing properties along the third dimension ( KR
c,b,i< KR
c,b,j,
forc, b∈I255
0,i, j∈IM
0, and i < j ).
4We use position-dependent 3D LUTs to achieve pixel-wise adaptive adjustment of the sampling
interval. The position-dependent 3D LUT maps spatial coordinates and color values to new color
values [ 35]. We treat KRas a position-dependent 3D LUT, which utilizes lookup and interpolation
operations to serve as a color mapping curve. For a given coordinate (i, j)and its color value x(i, j)
in the red channel of ˜I, we can find the corresponding position (u, v, w )inKR, where u=iH′−1
H−1,
v=jW′−1
W−1,w=x(i, j)K−1
CmaxandCmaxrepresents the maximum color value in the image. Based
on(u, v, w ), we can obtain adjacent 8 sampling points in KRand perform trilinear interpolation to
produce a new color value ˆx(i, j). The entire process can be formulated as
ˆx(i, j) =t(l(i, j, x (i, j), KR)) (1)
where tandldenote trilinear interpolation and lookup operations, respectively. The upper section of
Figure 4 demonstrates the color redistribution process. Here, each coordinate and its corresponding
color value are mapped to a new color value using KR. Similarly, we can obtain redistributed color
values for the other color channels in the same way.

Figure 4: The illustration of the color redistribution and result

are obtained by using FRaccording to the coordinates and
redistributed color values.After obtaining the redistributed color
values, we utilize the parameter map
Fto achieve pixel-wise color trans-
formation. As shown in Figure 3, we
apply a 1×1convolution to the fea-
tureT2for obtaining the intermedi-
ate parameter map R∈RH′×W′×Q,
which are divided into three param-
eter maps RR∈RH′×W′×K,RG∈
RH′×W′×K, and RB∈RH′×W′×K
according to the color channel. When
inserting the foreground into a new
background, the average brightness
of the foreground will be influenced
by the background. For example, the
inserted foreground may experience
overall darkening, brightening, or a
bias toward a certain color. As shown
in Figure 5, the foreground region un-
dergoes darkening after image harmonization. Therefore, we propose a globally consistent weight
learning method and design a weight learning module to learn image-level parameters for controlling
overall color transformations. These parameters can also be regarded as scene classification, which
are adjusted based on different scenes. The weight learning module consists of two 3 ×3 convolutional
layers, Batch Normalization (BN) layers [ 18], max-pooling layers, ReLU activation functions, and
one fully-connected layer, making it lightweight. It processes T1to predict weight vectors wR∈RK,
wG∈RK, andwB∈RK, which are used to multiply with RR,RG, and RBto obtain the final
parameter maps FR∈RH′×W′×K,FG∈RH′×W′×K, and FB∈RH′×W′×K, respectively.
Composite image Ground truth
Figure 5: The illustration of the overall impact of the back-
ground on the foreground. The foreground is outlined in
red. The pixel histogram statistics indicate that the overall
foreground region undergoes darkening after the process of
image harmonization.We also treat FRas a position-
dependent 3D LUT. For a given coor-
dinate (i, j)and its redistributed color
value ˆx(i, j)in the red channel of ˜I,
lookup and interpolation operators are
performed in FRto produce the final
output color value ˆy(i, j). The bottom
part of Figure 4 illustrates the result
prediction process. Due to the differ-
ence in resolution, each pixel in the pa-
rameter maps KRandFRcorresponds
to a local region of the composite im-
age. However, the color values in a
5region are usually distributed within certain ranges. Therefore, KRaims to redistribute these color
values across the entire color value range, thereby improving the utilization of sampling points in
FRand enhancing the expressiveness of the curve. By combining these two curves ( KRandFR),
our method achieves the capability of adaptively adjusting the sampling intervals. Finally, the result
images corresponding to each channel are obtained by transforming the color values at each position
of˜I, which are then concatenated to produce the harmonized image ˆI. As we process each color
channel separately for an RGB image, the parameter network needs to predict six curves.
3.3 Loss Functions
During the training phase, the loss Lhighis calculated in the HR branch based on the difference
between ˆIandI. To improve the performance of AICT for images with small foregrounds, we adopt
the foreground-normalized MSE loss [33], which is formulated as
Lhigh=HP
i=1WP
j=1ˆIi,j−Ii,j2
2
max{Amin,HP
i=1WP
j=1Mi,j}(2)
where Aminis a hyper-parameter to stabilize training. By replacing ˜Iwith ˜Ilowin the framework,
we can also obtain the low-resolution harmonized image ˆIlowand the loss Llow. We also apply the
foreground-normalized MSE loss to minimize the difference between ˆIlowand the low-resolution
version of the ground truth Ilow. Overall, our network can be trained by optimizing the combination
of the losses above
L=Lhigh+λLlow (3)
where λis a hyper-parameter that controls the weight of Llow. Our parameter network is trained in an
end-to-end manner.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setting
4.1.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metrics
Following the same settings as previous methods [ 20,46,12], we train and evaluate our method on
the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8], which consists of four subsets (HAdobe5k, HCOCO, HDay2night, and
HFlickr) and includes 73146 samples for image harmonization. Each sample contains a composite
image, a corresponding foreground mask, and a ground truth image. The HAdobe5k, HCOCO,
HDay2night, and HFlickr subsets consist of 2160, 4283, 133, and 828 test images, respectively. These
subsets have resolutions ranging from 312×230to6048×4032 pixels. The width and height of
images in the HCOCO, HDay2night, and HFlickr subsets are all below 1024 pixels, and only the
HAdobe5k subset is composed of images with a width or height larger than 1024 pixels.
We also train and evaluate our method on the ccHarmony dataset [ 25], which is constructed by
transferring each image across different illumination conditions to simulate natural illumination
variations. This dataset contains 3080 training samples and 1180 test samples, and each sample
includes a composite image, a corresponding foreground mask, and a ground truth image.
Additionally, we evaluate our method against other methods on a real composite dataset [ 7], which
consists of 100 test samples. Each sample contains only a composite image and a corresponding
foreground mask. Note that all datasets used in our experiments are publicly available.
For the quantitative performance metrics, we calculate several key indicators, including Mean Square
Error (MSE), foreground Mean Square Error (fMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for each individual image in the dataset. Subsequently, we
compute the average values for the entire dataset and for each specific subset. While MSE serves
as a crucial evaluation metric, it tends to be biased towards images that contain larger foreground
regions due to the variations in foreground sizes across the dataset. This limitation makes MSE less
reliable for a comprehensive assessment of image quality. In contrast, fMSE offers a more balanced
and equitable evaluation of overall quality, making it a more suitable choice for our analysis [12].

image harmonization using full-resolution images. Following [ 7], we also conduct tests on the
HAdobe5k subset at two different resolutions ( 1024×1024 and2048×2048 ). For the ccHarmony
dataset [ 25], we use the parameters trained on the iHarmony4 dataset as the initial parameters, and
then fine-tune our network on the training set of the ccHarmony dataset. Following [ 25], the test
image size in this dataset is set as 256×256. To augment training samples, we crop the composite
image according to a random bounding box, the width and height of which are not smaller than
the halved width and height of the composite image, respectively. The random horizontal flip is
also applied to training samples. Our network is implemented based on the PyTorch framework and

4.2 Comparison with the State-of-the-arts
We conduct experiments and comparisons on the full-resolution test images of the iHarmony4
dataset [ 8]. AdaInt [ 47] and SepLUT [ 48], originally designed for image enhancement, are modified
7and trained from scratch on the iHarmony4 dataset for the image harmonization task. Our AICT has
three key differences compared to these methods. Firstly, they predict several weight parameters to
fuse pre-trained LUTs, while our method dynamically predicts entire LUTs based on input. Secondly,
they focus on global RGB-to-RGB transformations, whereas our AICT enables pixel-wise color
transformations. Lastly, instead of applying adaptive interval learning and separable lookup tables for
global sampling adjustments, our AICT achieves pixel-wise sampling interval adjustment to model
local non-linearities in color transformation. To the best of our knowledge, only Harmonizer [ 20],
DCCF [ 46], and PCT-Net [ 12] perform image harmonization on full-resolution images. Since Xu et
al. [46] do not provide fMSE and SSIM values, we evaluate DCCF by running the provided code for
comparison. Guerreiro et al. [ 12] propose two types of architectures: a CNN-based encoder-decoder
network and a network based on a Visual Transformer (ViT) [ 10]. We choose the ViT-based network
for comparison as it demonstrates better performance. The quantitative comparison results are shown
in Table 1. We observe that AICT outperforms other methods on most metrics. Due to the limited
amount of training samples in the HDay2night subset, our method achieves lower performance on
this subset. To evaluate performance on low-resolution images, we also report quantitative results
on the iHarmony4 dataset at a 256×256resolution (see the Appendix). Additionally, we evaluate
the harmonization performance on the HAdobe5k subset at a 2048×2048 resolution. As shown in
Table 2, our method achieves the best performance across all metrics. Furthermore, we compare our
method with others on this subset at a 1024×1024 resolution (see the Appendix).
As shown in Figure 6, we present the qualitative results of AICT against state-of-the-art methods
on the full-resolution test images of the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8]. Compared to other methods, the
images generated by AICT are closer to the ground truth images, making the composite images more
realistic. More qualitative results are presented in the Appendix. Additionally, we also present the
quantitative comparison results on the real composite dataset [ 25] to demonstrate the superiority and
generalizability of our method (see the Appendix).
To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we also present quantitative comparison
results on the ccHarmony dataset [ 25] at256×256resolution. As shown in Table 3, our method also
achieves the best performance across all metrics.

Our AICT 232.66 24.14 38.46We study the influence of the adaptive in-
terval learning method on image harmo-
nization performance using the iHarmony4
dataset [ 8], as shown in Table 4. We first
remove the weight learning module and the
adaptive interval learning method in AICT,
denoted as “Single”. Compared to AICT,
this method achieves lower performance.
We then incorporate the channel-crossing
strategy [ 34,35] into “Single”, denoted as
“Cross”. The parameter model uses an RGB
image to predict parameter maps, which in-
herently include information from all color
channels. Thus, the channel-crossing strat-
egy introduces redundancy without improv-
ing performance. We also remove the adap-
tive interval learning method in AICT, denoted as “w/o Int”. Compared to AICT, the performance
of this method decreases due to the reduced expressiveness of the curves. To investigate whether
using more LUTs can improve performance, we first cascade 2 and 3 LUTs for adaptive interval
learning, denoted as “Int ×2” and “Int ×3”, respectively. Then, we cascade 2 and 3 LUTs for
color transformation, denoted as “Tra ×2” and “Tra ×3”, respectively. Finally, we cascade 4 and
6 LUTs for alternating adaptive interval learning and color transformation, denoted as “Alt ×2”
and “Alt ×3”, respectively. The experimental results show that increasing the number of LUTs
for adaptive interval learning does not improve performance. Furthermore, using more LUTs for
color transformation decreases performance due to increased training difficulty. Additionally, we
combine AdaInt [ 47] and SepLUT [ 48] for global RGB-to-RGB transformations, denoted as “AdaInt
8(b) Harmonizer (c) DCCF (d) PCT -Net (e) AICT (f) Ground truth (a) Composite image

+ SepLUT”. Compared to AICT, one reason for the performance decline of “AdaInt + SepLUT” is
the neglect of local context.

Our AICT 228.43 17.76 39.40We conduct ablation studies on the global
consistent weight learning method, as
shown in Table 5. First, we remove the
weight vector corresponding to the R chan-
nel, denoted as “w/o R”. Next, we remove
the weight vectors for both the R and G
channels, denoted as “w/o RG”. Finally, we
remove the entire weight learning module,
denoted as “w/o Weight”. As the number of
removed weight vectors increases, the har-
monization performance decreases, high-
lighting the importance of the global con-
sistent weight learning method. We also
predict spatially varying weight parameters
to weight each sampling point of the pa-
rameter map R, denoted as “Spatial”. The
results for “Spatial” indicate that learning
spatially varying weight parameters does not improve performance, as the LUT is responsible for
pixel-wise color transformations. These observations demonstrate that the proposed adaptive interval
learning method and global consistent weight learning method are effective.

Our AICT 228.43 17.76 39.40We conduct studies on key parameters
using the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8], includ-
ing the number of knots K, the coeffi-
cient of the LR branch loss λ, and the
hyper-parameter Aminin the foreground-
normalized MSE loss, as shown in Table 6.
We set Kto 6, 8, and 10 to analyze the
influence of curves with different numbers
of knots for the image harmonization task,
where Kis set to 8 in AICT. By comparing
“K=6” with AICT, we observe that increas-
ing the number of knots reduces fMSE and
MSE while improving PSNR, indicating that a larger number of knots enhances the harmonization
ability of the curves. However, as the number of knots increases, the performance of “K=10” de-
creases, suggesting that an excessive number of knots increases network parameters. This complicates
the training process of the network, making it more challenging to achieve optimal performance. To
investigate the effect of the LR branch loss, we set λto 0, 0.01, and 0.1, where λset to 0.01 in AICT.
When λis set to 0.01, AICT achieves the best performance on all metrics, demonstrating that an
optimal weight for the LR branch loss is crucial for the high-resolution image harmonization. For the
foreground-normalized MSE loss, we set AmintoH×WandH′×W′in the HR and LR branch,
respectively, which means these objective functions are equivalent to MSE functions, denoted as
“MSE”. The results indicate that using the foreground-normalized MSE loss improves harmonization
performance, as it prevents training samples with foregrounds of different sizes from being trained
with varying loss magnitudes, ensuring effective training for small foreground images.

Our AICT 228.43 17.76 39.40In this paper, we formulate image har-
monization as an image-based multiple
curve estimation problem and propose
an Adaptive-Interval Color Transforma-
tion method, which predicts pixel-wise
color transformation and adaptively adjusts
the sampling interval to model local non-
linearities of the color transformation at
high resolution. Specifically, a parameter
network is first designed to generate multi-
ple curves as position-dependent 3D LUTs,
which use the color and position of each
pixel to perform pixel-wise color transfor-
mation. Then, we separate a color trans-
form into a cascade of sub-transformations
using two position-dependent 3D LUTs to achieve the non-uniform sampling intervals of the color
transform. Finally, a global consistent weight learning method is proposed to predict an image-level
weight for each color transform, utilizing global information to enhance the overall harmony. Experi-
mental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution
image harmonization with a lightweight architecture.

In this section, we provide supplementary quantitative results to further demonstrate the advantages
of our proposed method. First, we evaluate AICT against more state-of-the-art methods using low-
resolution test images from the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8]. Following previous work, we downsample
these images to 256×256pixels to obtain low-resolution versions. It is important to note that AICT
employs parameters trained on high-resolution images from the iHarmony4 dataset [ 8] and uses
low-resolution images as input to perform pixel-wise color transformation instead of downsampling
high-resolution output images for comparison. As shown in Table 7, AICT achieves superior
performance across most metrics, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method on low-
resolution images. However, our method performs slightly worse on the HDay2night subset due to
the limited number of training images in this subset.

Our AICT 156.81 19.50 39.67 0.9864We also compare AICT with state-
of-the-art methods on the HAdobe5k
subset at a resolution of 1024×
1024 . As shown in Table 8, our
method achieves the best performance
in terms of MSE and PSNR, and per-
forms slightly worse than CDTNet-
256 [ 7] in terms of fMSE and SSIM.
It is important to note that CDT-
Net [ 7] requires retraining for im-
ages of varying resolutions. In con-
trast, AICT demonstrates flexibil-
ity by using parameters trained on
high-resolution images from the iHar-
mony4 dataset [ 8] to effectively pro-
cess images at various resolutions.
In order to compare AICT with state-
of-the-art methods at ultra-high res-
olutions, we collect two ultra high-
resolution benchmarks (over4K and
over5K) by selecting images with res-
olutions exceeding 4K ( 4096×2160 ) and 5K ( 5120×2880 ) from the HAdobe5k subset. As shown
in Table 9, our method achieves the best performance on the over4K benchmark in terms of fMSE,
MSE, and SSIM, and the second-best performance in terms of SSIM. As shown in Table 10, on the
over5K benchmark, our method achieves the best performance in terms of MSE and PSNR and the
second-best performance in terms of fMSE and SSIM.

Our AICT 154.45 16.79 40.16 0.9898We further compare the FLOPs, mem-
ory cost, and inference time of our
method with state-of-the-art methods
on the HAdobe5k subset. These met-
rics are crucial for evaluating the com-
putational efficiency and scalability of
the models. Our tests were conducted
on a computer equipped with 32GB
of memory and a GeForce GTX 1070
Ti GPU. Tables 11 and 12 show the
comparison results at 1024×1024 and
2048×2048 resolutions, respectively.
At both resolutions, Harmonizer [ 20] has a significant advantage in terms of FLOPs, while DCCF [ 46]
has the lowest memory cost. At a resolution of 1024×1024 , our method is comparable to PCT-
Net [ 12] in FLOPs, memory cost, and inference time. However, at a resolution of 2048×2048 , our
method demonstrates lower memory cost and shorter inference time compared to PCT-Net. One
important reason is that the parameter maps in our method have a fixed size, whereas PCT-Net needs
to align the parameter maps with the composite images, resulting in higher memory consumption and
longer inference time.

Specifically, we compare our pro-
posed method with Harmonizer [ 20],
DCCF [ 46], and PCT-Net [ 12]. The
qualitative results demonstrate that
our method achieves superior harmo-
nization performance, generating im-
ages that closely resemble the ground
truth. Our method excels in adjusting
the overall brightness and preserving
local details in the foreground, leading to more realistic and visually pleasing composite images.

A.3 Evaluation on Real Composite Images
We provide qualitative results on a real composite dataset [ 7], which presents a significant challenge by
combining foreground regions from different light fields with background regions. The resolution of
this dataset ranges from 1024×1024 to6016×4000 pixels. As shown in Figure 8, AICT outperforms
other methods in producing visually superior results in real-world scenarios. The images generated
by AICT show a more harmonious appearance, with both overall brightness and local foreground

and 3, respectively. The mean scores for each method are presented in the table below. As shown in
Table 13, our method achieves the highest score. The above experimental results demonstrate the
superiority and generalizability of our method.
A.4 Broader Impacts
This paper proposes a pixel-wise high-resolution image harmonization method aimed at adjusting the
color of the foreground to seamlessly integrate with the background, thereby enhancing the realism
17of composite images and making a significant contribution to the image composition community.
Simultaneously, our research holds paramount importance in domains such as art, entertainment, and
commerce. However, it is worth noting that image harmonization techniques could potentially be
exploited to create deceptive or misleading visual content. To address this concern, there is a pressing
need for the development of image manipulation detection methods. Additionally, we emphasize the
importance of raising awareness about the capabilities and limitations of such methods to effectively
mitigate their adverse impacts.
A.5 Limitations
A primary limitation of our method lies in its incapability to effectively address foreground elements
like mirrors and glass. This is because the model cannot accurately simulate the interplay between
light and various materials in such scenarios. Figure 9 illustrates some failure cases where our method
struggles to harmonize images containing such elements.

18NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses the limitations of the work performed by the authors in
Section A.5.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
19Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper fully discloses all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper in Section 3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
20Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The data used are publicly available, and the code can be found at https:
//github.com/aipixel/AICT , along with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce
the main experimental results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper specifies all the training and test details in Section 4.1.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The code can be found at https://github.com/aipixel/AICT . The results
can be reproduced using the provided code and the implementation details described in the
paper, so no error bars are reported in this paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
21•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provides sufficient information on the computer resources in Sec-
tion 4.1.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed in Section A.4.
Guidelines:
22• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All assets used in the paper, including code, data, and models, have been prop-
erly credited to their original creators. The licenses are explicitly mentioned in Section 4.1.1
and 4.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
23•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper proposes a new model, and the documentation is provided in
Section 3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
24•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
