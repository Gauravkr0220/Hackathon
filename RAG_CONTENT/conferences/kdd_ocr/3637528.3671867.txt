ABSTRACT
Due to the timeliness and uncertainty of data acquisition, label
shift, which assumes that the source (training) and target (test) la-
bel distributions differ, occurs with the changing environment and
reduces the generalization ability of traditional models. To correct
the label shift, existing methods estimate the true label distribution
by prediction of target data from a source classifier, which results
in high variance, especially with large label shift. In this paper, we
tackle this problem by proposing a novel approach termed as Label
Shift Correction via Bidirectional Marginal Distribution Matching
(BMDM). Our approach matchs the label and feature marginal dis-
tributions simultaneously to ensure the stability of estimated class
proportions. We prove theoretically that there is a unique optimal
solution, i.e., true target label distribution, for our approach under
mild conditions, and an efficient optimization strategy is also pro-
posed. On this basis, in multi-shot scenario where label distribution
changes continuously, we extend BMDM by designing a new distri-
bution matching mechanism and constructing a regularization term
that constrains the direction of label distribution change. Extensive
experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach over
existing state-of-the-arts methods.

The success of traditional machine learning methods relies on the
fundamental assumption that the training and test data are drawn
from the same distribution independently and identically [ 12]. How-
ever, in some open environment applications, data is gathered in a
dynamic way [ 8,24,27,28]. Apart from the timeliness and cumula-
tiveness of data streams, the test (target) distribution always differs
from the training (source) distribution [9, 11, 22, 23]. For example,
in medical image analysis [ 7,14], even if there is not much differ-
ence in symptoms, disease prevalences can also vary significantly in
different seasons. Besides, in plant classification [ 1,16], the types of
popular plants change in different regions, while there is not much
difference in plant characteristics. Specifically, as shown in Figure
1, poplars are mostly found in plain areas, while cacti are mostly
found in desert areas, thus the corresponding optimal classifier
will change accordingly. This phenomenon is an important case of
distribution shift, that is, label shift, based on the assumption that
the source and target distributions have different proportions of cat-
egories(𝑝𝑠(𝑌)≠𝑝𝑡(𝑌)), while the feature distribution is the same
for each category(𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)=𝑝𝑡(𝑋|𝑌)). Researches show that the
change of label marginal distribution can significantly reduce the
generalization performance of traditional models [ 5,13,19,20,26].
Thus, such a shift poses significant challenges for machine learning
systems deployed in the wild.
To overcome the impact of label shift and build a robust model
capable of generalizing well to test samples, current mainstream
methods employ two strategies: confusion matrix and maximum
likelihood estimation [ 3,6,15,25]. For the first strategy, Lipton
et al. [ 10] estimate the important weight using target pseudo la-
bels predicted by the source classifier and the confusion matrix
derived from the predictions and labels of source samples, while a
reweighted framework is used to train the target classifier. On this
basis, Azizzadenesheli et al. [ 4] design a regularized weight estima-
tor to mitigate the influence of large label shift and limited target
samples, and derive the generalization error bound in the finite sam-
ple case. Regarding the second strategy, under the premise of source
classifier calibration, Alexandari et al. [ 2] propose the maximum
likelihood function to estimate the target prior and design a simple
iterative procedure through expectation-maximization algorithm.
Sulc et al. combine the maximum likelihood estimation framework

Figure 1: Illustration of the label shift scenario. In the con-
text of plant classification, the source data originates from
desert areas with a predominant presence of cacti, while the
target data comes from plain areas where poplars are more
prevalent. A shift in the position of the black line signifies a
change in the optimal classifier.
with Dirichlet hyper-prior, and an effective projected gradient de-
scent algorithm is adopted to solve the simplex constraint [ 18]. To
combine the advantages of above two strategies, Sipka et al. employ
confusion matrix to obtain the calibrated target predictions, which
is used in maximum likelihood estimation [17].
Although these approaches have demonstrated remarkable per-
formance in their respective applications, there remain at least two
challenges to be addressed. (1) Most traditional methods heavily
rely on the performance of the source classifier, as the estimation
of weights depends on the confusion matrix and target predic-
tions derived from the source classifier. Consequently, if the source
classifier performs poorly, the bias in weight estimation will be
substantial. (2) The majority of label shift methods are designed to
handle one-shot scenarios. If the label distribution changes over
time, not just once, it is difficult for existing methods to solve this
problem since successive utilization of one-shot method will ignore
the weights estimated in the previous stage and waste information
in the process. Again take plant classification as an example, the
change from desert to plain is gradual rather than sudden, thus the
label distribution of plant changes gradually, which is an urgent
and important challenge.
To effectively address the aforementioned challenges, we pro-
pose a novel method called Label Shift Correction via Bidirectional
Marginal Distribution Matching (BMDM), as depicted in Figure 2.
For the one-shot scenario, we begin by matching the label marginal
distribution between the source and target domains. To ensure the
sufficiency and uniqueness of the solution, we construct a vicarious
convex function. To reduce reliance on the source classifier, feature
marginal distribution is matched through the Bayes formula based
on kernel mean matching and label shift. Subsequently, we integrate
the two matching strategies into a comprehensive framework and
utilize a projected gradient descent algorithm to efficiently handle
the simplex constraint. We further extend BMDM to the multi-shot
scenario, introducing Multi-shot BMDM (MBMDM),which incor-
porates an effective diversity constraint to ensure the direction of
label distribution deviation. The key aspect of this strategy lies ineffectively utilizing the estimated weights from the intermediate
stages, with theoretical guarantees. Finally, extensive experiment
results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our model. In
summary, the contributions of our paper are listed as follows:
•We propose the BMDM approach to address the label shift
problem and extend it to the multi-shot scenario. To the
best of our knowledge, this may be the first study to de-
velop a multi-shot label shift method that effectively utilizes
intermediate information.
•We propose a novel approach that tackles the label shift prob-
lem by simultaneously matching the label and feature mar-
ginal distributions. This not only reduces the performance
requirements of the source classifiers but also guarantees a
unique optimal solution for the objective function.
•We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on multiple
datasets. The experimental results consistently show that our
methods outperform other compared methods in most cases,
especially on the large label shift or multi-shot scenario.
2 THE BMDM ALGORITHM
2.1 Notations
We use random variables 𝑋∈X,𝑌∈Y to represent features
and labels respectively, where X=R𝑑andYis a discrete domain
equivalent to[𝐾]. Here,𝑑is the feature dimension, and 𝐾is the
total number of classes. Let 𝑃𝑠and𝑃𝑡denote the source and target
distributions defined on X×Y . Additionally, 𝑝𝑠and𝑝𝑡are used to
denote the probability density or mass function associated with 𝑃𝑠
and𝑃𝑡. We possess labeled data (𝑋𝑠,𝑌𝑠)={𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1drawn i.i.d.
from the source distribution 𝑃𝑠and unlabeled data 𝑋𝑡={𝑥𝑖}𝑛+𝑚
𝑖=𝑛+1
drawn i.i.d. from the target distribution 𝑃𝑡. We assume access to an
arbitrary classifier 𝑓:X↦→Δ𝐾−1, which is trained to approximate
the source class posterior probability, i.e., 𝑓𝑠(𝑥)≈𝑝𝑠(𝑌|𝑋=𝑥), by
sigmoid function, cross-entropy minimization or whatever. Here
Δ𝐾−1denotes the standard 𝐾-dimensional probability simplex.
Under the label shift assumption, i.e., 𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)=𝑝𝑡(𝑋|𝑌)and
𝑝𝑠(𝑌)≠𝑝𝑡(𝑌), if we give a loss function 𝑙:X×Y→ R1, the goal
of label shift setting is to find an optimal target classifier 𝑓𝑡which
minimizes the following reweighted loss [10]:
L(𝑓)=E(𝑋,𝑌)∼𝑃𝑡[𝑙(𝑓𝑡(𝑋),𝑌)]=E(𝑋,𝑌)∼𝑃𝑠𝑝𝑡(𝑌)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌)𝑙(𝑓𝑡(𝑋),𝑌)
.
(1)
In practice, since the source label distribution 𝑝𝑠(𝑌)can naturally
be estimated by directly computing the proportion of source labels,
denoted as𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)=1
𝑛𝑘Í𝑛𝑘
𝑖=11{𝑌𝑖=𝑘}, where𝑛𝑘the number of
samples in𝑘-th class. Therefore, the key challenge lies in estimating
the target label distribution 𝑝𝑡(𝑌).
2.2 Core Algorithm
First, let us analyze the relationship between the distribution of
features and the distribution of labels. Utilizing Bayes formula, we
can express this relationship as follows:
𝑝𝑡(𝑌|𝑋)=𝑝𝑡(𝑌,𝑋)
𝑝𝑡(𝑋)=𝑝𝑡(𝑋|𝑌)𝑝𝑡(𝑌)
𝑝𝑡(𝑋)=𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)𝑝𝑡(𝑌)
𝑝𝑡(𝑋)
=𝑝𝑠(𝑋,𝑌)𝑝𝑡(𝑌)
𝑝𝑡(𝑋)𝑝𝑠(𝑌)=𝑝𝑠(𝑌|𝑋)𝑝𝑡(𝑌)𝑝𝑠(𝑋)
𝑝𝑡(𝑋)𝑝𝑠(𝑌).(2)

Figure 2: Illustration of BMDM. On the left side, a calibrated source classifier is utilized to predict labels for the target data,
enabling label matching. Conversely, on the right side, the feature matching is performed using only the source and target
data without labels, ensuring that the performance is independent of the quality of the classifier. By combining these two
components, optimal weight estimation is achieved, leading to the acquisition of the weighted target classifier (depicted in red)
through the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework.
According to the properties of conditional distribution, the equationÍ𝐾
𝑘=1𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)=1always holds. Combined with Eq. (2), the
following formulas remain valid.
 
𝑝𝑡(𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑋)=𝐾Í
𝑖=1𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑖)𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖),
𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)=𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑘)𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)
𝐾Í
𝑖=1𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑖)𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖),𝑘∈[𝐾].(3)
Building upon this foundation, we will demonstrate how to estimate
the importance weight through bidirectional marginal distribution
matching.
2.2.1 Label Marginal Distribution Matching. Given the weight
variables𝜃=[𝜃1,𝜃2,...,𝜃𝐾] ∈R𝐾,∀𝑘∈ [𝐾],0≤𝜃𝑘≤1and
𝜃∗:=𝑝𝑡(𝑌), we define the weighted class posterior distribution as
follows:
𝑝𝜃
𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)=𝜃𝑘𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)
Í𝐾
𝑖=1𝜃𝑖𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖), 𝑘∈[𝐾].(4)
According to Eq. (3), if 𝜃=𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌),𝑝𝜃∗
𝑠(𝑌|𝑋)=𝑝𝑡(𝑌|𝑋)is
always holds. Then, we define the weight class marginal distribution
as follows:
𝑝𝜃
𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)=E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)h
𝑝𝜃
𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)i
=E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)"
𝜃𝑘𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)
Í𝐾
𝑖=1𝜃𝑖𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖)#
.(5)
If𝜃=𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌), The following conclusion is valid.
𝑝𝜃∗
𝑠(𝑌)=E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)h
𝑝𝜃∗
𝑠(𝑌|𝑋)i
=E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)[𝑝𝑡(𝑌|𝑋)]
=∫
𝑝𝑡(𝑌|𝑋)𝑝𝑡(𝑋)𝑑𝑋=𝑝𝑡(𝑌)=𝜃∗.(6)This observation motivates us to transform the estimation of 𝑝𝑡(𝑌)
into a weighted marginal distribution matching problem. Specifi-
cally, we aim to find a weighted distribution 𝑝𝜃𝑠(𝑌)=𝜃, which can
be expressed using the following formula.
𝜃𝑘=E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)"
𝜃𝑘𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)
Í𝐾
𝑖=1𝜃𝑖𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖)#
:=[𝑇(𝜃;𝑋)]𝑘, 𝑘∈[𝐾],(7)
where[·]𝑘denotes the 𝑘-th component of a vector. The equation
𝜃=𝑇(𝜃;𝑋)can be considered as a non-linear equation. One com-
monly used approach to obtain a solution for this non-linear equa-
tion is through fixed-point iteration. However, it should be noted
that since𝑇is not a contraction mapping, fixed-point iteration alone
is not enough to guarantee convergence to the optimal solution.
To address the aforementioned issue, we construct an auxiliary
optimization function with the following specific form:
 
min
𝜃E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)h
−logÍ𝐾
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)i
,
𝑠.𝑡.Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘=1,𝜃𝑘≥0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾].(8)
Due to the concavity of the logarithmic function and the linearity
of the constraint, Eq. (8) is a convex problem. It possesses a unique
solution, denoted as 𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌), as demonstrated in Theorem 2.1.
Theorem 2.1. The optimal solution of Eq. (8) must satisfy the non-
linear Eq. (7). Further, if the set of distributions {𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑘),𝑘∈
[𝐾]}are linearly independent, Eq. (8) has the unique solution 𝜃∗=
𝑝𝑡(𝑌).
Please refer to the Appendix B.1 for a detailed proof. It is impor-
tant to note that the linearly independent property is commonly
utilized as a fundamental condition in label shift problems. Thus,
this is reasonable to utilize Eq. (8) to match the label distribution.

2.2.2 Feature Marginal Distribution Matching. Building on
the Bayes formula, 𝑝𝑠(𝑋)=Í𝐾
𝑖=1𝑝𝑠(𝑋,𝑌=𝑖)=Í𝐾
𝑖=1𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=
𝑖)𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑖)always hold for∀𝑋∈X. We now define a family of
weighted feature marginal distribution over 𝑋parameterized by 𝜃
as
𝑝𝜃
𝑠(𝑋)=𝐾∑︁
𝑖=1𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑖)𝜃𝑖. (9)
Due to the label shift assumption 𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)=𝑝𝑡(𝑋|𝑌), if𝜃=𝑝𝑡(𝑌),
we have that 𝑝𝜃𝑠(𝑋)=𝑝𝑡(𝑋). Thus one efficient strategy to match
the feature marginal distribution is to find a vector 𝜃such that
𝐾∑︁
𝑖=1𝜃𝑖𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑖)=𝑝𝑡(𝑋),∀𝑋∈X. (10)
We show that the optimal solution of Eq. (10) is unique under the
same mild condition as in Theorem 2.1.
Theorem 2.2. If the set of distributions {𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑘),𝑘∈[𝐾]}
are linearly independent, then for any 𝜃∗that satisfies Eq. (10), it
follows that 𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌).
Please refer to the Appendix B.2 for a detailed proof. To enforce
the matching between 𝑝𝜃𝑠(𝑋)and𝑝𝑡(𝑋)effectively, we employ the
Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) for two distributions and obtain the
squared Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss:
min
𝜃E𝑋∼𝑝𝜃𝑠(𝑋)[𝜑(𝑋)]−E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)[𝜑(𝑋)]2
, (11)
where𝜑(·)is a kernel mapping. On this basis, we have
E𝑋∼𝑝𝜃𝑠(𝑋)[𝜑(𝑋)]=∫
𝜑(𝑋)𝑝𝜃
𝑠(𝑋)𝑑𝑋
=∬
𝜑(𝑋)𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)𝜃𝑑𝑋𝑑𝑌 =∬
𝑝𝑠(𝑋,𝑌)𝜃𝜑(𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌)𝑑𝑋𝑑𝑌
=E(𝑋,𝑌)∼𝑝𝑠(𝑋,𝑌)𝜃𝜑(𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌)
.(12)
Combined with Eq. (12), the loss Eq. (11) is the same as
min
𝜃E(𝑋,𝑌)∼𝑝𝑠(𝑋,𝑌)𝜃𝜑(𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌)
−E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)[𝜑(𝑋)]2
. (13)
Therefore, we adopt Eq. (13) to match the feature marginal distri-
bution. It is worth noting that the feature marginal distribution
matching is independent of the class posterior distribution 𝑃𝑠(𝑌|𝑋).
Hence, this estimation is not influenced by the quality of the source
classifier.
2.2.3 Overall Framework. Based on the above information, we
can estimate the true target label distribution 𝑝𝑡(𝑌)by matching
the feature and label distribution at the same time. The overall loss
function is

−E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)[𝜑(𝑋)]2
,
𝑠.𝑡.Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘=1,𝜃𝑘≥0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾].
(14)
where𝜆∈[0,1]is the parameter that tradeoffs the loss between
two types of distribution matching. It is obvious that 𝜃=𝑝𝑡(𝑌)is
the optimal solution of Eq. (14) according to Theorem 2.1 and 2.2.Using the labeled source samples {𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1and the unlabeled
target samples{𝑥𝑖}𝑛+𝑚
𝑖=𝑛+1, we approximate the expectation with its
empirical average and obtain the following optimization problem:

𝑘=1𝜃𝑘=1,𝜃𝑘≥0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾].(15)
Since𝑝𝑠(𝑌|𝑋)is unknown, let us approximate it by the output of
the source classifier. In addition, we construct the representation
vectors𝑑𝑖=hI(𝑦𝑖=1)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌=1),I(𝑦𝑖=2)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌=2),...,I(𝑦𝑖=𝐾)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝐾)i

we design the transformation matrix D∈R𝑛×𝑛, where the 𝑖-th

where the constant term of Eq. (16) is ignored. Optimization strate-
gies for the above problem are shown in the Appendix A.1.
2.3 Reweighted Framework
After get the estimated parameter ˆ𝜃, we can now correct the source
classifier. Specifically, Our goal is to find a new calssifier 𝑓𝑡(·)which
minimizes
𝐿(𝑓𝑡)=𝐸(𝑋,𝑌)∼𝑃𝑡(𝑋,𝑌)[𝑙(𝑌,𝑓𝑡(𝑋))]
=𝐸(𝑋,𝑌)∼𝑃𝑠(𝑋,𝑌)[𝑝𝑡(𝑌)𝑙(𝑌,𝑓𝑡(𝑋))/𝑝𝑠(𝑌)].(18)
In the typical finite sample scenario, we lack knowledge of the dis-
tribution of the source domain and only have access to the observed
source data{𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1. As a result, we need to seek the minimizer of
the empirical loss using the importance weighted ERM framework.
𝐿(𝑓𝑡;ˆ𝜃)=1

3 MULTI-SHOT BMDM
In the previous subsection, we presented our basic strategy for
the one-shot case. In this section, we extend our approach to the
multi-shot scenario and propose the Multi-shot BMDM (MBMDM)
method to address the challenge of effectively utilizing the esti-
mated weights from intermediate processes. In many real-world
applications, the label shift occurs gradually over multiple stages,
which is often overlooked by existing label shift methods. Figure
 
738Label Shift Correction via Bidirectional Marginal Distribution Matching KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
Figure 3: Illustration of multi-shot label shift scenario. In
plant classification, the data comes in the form of a block
stream, and correspondingly, the label distribution changes.
3 provides a brief overview of the notations used in the multi-
shot case, following a similar structure as Figure 1. Assume there
are𝑅stages of gradual change, and the corresponding probability
density or mass functions are denoted as {𝑝𝑡1(·),...,𝑝𝑡𝑅(·)}, where
𝑝𝑡1(·)=𝑝𝑠(·). We make the following assumption:
Assumption 1. For progressive label shift, the class-conditional
distribution remains unchanged, i.e., 𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)=𝑝𝑡1(𝑋|𝑌)=...=
𝑝𝑡𝑅(𝑋|𝑌), and the label marginal distribution changes gradually, i.e.,
𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑌)=𝛾𝑟𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌)+(1−𝛾𝑟)𝑝𝑡𝑟+1(𝑌), where𝑟∈[2,3,...,𝑅−1]
and𝛾𝑟∈(0,1).
Our goal is to obtain the corrected labels in the final stage, which
is equivalent to estimate 𝑝𝑡𝑅(𝑌|𝑋). However, directly scaling the
one-shot BMDM formulation from Eq. (17) poses several challenges:
(1) It is challenging to effectively utilize the properties of the inter-
mediate label distributions. (2) Storing data at all stages may lead to
an excessive burden. (3) Carrying out multi-stage transformations
can result in high computational complexity.
To overcome the above difficulties, we propose the following
strategy. In the 𝑟-th stage, assuming that we can only utilize data
from the previous and current stages {𝑋𝑠,𝑋𝑟}, the pseudo labels
obtained from the previous stage ˆ𝑌𝑟−1, the estimated label distribu-
tions{ˆ𝑝𝑠(𝑌),ˆ𝑝𝑟−1(𝑌)}and the source classifier 𝑓(·). Similar to the
one-shot case, we try to solve the above problem from the perspec-
tive of bidirectional distributed matching. Our estimator consists
of three main components:
(1). In the𝑟-th stage, to match the label marginal distribution,
we employ a similar approach to Eq. (8), yielding:
 
min
𝜃E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑋)h
−logÍ𝐾

𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌=𝑘)i
,
𝑠.𝑡.Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘=1,𝜃𝑘≥0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾],(20)
where the optimal solution is 𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑌). However, it is tedious
to estimate𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋∼𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑋))due to the absence of (𝑟−1)-
th stage classifier. In order to address this issue, we propose the
following theorem:Theorem 3.1.∀𝑋∼𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑋), the following equation holds
𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌|𝑋)
𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌)=𝑐𝑟−1(𝑋)𝑝𝑠(𝑌|𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌),∀𝑟∈{2,3,...,𝑅}, (21)
where𝑐(𝑋)is a cluster of constants independent of 𝑌.
Please refer to the Appendix B.3 for a detailed proof. Building
upon Theorem 3.1, the optimization problem Eq.(20) is transformed
as follows:
 
min
𝜃E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑋)h

,
𝑠.𝑡.Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘=1,𝜃𝑘≥0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾].
(22)
SinceE𝑋∼𝑝𝑠(𝑋)[log𝑐𝑟−1(𝑋)]is a constant which is not related to
the optimization of 𝜃, we can ignore it.
(2). In the𝑟-th stage, to match the feature marginal distribution,
similar to Eq. (16), we need to optimize the following problem,
min
𝜃𝜃TDTK𝑠D𝜃
𝑛2−21TK𝑟,𝑠D𝜃
𝑛𝑛𝑟. (23)
(3). To reuse the previous label distributions 𝑝𝑠(𝑌),𝑝𝑟−1(𝑌), we
aim to design a regularization term under Assumption 1. Prior to
that, we assert the following theorem to be valid.
Theorem 3.2.∃𝛾∈Rwhich is determined by {𝛾𝑗}𝑟−1
𝑗=1, the fol-
lowing equation holds
𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑌)−𝑝𝑠(𝑌)=𝛾 𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌)−𝑝𝑠(𝑌). (24)
Please refer to the Appendix B.4 for a detailed proof. Hence, we
observe that{𝑝𝑡𝑖(𝑌)}𝑟
𝑖=1lies on a straight line in the 𝐾-dimensional
space. However, as the parameter 𝛾is unknown, it is not possible to
directly obtain 𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑌)by Eq. (24). Therefore, we propose optimizing
the angle between pairwise vectors, i.e.,
arg min

1−
𝜃−𝑝𝑠(𝑌),𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌)−𝑝𝑠(𝑌)
∥𝜃−𝑝𝑠(𝑌)∥𝑝𝑡𝑟−1(𝑌)−𝑝𝑠(𝑌)!
. (25)
If𝜃=𝑝𝑡𝑟(𝑌), the above loss reaches the minimum value 0.
To sum up, we propose the following loss function for MBMDM:

4 EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets.We conduct performance evaluations of BMDM and
MBMDM using artificial shifts on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CI-
FAR100 datasets. In the first, each dataset is divided into two parts:
the source and target domain randomly. Then, we consider two
types of shift in our experiments: (1) Tweak-One shift, which makes
the probability of a certain source class change to 𝜌, and the prob-
ability of other source classes keep the same ratio. (2) Dirichlet
 
739KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Ruidong Fan, Xiao Ouyang, Hong Tao, and Chenping Hou
shift, which generates a Dirichlet distribution by the concentration
parameter𝛼and makes the source label scale consistent with it.
We then sample the source and target domain data based on the
aforementioned proportions, creating the source and target sets,
respectively. For the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, we use 10,000
source and 8,000 target samples. Considering the larger number
of categories, we set the number of source and target samples as
20,000 and 10,000, respectively, for the CIFAR100 dataset.
Compared methods. In the experiment, we compare BMDM
and MBMDM with several advanced label shift methods to show-
case their performance. The methods we consider are as follows:
(1) BBSE (2018) and RLLS (2019): These label shift methods are
based on hard confusion matrix. Additionally, we have BBSE-soft
and RLLS-soft, which are extensions of the former methods based
on soft confusion matrix. (2) EM (2020): A representative method
based on maximum likelihood estimation. Moreover, based on this
approach, we have MAP (2019), which assumes that the source
label distribution follows a given prior. (3) SML (2022): This method
combines the EM method with a soft confusion matrix. (4) WW: A
variant that demonstrates unweighted performance.
Network architecture and evaluation indicators. All meth-
ods have the flexibility to utilize any classifier as the base classifier
for estimating their weights. Additionally, when other conditions
remain unchanged, a more accurate base (source) classifier leads to
more accurate estimated weights and a reweighted target classifier.
In our experiment, we employ a two-layer fully connected neural
network for the MNIST dataset, and ResNet18 for the CIFAR10
and CIFAR100 datasets. For each shift type, we randomly sample
10 times for each distribution parameter to evaluate the F-score,
Accuracy (Acc), and Mean Square Error (MSE) of the estimated
weights. To be specific, MSE is defined as follows:
MSE(ˆ𝜃)=1
len(𝜃)ˆ𝜃
ˆ𝑝𝑠(𝑌)−𝑝𝑡(𝑌)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌)2
. (27)
Parameter setting. For the compared methods, all the parame-
ters are determined according to the strategies provided by their
respective references. In the case of BMDM, the bandwidth parame-
ter𝛿of the kernel matrices is fixed at 1, and the balance parameter
𝜆is selected from the set {0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1}. As for MBMDM,
we set the parameter 𝜔from the set{10−3,10−2,10−1,1,10,100}.
The optimal combination of parameters is chosen based on the
validation set. Additionally, we choose the values of 𝛼from the set
{0.5,1,5}(where smaller values of 𝛼result in more extreme label
shift), and the values of 𝜌from the set{0.5,0.7,0.9}(where larger
values of𝜌result in more extreme label shift).
4.2 BMDM Performance Comparison
Firstly, to verify the validity of the proposed BMDM, we compare
it with advanced label shift methods, and investigate F-score, Acc
and MSE on the Dirichlet and Tweak-One shift datasets. It’s worth
noting that we make the proportion of 10 classes sum to 𝜌on
Tweak-One shift CIFAR100 dataset due to the large number of
classes. All methods run on framework with Python 3.7. The exper-
imental results are displayed in Table 1 and we have the following
observations.(1) The results presented in Table 1 demonstrate that in most
cases, BMDM outperforms other approaches in terms of both mean
and variance. This indicates an improvement in effectiveness and
stability. (2) Generally, BMDM performs better with larger label
shifts, thanks to its feature matching strategy. With increased label
shift, the performance of the source classifier tends to decrease,
leading to a decline in the accuracy of estimated weights. However,
since feature matching is not affected by the source classifier’s
performance, the accuracy and stability of weight estimation can
be enhanced. (3) The MSE solely depends on the estimated weights,
whereas Acc and F-score are influenced not only by the estimated
weights but also by the reweighting framework. Therefore, MSE can
provide a more intuitive measure of the effectiveness of the methods.
It can be observed that although our method may show only slight
improvements in Acc and F-score for some datasets, there is a
significant improvement in the MSE. This further illustrates the
effectiveness of our approach.
4.3 MBMDM Performance Comparison
In this case, in addition to the previous compared approaches, we
also make a comparison with BMDM. We divide each data into
source, middle and target sets, which is equivalent to a three-
shot scenario. The amount of data in the source and target sets
is consistent with that in one-shot scenario and the data amount
of middle set is 8000 for all datasets. Compared approaches that
include BMDM are trained only on the source and target sets with
Dirichlet parameter 𝛼∈{0.1,0.3}. To make sure the data meets
our multi-stage assumption, we set the middle distribution to be
𝑃𝑟(𝑌)=0.5𝑝𝑠(𝑌)+0.5𝑃𝑡(𝑌)and sample accordingly. We report the
experimental results in Table 2 and there are several observations
as follows.
(1) The performance of our BMDM and MBMDM is still better
than other approaches in most cases. (2) Compared with BMDM,
MBMDM delivers improvements across all datasets, which shows
the validity of the regularization constraint we designed. Interest-
ingly, it can be seen that Acc and F-score show a trend of reverse
improvement with the increase of label shift degree.
4.4 Performance Analyses
We further analyze the performance of our proposed BMDM and
MBMDM from different aspects in this subsection.
4.4.1 The influence of base classifiers. As observed in Figure
4, we employed MLP and ResNet18 as the base classifiers on the
CIFAR10 dataset to investigate their impact on model performance.
Through our analysis, we discovered that as the base classifier’s
performance improves, the estimated weight becomes more accu-
rate, subsequently leading to an enhancement in the performance
of the target classifier as well.
4.4.2 Convergence analysis. As depicted in Algorithm 1, we
employ a linear search technique to guarantee the convergence of
the gradient descent method. For illustrative purposes, we showcase
the objective function values in Figure 5, and the experimental
results validate the convergence of both BMDM and MBMDM. It is
evident that our optimization algorithm converges rapidly, typically
requiring fewer than 30 iterations.

742Label Shift Correction via Bidirectional Marginal Distribution Matching KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
becomes more pronounced. This can be attributed to the fact that
larger label shifts lead to less accurate weight estimation, requiring
a greater amount of target data to compensate for the estimation
error. (2) MBMDM is less affected by the amount of target data
compared to BMDM. This is due to the fact that the target weight
estimation in MBMDM is influenced by the intermediate weight,
making it less sensitive to variations in the volume of target data.
4.4.4 Parameter analysis. In our BMDM method, we have a
parameter𝜆, while in MBMDM, we have another parameter 𝜔. In
this subsection, we illustrate the impact of different values of 𝜆
and𝜔on our BMDM and MBMDM methods, as shown in Figure 7.
Based on our observations, we make the following remarks:
(1) In the case of BMDM, we observe that the parameter 𝜆sig-
nificantly influences the experimental results. This finding demon-
strates the effectiveness of our bidirectional matching strategy. (2)
In the case of MBMDM, the method is not highly sensitive to the
parameter𝜔within a certain range. This characteristic simplifies
the adjustment of the parameter 𝜔.

4.4.5 The impact of the number of stages. To assess the im-
pact of the number of stages R, we conducted 4-shot and 5-shot
experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset with 𝛼=0.3,
where the label distributions are defined as follows: For 4-shot:
𝑝𝑡(𝑌)=1
3𝑃𝑠(𝑌)+1
3𝑃1(𝑌)+1
3𝑃2(𝑌); For 5-shot: 𝑝𝑡(𝑌)=1
4𝑃𝑠(𝑌)+
1
4𝑃1(𝑌)+1
4𝑃2(𝑌)+1
4𝑃3(𝑌). From the experimental results as shown
in Figure 8, it can be observed that as the number of stages R
increases, the estimation of the label distribution becomes more
accurate, leading to improved model performance.
4.4.6 Confusion matrix .As illustrated in Figure 9, we visualize
the confusion matrix for both BMDM and MBMDM to demonstrate
the accuracy achieved for each class. It is evident that we have
obtained favorable results for the majority of classes. However, in
some cases where performance is subpar, label shift appears to be

the primary contributing factor. Furthermore, we observed that the
confusion matrices contain significant values in several off-diagonal
positions, indicating a potential correlation among misclassified
classes.

5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have tackled the challenge of classification under
label shift and introduced two bidirectional marginal distribution
matching methods for both scenarios. Our methods prove to be
particularly effective in scenarios with large label shifts. We have
provided theoretical assurance that the objective function possesses
a unique optimal solution, namely the true target label distribution.
This insight offers valuable guidance for the development of label
shift methods. The experimental results, both in the one-shot and
multi-shot settings, have demonstrated the superiority of our pro-
posed methods. Moving forward, we plan to extend our approach to
the generalized label shift setting, which imposes stringent require-
ments on aligning conditional distributions. Furthermore, exploring
the integration of classifier learning and weight estimation is among
the directions for future research.

A OPTIMIZATION
A.1 BMDM Optimization
For BMDM, since we have utilized both negative log loss and con-
strained regularizers, it is difficult to derive a closed-form solution.
A natural iterative approach to this problem is Projected Gradient
Descent(PGD):
𝜃𝑡+1=ΠΔ 𝜃𝑡−𝜂𝑡∇𝐿 𝜃𝑡, (28)
where𝑡is the number of iterations, 𝜂𝑡is step size determined
by inexact linear search, ∇𝐿 𝜃𝑡is the gradient of function 𝐿at
point𝜃𝑡andΠΔ(.)is a projection onto the standard simplex Δ=

Assume that 𝑧𝑡+1=𝜃𝑡−𝜂𝑡∇𝐿 𝜃𝑡, then Eq .(29) can be replaced
by the following optimization problem:
(
𝜃𝑡+1=arg min𝜃𝜃−𝑧𝑡+12
𝑠.𝑡.Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘=1,𝜃≥0.(30)
Due to the strong convexity of the objective function and the linear-
ity of the constraints, there is a unique solution. We adopt Lagrange
multiplier method to solve the above optimization problem with
constraints [21] and the Lagrangian function is
L(𝜃,𝛼,𝛽)=1
2𝜃−𝑧𝑡+12−𝛼
𝜃T1−1
−𝛽T𝜃, (31)
where𝜃and𝛽=[𝛽1;...;𝛽𝐾]are the Lagrange multipliers for the
equality and inequality constraints, respectively. The KKT condi-
tions which need to be satisfied by optimal solutions are shown as
follows:
 
𝜃𝑘−𝑧𝑡+1
𝑘−𝛼−𝛽𝑘=0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾]
𝜃𝑘≥0, 𝛽𝑘≥0, 𝛽𝑘𝜃𝑘=0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾]Í𝐾
𝑖=1𝜃𝑖=1.(32)
From the second complementarity condition of Eq. (32), it is obvious
that if𝜃𝑘=0, then𝛽𝑖≥0, which is equal to 𝑧𝑡+1
𝑘+𝛼=−𝛽𝑖≤0;
if𝜃𝑘>0, then𝛽𝑖=0and𝜃𝑘=𝑧𝑡+1
𝑘+𝛼>0. Thus, the zero com-
ponents in the optimal solution correspond to the smaller partial
components of 𝑧𝑡+1. For clarity, we sort the components of 𝑧𝑡+1
and𝜃in the same order, i.e.,
𝑧𝑡+1
1≥...≥𝑧𝑡+1
𝜌>𝑧𝑡+1
𝜌+1≥...≥𝑧𝑡+1
𝐾,
𝜃1≥...≥𝜃𝜌>𝜃𝜌+1=...=𝜃𝐾=0,(33)

Hence𝜌is the key of this question. Once we obtain 𝜌, it is natural to
get the Lagrange multiplier 𝛼, and then obtain the optimal solution
𝜃𝑘=max{0,𝑧𝑡+1
𝑘+𝛼},∀𝑘∈[𝐾]. Since𝑧𝑡+1is ordered, we find that
the parameter 𝜌needs to satisfy the following properties:

proof since if we can prove 𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌)is the unique solution of Eq.

(1) Sufficiency. Since Eq. (8) belongs to constraint optimization,
we change it to an unconstrained form by the Lagrange multiplier

where𝛾is a Lagrange multiplier and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucke (KKT)
conditions for the Lagrange function is given as follows:

Thus,∀𝑘∈[𝐾],E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)
𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)/𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)Í𝐾

Therefore, the optimal solution of Eq. (8) must satisfy the fixed
point equation Eq. (7). that is, the sufficiency of solution is proved.
(2) Uniqueness. In the first, we prove that 𝜃=𝑝𝑡(𝑌)is one
of the optimal solutions of Eq. (8). Specifically, we prove that it
satisfies the KKT conditions Eq. (40). For the first condition, we

where 1○holds due to the optimal distribution matching Eq. (6). In
addition, for the second condition, we have
𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝜃𝑘−1=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑘)−1=0. (44)
Thus,𝜃=𝑝𝑡(𝑌)satisfies the KKT conditions. Next, we prove that
𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌)is the unique solution of Eq. (8). If there exists another
optimal soulution ˜𝜃≠𝜃∗, the objective function values of both are
equal, i.e.,
E𝑋∼𝑝𝑡(𝑋)"

Thus, we have

=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1
𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑘)−˜𝜃𝑘
𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘)𝑝𝑠(𝑌=𝑘|𝑋)
=0.(46)
Since the set of distributions {𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑘),𝑘∈[𝐾]}are linearly
independent, we have
𝑝𝑡(𝑌=𝑘)−˜𝜃𝑘=0,∀𝑘∈[𝐾]. (47)
This contradicts the assumption that ˜𝜃≠𝑝𝑡(𝑌), thus Eq. (8) has a
unique solution. □
B.2 Proof of Theorem 2
Proof. If there exists 𝜃≠𝜃∗that satisfies Eq. (10), then we
haveÍ𝐾
𝑖=1(𝜃𝑖−𝜃∗
𝑖)𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑖)=0. Since the set of distribu-
tions{𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑘),𝑘∈[𝐾]}are linearly independent,Í𝐾
𝑖=1(𝜃𝑖−
𝜃∗
𝑖)𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌=𝑖)=0is equal to𝜃−𝜃∗=0. This contradicts the previ-
ous conclusion. Thus Eq. (10) has a unique solution 𝜃∗=𝑝𝑡(𝑌).□
B.3 Proof of Theorem 3
Proof. Assume that the data flow is in phase 𝑟, based on the
label shift assumption 𝑝𝑠(𝑋|𝑌)=𝑝𝑡1(𝑋|𝑌)=...=𝑝𝑡𝑅(𝑋|𝑌), wehave the following conclusion
𝑝𝑟−1(𝑌|𝑋)=𝑝𝑟−1(𝑌,𝑋)
𝑝𝑟−1(𝑋)=𝑝𝑟−1(𝑋|𝑌)𝑝𝑟−1(𝑌)
𝑝𝑟−1(𝑋)
=𝑝𝑟−2(𝑋|𝑌)𝑝𝑟−1(𝑌)

If we set𝑐𝑟−1(𝑋)=𝑝𝑠(𝑋)
𝑝𝑟−1(𝑋), this theorem is proved. □
B.4 Proof of Theorem 4
