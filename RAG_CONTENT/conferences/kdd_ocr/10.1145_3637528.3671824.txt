ABSTRACT
Collaborative Filtering (CF) typically suffers from the significant
challenge of popularity bias due to the uneven distribution of items
in real-world datasets. This bias leads to a significant accuracy gap
between popular and unpopular items. It not only hinders accurate
user preference understanding but also exacerbates the Matthew ef-
fect in recommendation systems. To alleviate popularity bias, exist-
ing efforts focus on emphasizing unpopular items or separating the
correlation between item representations and their popularity. De-
spite the effectiveness, existing works still face two persistent chal-
lenges: (1) how to extract common supervision signals from popular
items to improve the unpopular item representations, and (2) how
to alleviate the representation separation caused by popularity bias.
In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of popularity bias
and propose Popularity- Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to
address two challenges. Specifically, we use the common super-
visory signals modeled in popular item representations and pro-
pose a novel popularity-aware supervised alignment module to
learn unpopular item representations. Additionally, we suggest
re-weighting the contrastive learning loss to mitigate the repre-
sentation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. Finally,
we validate the effectiveness and rationale of PAAC in mitigating
popularity bias through extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/miaomiao-

1 INTRODUCTION
Modern recommender systems play a crucial role in mitigating
information overload [ 3,11,27,45,48]. Collaborative filtering (CF)
is widely used in personalized recommendations to help users find
items of potential interest. CF-based methods primarily learn user
preferences and item characteristics by aligning the representations
of users and the items they interact with [ 19,42]. Despite their
success, CF-based methods often face popularity bias [ 6,35], result-
ing in significant accuracy gaps between popular and unpopular
items [ 38,58]. Popularity bias stems from the limited supervisory
signals for unpopular items, causing overfitting during training
and reducing performance on the test set. It hinders the accurate
understanding of user preferences, decreasing recommendation
diversity [ 5,16,25]. What’s even worse is that popularity bias may
exacerbate the Matthew effect, where popular items become even
more popular due to frequent recommendations [35, 57].
Mitigating popularity bias in recommendation systems, as de-
scribed in Figure. 1, presents two primary and significant chal-
lenges. The first challenge arises from insufficient representations
of unpopular items during training, leading to overfitting and poor
generalization performance. The second challenge, representation

separation, occurs when popular and unpopular items are modeled
into different semantic spaces, exacerbating bias and reducing rec-
ommendation accuracy. Next, we will explore these challenges and
discuss potential solutions to mitigate popularity bias.
Due to the limited supervisory signals for unpopular items, their
representations are insufficient leading to overfitting. During train-
ing, representation alignment focuses on users and the items they
have interacted with [ 24,30]. However, due to limited interactions,
unpopular items are often modeled around a small number of users.
This focused modeling can lead to overfitting due to the insufficient
representations of unpopular items. As shown in the left part of
Figure.1, we divide items into popular and unpopular groups based
on the Pareto principle [ 43]. And then evaluate their performance
in both training and testing sets (measured using 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @100).
The results reveal that traditional methods achieve higher accu-
racy for unpopular items during training but significantly lower
accuracy during testing, indicating clear overfitting. To address this
issue, previous studies have tried to boost the training weights or
prediction scores for unpopular items, such as IPS [ 58], MACR [ 38],
and others [ 5,9,55]. However, as shown in Figure.1, overfitting
still exists even with augmented supervisory weights for unpopular
items. This may be because unpopular items still lack sufficient
supervisory signals, leading to inadequate representation capability.
Therefore, how to enhance the representation modeling of
unpopular items remains a challenge.
Recent studies indicate that popularity bias causes representation
separation in item embeddings [ 50,54]. Specifically, the model rep-
resents popular and unpopular items in different semantic spaces
according to their popularity levels. As shown in the right part
of Figure.1, we train LightGCN[ 13] on the Yelp2018 dataset1, ran-
domly selected users and items, and visualize them using t-SNE [ 29]
dimensionality reduction. The blue dots represent unpopular items,
the yellow dots represent popular items, and the orange dots rep-
resent users. As seen, there is a clear distinction in the positions
of unpopular and popular items in the representation space. User
representations show a preference for popular items, exacerbating
popularity bias. Existing methods try to alleviate representation sep-
aration by either removing the correlation between item represen-
tations and popularity [ 1,38,41] or enhancing overall consistency
1https://www.yelp.com/datasetthrough contrastive learning [ 31,50]. However, blindly removing
popularity information can harm recommendation accuracy [ 5].
While contrastive learning methods improve recommendation per-
formance, they often worsen representation separation by pushing
positive and negative samples apart. When negative samples follow
the popularity distribution [ 4,50], most are popular items. Optimiz-
ing for unpopular items as positive samples pushes popular items
further away, intensifying representation separation. Conversely,
when negative samples follow a uniform distribution [ 49], most
are unpopular items. Optimizing for popular items as positive sam-
ples separates them from most unpopular items, again worsening
representation separation. Therefore, how to effectively solve
representation separation is also crucial.
In this work, we conduct a analysis of popularity bias and pro-
pose Popularity- Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to address
two challenges. Our model PAAC primarily consists of the follow-
ing two modules: (1) Supervised Alignment Module: To enhance
the representations of unpopular items with more supervision sig-
nals, we use common supervisory signals modeled in popular item
representations and propose a popularity-aware supervised align-
ment module. Intuitively, items interacted with by the same user
share similar characteristics. By leveraging similar characteristics
modeled in popular item representation, we propose to align the
representations of popular and unpopular items interacted with by
the same user. (2) Re-weighting Contrast Module: To better alle-
viate representation separation, we propose a re-weighting contrast
module from a popularity-centric perspective. Considering the influ-
ence of various popularity levels on recommendation performance
as positive and negative samples, we introduce hyperparameters
𝛾and𝛽to control the weighting of samples with different item
popularity levels. Our contributions can be summarized in three
key points:
•To provide more supervisory signals for unpopular items, we
leverage common characteristics modeled in popular item rep-
resentations and propose a popularity-aware supervised align-
ment module to enhance the unpopular item representations.
•To more effectively alleviate representation separation, we pro-
pose a re-weighting contrast module from a popularity-centric
perspective, re-weighting the positive and negative samples.
•Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demon-
strate the effectiveness and rationale of PAAC in mitigating
popularity bias.
2 PRELIMINARY
2.1 Collaborative Filtering
The core of CF-based models is to learn user preferences and item
characteristics by aligning user and item representations based
on their interactions [ 10,30]. Based on these representations, the
trained model predicts potential interactions for recommendation [ 20].
Specifically, let 𝑼(|𝑼|=𝑀) and 𝑰(|𝑰|=𝑁) represent the sets of
users and items, respectively. In the implicit feedback setting, the
observed interactions are represented by the matrix R∈ 0,1𝑀×𝑁,
whereR𝑢,𝑖=1indicates an interaction between user 𝑢and item𝑖,
andR𝑢,𝑖=0indicates no interaction. To better learn user prefer-
ences and item characteristics, we use LightGCN [ 13] as the encoder.
It employs Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn high-order
 
188Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast for Mitigating Popularity Bias KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
collaborative signals [ 8,34], mapping user/item IDs to the user rep-
resentation matrix Z∈R𝑀×𝐷and the item representation matrix
H∈R𝑁×𝐷. Next, the prediction score estimates how likely user 𝑢
will prefer item 𝑖based on these representations. We use the dot
product [ 10,24] to define the prediction score: 𝑠(𝑢,𝑖)=z𝑇𝑢h𝑖, where
𝑠(𝑢,𝑖)denotes the prediction score for user 𝑢on item𝑖, and z𝑢and
h𝑖denote the representations of user 𝑢and item𝑖, respectively.
To better optimize the learning of representations, many studies
use the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss [ 24], a well-
designed pairwise ranking objective for the recommendation. We
apply this as the main loss for the recommendation task:
L𝑟𝑒𝑐=−1
|R|∑︁
(𝑢,𝑖,𝑗)∈O+𝑙𝑛𝜎(𝑠(𝑢,𝑖)−𝑠(𝑢,𝑗)), (1)
where𝜎(·)is the sigmoid function, O+={(𝑢,𝑖,𝑗)|R𝑢,𝑖=1,R𝑢,𝑗=
0}represents pairwise data, and 𝑗is a randomly sampled negative
item that the user has not interacted with.
2.2 Contrastive Learning based CF
Recent studies on Contrastive Learning (CL)-based recommender
systems suggest that optimizing the uniformity of items can mit-
igate popularity bias to some extent [ 15,17,20,49]. Specifically,
CL-based models use Information Normalized Cross Entropy (In-
foNCE [ 22]) to minimize the distance between positive samples and
maximize the distance from negative samples:
L𝑐𝑙=∑︁
𝑖∈𝐼log𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑖/𝜏)
Í
𝑗∈𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑗/𝜏), (2)
where𝑖and𝑗represent positive and negative items respectively, ℎ′
andℎ′′are the item representations after different data augmenta-
tions, and𝜏>0is the temperature coefficient. In this work, we use
noise perturbation for data augmentation, a simpler and more effec-
tive method than graph augmentation [ 46,50]. Although effective,
CL-based methods tend to exacerbate representation separation by
increasing the distance between positive and negative samples, as
illustrated in Section 1.
3 THE PROPOSED MODEL
To address the existing challenges in mitigating popularity bias, we
propose Popularity- Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC), as illus-
trated in Figure. 2. We leverage the common supervisory signals
in popular item representations to guide the learning of unpop-
ular representations and propose a popularity-aware supervised
alignment module. Additionally, we introduce a re-weighting mech-
anism in the contrastive learning module to address representation
separation from a popularity-centric perspective.
3.1 Supervised Alignment Module
During training, the alignment of representations typically empha-
sizes users and items that have interacted [ 24,30], often resulting
in items being closer to interacted users than non-interacted ones
in the representation space. However, due to the limited interac-
tions of unpopular items, they tend to be modeled based on a small
subset of users. This narrow focus might lead to overfitting, as the
representations of unpopular items may not adequately capturetheir characteristics. As illustrated in Section 1, how to enhance
unpopular representation modeling remains a challenge.
The difference in the number of supervisory signals is crucial
in learning representations for popular and unpopular items. In
particular, popular items benefit from an abundance of supervi-
sory signals throughout the alignment process, facilitating effective
learning of their representations. In contrast, unpopular items with
a limited number of supervised users are more prone to overfitting.
This is due to insufficient representation learning for unpopular
items, highlighting the impact of supervisory signal distribution
on representation quality. Intuitively, items interacted with by the
same user share some similar characteristics. In this part, we lever-
age common supervisory signals in popular item representations
and introduce a popularity-aware supervised alignment method to
enhance unpopular item representations.
Specifically, we first filter items with similar characteristics based
on the user’s interests. For any user 𝑢, we refer to the set of items
they interact with as 𝐼𝑢:
𝑰𝑢={𝑖|𝑖∈𝑰𝑎𝑛𝑑R𝑢,𝑖=1|𝑢}. (3)
Consistent with prior work [ 51,58], we count the frequency 𝑝(𝑖)
of each item 𝑖appearing in the training dataset as its popularity.
Afterward, we group 𝐼𝑢based on the relative popularity of the items
𝑝(𝑖). For a clearer explanation, we divide 𝑰𝑢into two groups: the
popular item group 𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢and the unpopular item group 𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢 :
𝑰𝑢=𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢∪𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢,
∀𝑖∈𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖′∈𝐼𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢, 𝑝(𝑖)>𝑝(𝑖′),(4)
where 𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢and𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢 are disjoint, and the popularity of each
item in the popular group is greater than that of any item in the
unpopular group [ 21]. This means that popular items receive more
supervisory information than unpopular items, leading to poorer
recommendation performance for unpopular items.
To address the challenge of inadequate representation learning
for unpopular items, we leverage the assumption that items inter-
acted with by the same user exhibit some similar characteristics.
Specifically, we use similar supervisory signals in popular item
representations to enhance the representations of unpopular items.
Inspired by previous works [ 31,52], we align the representations of
items in 𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢and𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢 to provide more supervisory information
to unpopular items and enhance its representation, as follows:
L𝑠𝑎=∑︁
𝑢∈U1
|𝑰𝑢|∑︁
𝑖∈𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢,𝑖′∈𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑢∥𝑓(𝑖)−𝑓(𝑖′)∥2, (5)
where𝑓(·)is a recommendation encoder and h𝑖=𝑓(𝑖). By effi-
ciently using the inherent information in the data, we provide more
supervisory signals for unpopular items without introducing addi-
tional side information. This module enhances the representation
of unpopular items, mitigating the overfitting issue.
3.2 Re-weighting Contrast Module
Recent studies have highlighted that popularity bias often results
in a distinct representation separation of item embeddings [ 50,54].
While CL-based methods aim to enhance overall uniformity by
pushing negative samples, their current sampling strategies may

inadvertently worsen this separation. When negative samples fol-
low the popularity distribution [ 4,50], dominated by popular items,
optimizing for unpopular items as positive samples enlarges the
gap between popular and unpopular items in the representation
space. Conversely, when negative samples follow a uniform dis-
tribution [49], focusing on popular items separates them from the
majority of unpopular ones, worsening the representation gap. Ex-
isting studies [ 40,50] use the same weights for positive and negative
samples in the contrastive loss function, without considering differ-
ences in item popularity. However, in real-world recommendation
datasets, the impact of items varies due to dataset characteristics
and interaction distributions. Neglecting this aspect could lead to
suboptimal results and exacerbate representation separation.
Inspired by previous works [ 23,58], we propose to identify dif-
ferent influences by re-weighting different popularity items. To this
end, we introduce re-weighting different positive and negative sam-
ples to mitigate representation separation from a popularity-centric
perspective. We incorporate this approach into contrastive learning
to better optimize the consistency of representations. Specifically,
we aim to reduce the risk of pushing items with varying popularity
further apart. For example, when using a popular item as a positive
sample, our goal is to avoid pushing unpopular items too far away.
Thus, we introduce two hyperparameters to control the weights
when items are considered positive and negative samples.
To ensure balanced and equitable representations of items within
our model, we first propose a dynamic strategy to categorize items
into popular and unpopular groups for each mini-batch. Instead
of relying on a fixed global threshold, which often leads to the
overrepresentation of popular items across various batches, we
implement a hyperparameter 𝑥. This hyperparameter readjusts the
classification of items within the current batch. By adjusting thehyperparameter 𝑥, we maintain a balance between different item
popularity levels. This enhances the model’s ability to generalize
across diverse item sets by accurately reflecting the popularity
distribution in the current training context. Specifically, we denote
the set of items within each batch as 𝑰𝐵. And then we divide 𝑰𝐵
into a popular group 𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝and an unpopular group 𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝based
on their respective popularity levels, classifying the top 𝑥%of items
as𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝:
𝑰𝐵=𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝∪𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝,
∀𝑖∈𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖′∈𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝, 𝑝(𝑖)>𝑝(𝑖′),(6)
where 𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝∈𝑰𝐵and𝑰𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝∈𝑰𝐵are disjoint, with 𝑰𝑝𝑜𝑝consisting
of the top𝑥%of items in the batch. In this work, we dynamically
divided items into popular and unpopular groups within each mini-
batch based on their popularity, assigning the top 50% as popular
items and the bottom 50% as unpopular items. This radio not only
ensures equal representation of both groups in our contrastive
learning but also allows items to be classified adaptively based on
the batch’s current composition.
After that, we use InfoNCE [ 22] to optimize the uniformity of
item representations [ 31]. Unlike traditional CL-based methods,
we calculate the loss for different item groups. Specifically, we
introduce the hyperparameter 𝛾to control the positive sample
weights between popular and unpopular items, adapting to varying
item distributions in different datasets:
L𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚
𝑐𝑙=𝛾∗L𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙+(1−𝛾)∗L𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙, (7)
whereL𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙represents the contrastive loss when popular items
are considered as positive samples, and L𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙represents the
contrastive loss when unpopular items are considered as positive
 
190Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast for Mitigating Popularity Bias KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
samples. The value of 𝛾ranges from 0 to 1, where 𝛾=0means exclu-
sive emphasis on the loss of popular items L𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙, and𝛾=1means
exclusive emphasis on the loss of unpopular items L𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙. By ad-
justing𝛾, we can effectively balance the impact of positive samples
from both popular and unpopular items, allowing adaptability to
varying item distributions in different datasets.
Following this, we fine-tune the weighting of negative samples
in the contrastive learning framework using the hyperparameter
𝛽. This parameter controls how samples from different popularity
groups contribute as negative samples. Specifically, we prioritize
re-weighting items with popularity opposite to the positive sam-
ples, mitigating the risk of excessively pushing negative samples
away and reducing representation separation. Simultaneously, this
approach ensures the optimization of intra-group consistency. For
instance, when dealing with popular items as positive samples, we
separately calculate the impact of popular and unpopular items
as negative samples. The hyperparameter 𝛽is then used to con-
trol the degree to which unpopular items are pushed away. This is
formalized as follows:
L𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙=∑︁
𝑖∈𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑝log𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑖/𝜏)Í
𝑗∈𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑗/𝜏)+𝛽Í
𝑗∈𝐼𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑗/𝜏),(8)
similarly, the contrastive loss for unpopular items is defined as:
L𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙=∑︁
𝑖∈𝐼𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝log𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑖/𝜏)Í
𝑗∈𝐼𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑗/𝜏)+𝛽Í
𝑗∈𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ′
𝑖ℎ′′
𝑗/𝜏),
(9)
where the parameter 𝛽ranges from 0 to 1, controlling the negative
sample weighting in the contrastive loss. When 𝛽=0, it means
that only intra-group uniformity optimization is performed. Con-
versely, when 𝛽=1, it means equal treatment of both popular
and unpopular items in terms of their impact on positive samples.
The setting of 𝛽allows for a flexible adjustment between prioritiz-
ing intra-group uniformity and considering the impact of different
popularity levels in the training. We prefer to push away items
within the same group to optimize uniformity. This setup helps
prevent over-optimizing the uniformity of different groups, thereby
mitigating representation separation.
The final re-weighting contrastive objective is the weighted sum
of the user objective and the item objective:
L𝑐𝑙=1
2×(L𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚
𝑐𝑙+L𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟
𝑐𝑙). (10)
In this way, we not only achieved consistency in representation but
also reduced the risk of further separating items with similar char-
acteristics into different representation spaces, thereby alleviating
the issue of representation separation caused by popularity bias.
3.3 Model Optimization
To alleviate popularity bias in collaborative filtering tasks, we utilize
a multi-task training strategy [ 40] to jointly optimize the classic
recommendation loss ( 𝑐𝑓.Equation (1)), supervised alignment loss
(𝑐𝑓.Equation (5)), and re-weighting contrast loss ( 𝑐𝑓.Equation (10)).

4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of PAAC through
extensive experiments, aiming to answer the following questions:
•RQ1: How does PAAC compare to existing debiasing methods?
•RQ2: How do different designed components play roles in our
proposed PAAC ?
•RQ3: How does PAAC alleviate the popularity bias?
•RQ4: How do different hyper-parameters affect the PAAC rec-
ommendation performance?
4.1 Experiments Settings
4.1.1 Datasets. In our experiments, we use three widely public
datasets: Amazon-book2, Yelp20183, and Gowalla4. We retained
users and items with a minimum of 10 interactions, consistent with
previous works [ 5,38,50]. A detailed description can be found in
Appendix A.1.
Note that the traditional dataset splitting methods fail to assess
the effectiveness in mitigating popularity bias because the test sets
still follow the long-tail distribution [ 38,53]. In such cases, the
model might perform well during testing even if it heavily relies
on popularity for recommendations [ 6]. Hence, the conventional
dataset splitting is not appropriate for evaluating whether the model
suffers from popularity bias [ 38]. To this end, we follow previous

works to extract an unbiased dataset where the item distribution in
the test set follows a uniform distribution [ 38,51,54]. Specifically,
we retain a fixed number of interactions for each item in the test set,
amounting to approximately 10% of the entire dataset. Additionally,
to avoid exposing the test distribution, we randomly selected 10% of
interactions from the dataset as the validation set, and the remaining
as the training set.
4.1.2 Baselines and Evaluation Metrics. We implement the
state-of-the-art LightGCN [ 13] to instantiate PAAC, aiming to in-
vestigate how it alleviates popularity bias. We compare PAAC with
several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models
such as IPS [ 58] and𝛾-AdjNorm [ 55], decorrelation-based models
like MACR [ 38] and InvCF [ 51], and contrastive learning-based
models including Adap- 𝜏[7] and SimGCL [ 50]. For detailed descrip-
tions of these models, please refer to Appendix A.2.
We utilize three widely used metrics, namely 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @𝐾,𝐻𝑅@𝐾,
and𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @𝐾, to evaluate the performance of Top- 𝐾recommen-
dation.𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @𝐾and𝐻𝑅@𝐾assess the number of target items
retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. In
contrast,𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @𝐾evaluates the positions of target items in the
ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. Note that we
use the full ranking strategy [ 56], considering all non-interacted
items as candidate items to avoid selection bias during the test
stage [ 46]. We repeated each experiment five times with different
random seeds and reported the average scores.
4.1.3 Hyper-Parameter Settings. Due to the limited space, more
experimental setting details can be found in Appendix A.3.
4.2 Overall Performance (RQ1)
As shown in Table. 1, we compare our model with several base-
lines across three datasets. The best performance for each metric is
highlighted in bold, while the second best is underlined. Our model
consistently outperforms all compared methods across all metrics
in every dataset.
•Our proposed model PAAC consistently outperforms all base-
lines and significantly mitigates the popularity bias. Specifi-
cally, PAAC enhances LightGCN, achieving improvements of
282.65%, 180.79%, and 82.89% in 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20 on the Yelp2018,
Gowalla, and Amazon-Book datasets, respectively. Compared
to the strongest baselines (SimGCL or Adap- 𝜏),PAAC delivers
better performance. The most significant improvements are
observed on Yelp2018, where our model achieves an 8.70% in-
crease in𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @20, a 10.81% increase in 𝐻𝑅@20, and a 30.2%
increase in𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20. This improvement can be attributed to
our use of popularity-aware supervised alignment to enhance
the representation of less popular items and re-weighted con-
trastive learning to address representation separation from a
popularity-centric perspective.
•The performance improvements of PAAC are smaller on sparser
datasets. For example, on the Gowalla dataset, the improve-
ments in𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @20,𝐻𝑅@20, and𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20 are 3.18%, 5.85%,
and 5.47%, respectively. This may be because, in sparser datasets
like Gowalla, even popular items are not well-represented due
to lower data density. Aligning unpopular items with these
poorly represented popular items can introduce noise into themodel. Therefore, the benefits of using supervisory signals for
unpopular items may be reduced in very sparse environments,
leading to smaller performance improvements.
•Regarding the baselines for mitigating popularity bias, the im-
provement of 𝛾-Adjnorm is relatively limited compared to the
backbone model (LightGCN) and even performs worse in some
cases. This may be because 𝛾-Adjnorm is specifically designed
for traditional data-splitting scenarios, where the test set still
follows a long-tail distribution, leading to poor generalization.
IPS and MACR mitigate popularity bias by excluding item pop-
ularity information. InvCF uses invariant learning to remove
popularity information at the representation level, generally
performing better than IPS and MACR. This shows the impor-
tance of addressing popularity bias at the representation level.
Adap-𝜏and SimGCL outperform the other baselines, emphasiz-
ing the necessary to improve item representation consistency
for mitigating popularity bias.
•Different metrics across various datasets show varying im-
provements in model performance. Adapt- 𝜏performs well on
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @20 and𝐻𝑅@20, while SimGCL excels in 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20.
This suggests that different debiasing methods may need dis-
tinct optimization strategies for models. Additionally, we ob-
serve varying effects of PAAC across different datasets, with
performance improvements of 9.76%, 7.35%, and 4.83% on the
Yelp2018, Amazon-Book, and Gowalla datasets, respectively.
This difference could be due to the sparser nature of the Gowalla
dataset. Conversely, our model can directly provide supervisory
signals for unpopular items and conduct intra-group optimiza-
tion, consistently maintaining optimal performance across all
metrics on the three datasets.
4.3 Ablation Study (RQ2)
To better understand the effectiveness of each component in PAAC,
we conduct ablation studies on three datasets. Table. 2 presents a
comparison between PAAC and its variants on recommendation
performance. Specifically, PAAC -w/o𝑃refers to the variant where
the re-weighting contrastive loss of popular items is removed, fo-
cusing instead on optimizing the consistency of representations for
unpopular items. Similarly, PAAC -w/o𝑈denotes the removal of
the re-weighting contrastive loss for unpopular items. PAAC -w/o𝐴
refers to the variant without the popularity-aware supervised align-
ment loss. It’s worth noting that PAAC -w/o𝐴differs from SimGCL
in that we split the contrastive loss on the item side, L𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚
𝑐𝑙, into
two distinct losses: L𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙andL𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑝
𝑐𝑙. This approach allows us to
separately address the consistency of popular and unpopular item
representations, thereby providing a more detailed analysis of the
impact of each component on the overall performance.
From Table. 2, we observe that PAAC -w/o𝐴outperforms SimGCL
in most cases. This validates that re-weighting the importance of
popular and unpopular items can effectively improve the model’s
performance in alleviating popularity bias. It also demonstrates the
effectiveness of using supervision signals from popular items to
enhance the representations of unpopular items, providing more op-
portunities for future research on mitigating popularity bias. More-
over, compared with PAAC -w/o𝑈,PAAC -w/o𝑃results in much
worse performance. This confirms the importance of re-weighting

popular items in contrastive learning for mitigating popularity bias.
Finally, PAAC consistently outperforms the three variants, demon-
strating the effectiveness of combining supervised alignment and
re-weighting contrastive learning. Based on the above analysis, we
conclude that leveraging supervisory signals from popular item
representations can better optimize representations for unpopu-
lar items, and re-weighting contrastive learning allows the model
to focus on more informative or critical samples, thereby improv-
ing overall performance. All the proposed modules significantly
contribute to alleviating popularity bias.
4.4 Debias Ability (RQ3)
To further verify the effectiveness of PAAC in alleviating popularity
bias, we conduct a comprehensive analysis focusing on the recom-
mendation performance across different popularity item groups.
Specifically, 20% of the most popular items are labeled ‘Popular’,
and the rest are labeled ‘Unpopular’. As shown in Figure. 3, we
compare the performance of PAAC with LightGCN, IPS, MACR,
and SimGCL using the 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20 metric across different popular-
ity groups. We use Δto denote the accuracy gap between the two
groups. From Figure. 3, we draw the following conclusions:
•Our proposed PAAC significantly enhances the recommenda-
tion performance for unpopular items. Specifically, we observe
an improvement of 8.94% and 7.30% in 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20 relative to
SimGCL on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.
This improvement is due to the popularity-aware supervisedalignment method, which uses supervisory signals from popu-
lar items to improve the representations of unpopular items.
•PAAC has successfully narrowed the accuracy gap between dif-
ferent item groups. Specifically, PAAC achieved the smallest gap,
reducing the 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20 accuracy gap by 34.18% and 87.50% on
the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively. This indicates
that our method treats items from different groups fairly, ef-
fectively alleviating the impact of popularity bias. This success
can be attributed to our re-weighted contrast module, which
addresses representation separation from a popularity-centric
perspective, resulting in more consistent recommendation re-
sults across different groups.
•Improving the performance of unpopular items is crucial for en-
hancing overall model performance. Specially, on the Yelp2018
dataset, PAAC shows reduced accuracy in recommending pop-
ular items, with a notable decrease of 20.14% compared to
SimGCL. However, despite this decrease, the overall recommen-
dation accuracy surpasses that of SimGCL by 11.94%, primarily
due to a 6.81% improvement in recommending unpopular items.
This improvement highlights the importance of better recom-
mendations for unpopular items and emphasizes their crucial
role in enhancing overall model performance.
Due to space limitations, we demonstrate the debiasing capabili-
ties of our model from more dimensions in Appendix A.4, such as
conventional test sets and representation separation analysis.

4.5 Hyperparameter Sensitivities (RQ4)
In this section, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters in PAAC.
Firstly, we investigate the influence of 𝜆1and𝜆2, which respectively
control the impact of the popularity-aware supervised alignment
and re-weighting contrast loss. Additionally, in the re-weighting
contrastive loss, we introduce two hyperparameters, 𝛾and𝛽, to
control the re-weighting of different popularity items as positive
and negative samples. Finally, we explore the impact of the grouping
ratio𝑥on the model’s performance.
4.5.1 Effect of𝜆1and𝜆2.As formulated in Eq. (11), 𝜆1controls
the extent of providing additional supervisory signals for unpopular
items, while 𝜆2controls the extent of optimizing representation
consistency. Figure. 4 illustrates how the relative performance to
the best baseline 𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @20 varies with𝜆1and𝜆2on the Yelp2018
and Gowalla datasets. Horizontally, with the increase in 𝜆2, the
performance initially increases and then decreases. This indicates
that appropriate re-weighting contrastive loss effectively enhances
the consistency of representation distributions, mitigating popular-
ity bias. However, overly strong contrastive loss may lead the model
to neglect recommendation accuracy. Vertically, as 𝜆1increases,
the performance also initially increases and then decreases. This
suggests that suitable alignment can provide beneficial supervisory
signals for unpopular items, while too strong an alignment may in-
troduce more noise from popular items to unpopular ones, thereby
impacting recommendation performance.
4.5.2 Effect of re-weighting coefficient 𝛾and𝛽.To mitigate
representation separation due to imbalanced positive and negative
sampling, we introduce two hyperparameters into the contrastive
loss. Specifically, 𝛾controls the weight difference between positive

samples from popular and unpopular items, while 𝛽controls the
influence of different popularity items as negative samples.
In our experiments, while keeping other hyperparameters con-
stant, we search 𝛾and𝛽within the range {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1}.
Figure. 5 illustrates how performance changes when varying 𝛾
and𝛽on two datasets, with horizontal lines representing the best
baseline. As 𝛾and𝛽increase, performance initially improves and
then declines. The optimal hyperparameters for the Yelp2018 and
Gowalla datasets are 𝛾=0.8,𝛽=0.6and𝛾=0.2,𝛽=0.2, respec-
tively. This may be attributed to the characteristics of the datasets.
The Yelp2018 dataset, with a higher average interaction frequency
per item, benefits more from a higher weight 𝛾for popular items as
positive samples. Conversely, the Gowalla dataset, being relatively
sparse, prefers a smaller 𝛾. This indicates the importance of consid-
ering dataset characteristics when adjusting the contributions of
popular and unpopular items to the model.
Notably,𝛾and𝛽are not highly sensitive within the range [0,1],
performing well across a broad spectrum. Figure. 5 shows that
performance exceeds the baseline regardless of 𝛽values when other
parameters are optimal. Additionally, 𝛾values from[0.4,1.0]on
the Yelp2018 dataset and [0.2,0.8]on the Gowalla dataset surpass
the baseline, indicating less need for precise tuning. Thus, 𝛾and
𝛽achieve optimal performance without meticulous adjustments,
focusing on weight coefficients to maintain model efficacy.
4.5.3 Effect of grouping ratio 𝑥.To investigate the impact of
different grouping ratios on recommendation performance, we de-
veloped a flexible classification method for items within each mini-
batch based on their popularity. Instead of adopting a fixed global
 
194Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast for Mitigating Popularity Bias KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
threshold, which tends to overrepresent popular items in some
mini-batches, our approach dynamically divides items in each mini-
batch into popular and unpopular categories. Specifically, the top
𝑥%of items are classified as popular and the remaining (100−𝑥)%
as unpopular, with 𝑥varying. This strategy prevents the overrepre-
sentation typical in fixed distribution models, which could skew the
learning process and degrade performance. To quantify the effects
of these varying ratios, we examined various division ratios for pop-
ular items, including 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, as shown in Table. 3.
The preliminary results indicate that both extremely low and high
ratios negatively affect model performance, thereby underscoring
the superiority of our dynamic data partitioning approach. More-
over, within the 40%-60% range, our model’s performance remained
consistently robust, further validating the effectiveness of PAAC.
5 RELATED WORK
5.1 Popularity Bias in Recommendation
Popularity bias is a common issue in recommender systems where
unpopular items in the training dataset are rarely recommended [ 32,
38]. Many methods [ 2,6,35–37] have been proposed to analyze and
reduce performance differences between popular and unpopular
items. These methods can be broadly categorized into three types.
•Re-weighting-based methods aim to increase the training
weight or scores for unpopular items, redirecting focus away from
popular items during training or prediction [ 5,55,58]. For instance,
IPS [ 58] adds compensation to unpopular items and adjusts the
prediction of the user-item preference matrix, resulting in higher
preference scores and improving rankings for unpopular items. 𝛾-
AdjNorm [ 55] enhances the focus on unpopular items by controlling
the normalization strength during the neighborhood aggregation
process in GCN-based models.
•Decorrelation-based methods aim to effectively remove the
correlations between item representations (or prediction scores)
and popularity[ 1,26,33,38,41,53]. For instance, MACR [ 38] uses
counterfactual reasoning to eliminate the direct impact of popu-
larity on item outcomes. In contrast, InvCF [ 51] operates on the
principle that item representations remain invariant to changes in
popularity semantics, filtering out unstable or outdated popularity
characteristics to learn unbiased representations.
•Contrastive-learning-based methods aim to achieve overall
uniformity in item representations using InfoNCE [ 15,44], pre-
serving more inherent characteristics of items to mitigate pop-
ularity bias [ 31,50]. This approach has been demonstrated as a
state-of-the-art method for alleviating popularity bias. It employs
data augmentation techniques such as graph augmentation or fea-
ture augmentation to generate different views, maximizing positive
pair consistency and minimizing negative pair consistency to pro-
mote more uniform representations [ 49]. Specifically, Adap- 𝜏[7]
adjusts user/item embeddings to specific values, while SimGCL[ 50]
integrates InfoNCE loss to enhance representation uniformity and
alleviate popularity bias.
5.2 Representation Learning for CF
Representation learning is crucial in recommendation systems, es-
pecially in modern collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. It creates
personalized embeddings that capture user preferences and itemcharacteristics [ 15,24,39,42,47]. The quality of these representa-
tions critically determines a recommender system’s effectiveness
by precisely capturing the interplay between user interests and
item features [ 14,30,50]. Recent studies emphasize two funda-
mental principles in representation learning: alignment and uni-
formity [ 28,30,31]. The alignment principle ensures that embed-
dings of similar or related items (or users) are closely clustered
together, improving the system’s ability to recommend items that
align with a user’s interests [ 31]. This principle is crucial when
accurately reflecting user preferences through corresponding item
characteristics [ 30]. Conversely, the uniformity principle ensures a
balanced distribution of all embeddings across the representation
space [ 40,50]. This approach prevents the over-concentration of
embeddings in specific areas, enhancing recommendation diversity
and improving generalization to unseen data [50].
In this work, we focus on aligning the representations of pop-
ular and unpopular items interacted with by the same user and
re-weighting uniformity to mitigate representation separation. Our
model PAAC uniquely addresses popularity bias by combining
group alignment and contrastive learning, a first in the field. Unlike
previous works that align positive user-item pairs or contrastive
pairs, PAAC directly aligns popular and unpopular items, leveraging
the rich information of popular items to enhance the representa-
tions of unpopular items and reduce overfitting. Additionally, we
introduce targeted re-weighting from a popularity-centric perspec-
tive to achieve a more balanced representation.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we analyzed popularity bias and proposed PAAC to
mitigate popularity bias. We assumed that items interacted with
by the same user share similar characteristics and used this ob-
servation to align representations of both popular and unpopular
items through a popularity-aware supervised alignment approach.
This provided more supervisory information for unpopular items.
Note that our hypothesis of aligning and grouping items based
on user-specific preferences offers a novel alignment perspective.
Additionally, we addressed the issue of representation separation
in current CL-based models by introducing two hyper-parameters
to control the weights of items with different popularity levels
as positive and negative samples. This approach optimized rep-
resentation consistency and effectively alleviated separation. Our
method, PAAC, was validated on three public datasets, proving its
rationale and effectiveness.
In the future, we will explore deeper alignment and contrast
adjustments tailored to specific tasks to further mitigate popular-
ity bias. We aim to investigate the synergies between alignment
and contrast and extend our approach to address other biases in
recommendation systems.

A APPENDIX
A.1 Datasets
We conducted experiments on three public datasets, with the pro-
cessed dataset statistics summarized in Table. 4. Additionally, to
analyze the imbalance in item distribution, we recorded the number
of interactions for the most and least popular items and calculated
the average number of interactions per item. We also used the
Gini coefficient to reflect the disparity in item popularity distribu-
tion [23]. The results are presented in Table. 5.
Amazon-Book. Amazon is a frequently utilized dataset for item
recommendations. From this collection, we specifically selected the
Amazon-Book dataset.
Yelp2018. This dataset is sourced from the 2018 edition of the
Yelp Challenge, where local businesses such as restaurants and bars
are considered items.
Gowalla. This is a check-in dataset from Gowalla, that contains
user location data shared through check-ins.

A.2 Baselines
We compare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-
weighting-based models such as IPS and 𝛾-AdjNorm, decorrelation-
based models like MACR and InvCF, and contrastive learning-based
models including Adap- 𝜏and SimGCL.
•BPRMF [ 24]is a traditional CF-based model that maps user
and item IDs into a representation space via matrix factorization.
It optimizes using Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss;
•LightGCN [ 13]is a state-of-the-art CF-based model that effec-
tively captures high-order collaborative signals between users
and items by linearly propagating embeddings on the user-item
interaction graph through multiple layers;•IPS [ 58]adjusts the weight of each user-item interaction ac-
cording to item popularity, aiming to mitigate popularity bias;
•MACR [ 38]estimates and eliminates the direct influence of
item popularity on prediction scores, using counterfactual in-
ference to mitigate popularity bias;
•𝛾-AdjNorm [55] modifies the hyper-parameter 𝛾to preferen-
tially treat unpopular items in graph aggregation, resulting in
non-symmetric aggregation;
•InvCF [ 51]learns unbiased preference representations that
remain stable regardless of item popularity, simultaneously
removing unstable and outdated characteristics;
•Adap-𝜏[7]dynamically standardizes user and item embed-
dings to specific values to reduce popularity bias;
•SimGCL [ 50]aims to achieve a more uniform distribution of
representations by incorporating the InfoNCE loss, which helps
in mitigating popularity bias.
A.3 Hyper-Parameter Settings
We initialize parameters using the Xavier initializer [ 12] and use the
Adam optimizer [ 18] with a learning rate of 0.001. The embedding
size is fixed at 64. For all datasets, we set the batch size is 2048, and
the𝐿2regularization coefficient 𝜆3is 0.0001. For our model, we fine-
tune the popularity-aware supervised alignment coefficient 𝜆1in {1,
5, 10, 50, 100, 300, 400, 500, 100}, the popularity-aware contrastive
regularization coefficient 𝜆2in {0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20}, and the re-weighting
hyperparameters 𝛾and𝛽in {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}. Additionally,
we set the grouping ratio x=50. This means we dynamically divided
items into popular and unpopular groups within each mini-batch
based on their popularity, assigning the top 50% as popular items
and the bottom 50% as unpopular items. This approach ensures
equal representation of both groups in our contrastive learning and
allows items to be adaptively classified based on the batch’s current
composition. Moreover, we carefully search the hyper-parameters
for all baselines to ensure fair comparisons.
A.4 Debias Ability
A.4.1 Conventional Test. As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, tradi-
tional evaluation methods fail to accurately measure a model’s
ability to mitigate popularity bias, as test sets often exhibit a long-
tail distribution. This can misleadingly suggest high performance
for models that favor popular items. To address this significant issue,
we utilize an unbiased dataset for evaluation, ensuring a uniform
item distribution in the test set, following established precedents.
Despite this, traditional performance metrics remain essential for
effectively assessing model performance. Therefore, we also exam-
inePAAC ’s results under conventional experimental settings. These
results, detailed in Table. 6, demonstrate that our method competes
closely with the best baselines, affirming its efficacy under standard
evaluation conditions.
A.4.2 Impact on Embedding Separation. To evaluate the im-
pact of PAAC on embedding separation, we conduct detailed quan-
titative and qualitative analyses from various perspectives.
Quantitative Analysis. Following the Pareto principle [ 43],
items are categorized into ’Popular’ and ’Unpopular’ groups. To
quantify the differences in the distribution of embeddings between

embeddings from our dataset.
these groups, we employed two key metrics: Maximum Mean Dis-
crepancy (MMD) and Cosine Similarity (CS). MMD measures the
statistical distance between two distributions and is defined as:
MMD2(𝑋,𝑌)=1
𝑚𝑚∑︁
𝑖=1𝜙(𝑥𝑖)−1
𝑛𝑛∑︁
𝑗=1𝜙(𝑦𝑗)2
,
where𝑋and𝑌represent samples from the two distributions, with
𝑚and𝑛as their respective sample sizes, and 𝜙denotes a feature
map into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Conversely, Cosine
Similarity (CS) evaluates the angular difference between vectors,
reflecting the diversity in their representations:
CS(𝑥1,𝑥2)=𝑥1·𝑥2
∥𝑥1∥∥𝑥2∥,
where𝑥1and𝑥2are the embedding vectors. Table. 7 shows the re-
sults for MMD and CS, demonstrating that PAAC significantly low-
ers the disparity between the distributions of popular and unpopular
items—as evidenced by reduced values in both metrics—thereby
effectively enhancing embedding separation.Qualitative Analysis . The effectiveness of PAAC is further vali-
dated through a comprehensive visual assessment using t-SNE [ 29],
a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction and visu-
alization. This analysis involved visualizing the embeddings of a
randomly selected subset of 400 items from the dataset. By plotting
these embeddings, we are able to visually compare the performance
ofPAAC against a baseline model, LightGCN.
Figure 6 provides a clear illustration of this comparison. The
figure demonstrates that PAAC achieves a significantly more uni-
form distribution of embeddings compared to LightGCN. In partic-
ular, both popular and unpopular items are more evenly dispersed
throughout the embedding space under PAAC, rather than clus-
tering in separate regions. This uniform distribution is indicative
of reduced embedding separation, a crucial factor in mitigating
popularity bias. The visual assessment, therefore, provides strong
qualitative evidence that complements our statistical analyses, re-
inforcing the overall robustness and efficacy of PAAC in promoting
fairer and more balanced representation of items in the embedding
space.
