ABSTRACT
We present Tencent’s ads recommendation system and examine the
challenges and practices of learning appropriate recommendation
representations. Our study begins by showcasing our approaches
to preserving prior knowledge when encoding features of diverse
types into embedding representations. We specifically address se-
quence features, numeric features, and pre-trained embedding fea-
tures. Subsequently, we delve into two crucial challenges related to
feature representation: the dimensional collapse of embeddings and
theinterest entanglement across different tasks or scenarios. We pro-
pose several practical approaches to address these challenges that
result in robust and disentangled recommendation representations.
We then explore several training techniques to facilitate model
optimization, reduce bias, and enhance exploration. Additionally,
we introduce three analysis tools that enable us to study feature
correlation, dimensional collapse, and interest entanglement. This
work builds upon the continuous efforts of Tencent’s ads recom-
mendation team over the past decade. It summarizes general design
principles and presents a series of readily applicable solutions and
analysis tools. The reported performance is based on our online ad-
vertising platform, which handles hundreds of billions of requests
daily and serves millions of ads to billions of users.

1 INTRODUCTION
The online advertising industry, valued at billions of dollars, is
a remarkable example of the successful application of machine
learning. Various advertising formats, including sponsored search
advertising, contextual advertising, display advertising, and micro-
video advertising, heavily rely on the accurate, efficient, and reliable
prediction of ads click-through or conversion rates using learned
models.
Over the past decade, deep learning has achieved remarkable
success in diverse domains, including computer vision (CV) [ 23,34],
natural language processing (NLP) [ 1,16,62], and recommendation
systems [ 41,77]. The effectiveness of deep learning critically de-
pends on the selection of appropriate data representations [ 3,67,68].
Researchers have extensively explored various aspects of represen-
tation learning in CV and NLP. These investigations have focused
on topics such as priors [ 62], smoothness and the curse of dimen-
sionality [ 5], depth and abstraction [ 4], disentangling factors of
variations [68], and the uniformity of representations [28, 30].
In the field of recommendation systems, numerous works have fo-
cused on representation learning techniques to handle various types
of features [ 9,19,32,79,81], capture feature correlations through
explicit or implicit feature interactions [ 12,20,37,45,51,60,66],

address the entangled interest within users’ complex behaviors [ 69],
particularly in multi-task [ 43,59] or multi-scenario [ 7,54,83] set-
tings, and enhance data representation through self-supervised
learning [ 63,84]. Despite the progress made in these representation-
oriented works, several fundamental questions regarding represen-
tation learning in large-scale real-world ads recommenders remain
unanswered.
•Priors for Representation: Real-world systems encompass var-
ious types of features from diverse sources, including se-
quence features (e.g., user click/conversion history), numeric
features (e.g., semantic-preserving ad IDs), and embedding
features from pre-trained external models (e.g., GNN or LLM).
Preserving the inherent priors of these features when encod-
ing them in recommendation systems is crucial.
•Dimensional Collapse: The encoding process maps all features
into embeddings, typically represented as 𝐾-dimensional
vectors, and are learned during model training. However,
we observe that the embeddings of many fields tend to oc-
cupy a lower-dimensional subspace instead of fully utilizing
the available 𝐾-dimensional space. Such dimensional col-
lapse not only leads to parameter wastage but also limits the
scalability of recommendation models.
•Interest Entanglement: User responses in ads recommender
systems are determined by complex underlying factors, par-
ticularly when multiple tasks or scenarios are learned simul-
taneously. Existing shared-embedding approaches [ 6,43,59]
may fail to disentangle these factors adequately, as they rely
on a single entangled embedding for each feature.This paper presents our practices for addressing these challenges.
The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 provides an overview of our model architecture, giving a
high-level understanding of the system. Section 3 focuses on the en-
coding techniques used to integrate temporal, ordinal, and distance
priors of different feature types into the representation. Section 4
delves into the root causes of the embedding dimensional collapse
and proposes several solutions to mitigate this issue. Section 5 ex-
plores the challenge of interest entanglement across various tasks
and scenarios and our solutions. Section 6 presents various model
training techniques. Finally, Section 7 introduces a set of off-the-
shelf tools designed to facilitate the analysis of feature correlations,
dimensional collapse, and interest entanglement. Due to space lim-
itations, this paper cannot provide a detailed description of each
approach. For more in-depth information, please refer to the corre-
sponding paper cited in each section.
2 BRIEF SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The overall architecture of our ads recommendation model for
single-task learning is illustrated in Fig. 1. For the multi-task learn-
ing model architecture, please refer to Fig. 4. Our model follows the
widely adopted Embedding & Explicit Interaction framework [ 41,
77], which consists of four key modules: feature encoding, multi-
embedding lookup, experts (feature interactions and MLPs), and
classification towers. In the feature encoding module, we apply
specific encoding methods tailored to various feature types in our
system. Next, based on the encoded IDs obtained from the feature
encoding module, multiple embeddings are looked up from individ-
ual embedding tables for each feature. Within the expert module,
5567Ads Recommendation in a Collapsed and Entangled World KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
embeddings from the same table are explicitly interacted with one
another. The outputs of the expert module are then passed through
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with non-linear transformations.
The classification towers receive the gate-weighted sum of the out-
puts from the experts. Finally, the sigmoid activation function is
applied to generate the final prediction.
In the case of single-task learning, such as Click-Through Rate
(CTR) prediction, our model employs a single tower, as depicted in
Fig. 1. However, in the context of multi-task learning (MTL), such as
Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction, where each conversion type is
treated as an individual task [ 48], our model utilizes multiple towers
and corresponding gates. Each tower is dedicated to a specific
group of conversion types, allowing for task-specific predictions.
To address the challenge of interest entanglement that arises in
the MTL setting, further evolution of the model architecture to
disentangle user interest is presented in Section 5.
Our team is responsible for ads recommendation across all mod-
ules, including retrieval and pre-ranking, CTR prediction (pCTR),
(shallow) conversion prediction (pCVR) of various conversion types,
deep conversion prediction (pDCVR), and Long-time Value predic-
tion (pLTV). There are many commonalities regarding the model
design principle among these modules, and we mainly discuss the
pCTR and pCVR as representative modules for single-task and
multi-task learning, respectively. Our models serve various ads rec-
ommendation scenarios within Tencent, encompassing Moments
(social stream), Channels (micro-video stream), Official Accounts
(subscription), Tencent News, Tencent Video (long-video platform),
and Demand Side Platform.
3 FEATURE ENCODING
In industrial ads recommendation systems, features are generated
from many sources and belong to different types, such as sequence,
numeric, and embedding features. When encoding these features,
we’d like to preserve their inherent temporal, ordinal, or distance
(similarity) priors as much as possible.
3.1 Sequence Features
A user’s history behaviors reflect her interest, making them critical
in recommendations. One key characteristic of such features is that
there are strong semantic and temporal correlations between these
behaviors and the target [ 82]. For example, given a target ad, those
behaviors that are either semantically related (e.g., belonging to the
same category with the target ad) or temporally close to the target
are more informative to predict the user’s response to the target
item.
We propose Temporal Interest Module (TIM) [ 82] to learn the
quadruple semantic-temporal correlation between (behavior seman-
tic, target semantic, behavior temporal, target temporal). Specifically,
in addition to the semantic encoding [ 17,80,81], TIM leverages
Target-aware Temporal Encoding for each behavior, e.g., the rel-
ative position ortime interval between each behavior and target.
Furthermore, to capture the quadruple correlation, TIM employs
Target-aware Attention and Target-aware Representation to inter-
act behaviors with the target in both attention and representation,
resulting in explicit 4-way interaction (shown in Fig. 2(a)). Mathemat-
ically, the encoding of user behavior sequence Hcan be formulated
as:𝒖TIM=∑︁
𝑋𝑖∈H𝛼(˜𝒆𝑖,˜𝒗𝑡)·(˜𝒆𝑖⊙˜𝒗𝑡) (1)
where𝛼(˜𝒆𝑖,˜𝒗𝑡)denotes the target-aware attention between each
behavior𝑖and target𝑡,(˜𝒆𝑖⊙˜𝒗𝑡)denotes the target-aware repre-
sentation, and ˜𝒆𝑖=𝒆𝑖⊕𝒑𝑓(𝑋𝑖)denotes the temporally encoded
embedding of the𝑖-th behavior, which is an element-wise summa-
tion of semantic embedding 𝒆𝑖and target-aware temporal encoding
𝒑𝑓(𝑋𝑖),i.e., the embedding of either the relative position of each be-
havior regarding the target, or the discretized time interval. Please
note that the target-aware representation ˜𝒆𝑖⊙˜𝒗𝑡acts like a feature
interaction layer to explicitly interact the behavior feature with
the target, as done in other FM-based explicit feature interaction
models [ 31,37,49,52,66]. The importance of such explicit behavior-
target interaction in the representation was also emphasized in a
recent work [74].
Deployment Details. In practice, we adopt both relative position
and time interval for temporal encoding. The output of TIM is
concatenated with the output of the feature interaction module, e.g.,
DCN V2 [ 66] or GwPFM (will be discussed later). We apply TIM on
the user’s click/conversion category sequence features in various
click and conversion prediction tasks across multiple scenarios.
TIM brings a 1.93%Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) lift in WeChat
pCTR and a 2.45%GMV lift in Game and e-Commerce pLTV. We
observe the model learns much stronger decaying patterns in the time
interval embeddings than the relative position embedding. This is
because users’ clicks on ads are pretty sparse, making time intervals
more informative than relative positions.
3.2 Numeric Features
Unlike independent ID features, there is inherent partial order
between numeric/ordinal features, such as Age_20≺Age_30 . To
preserve these ordinal priors, we adopt a simplified variant of the
NaryDis encoding [ 9], namely the Multiple Numeral Systems Encod-
ing (MNSE). It encodes numeric features by getting codes according
to multiple numeral systems (i.e., binary, ternary, decimal) and then
assigns learnable embeddings to these codes, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
For example, a feature value "51" is transformed into code "{6_1,
5_1, 4_0, 3_0, 2_1, 1_1}" according to binary system, and "{6_0,
5_0, 4_1, 3_2, 2_2, 1_0}" according to ternary system. All codes
are projected to embeddings and then sum-pooled to get the final
encoding result. To improve computation efficiency, we remove
the inter- and intra-attention in the original NaryDis [ 9]. Given a
continuous feature with value 𝑣, the encoding result is:
𝑓MNS(𝑣)=[𝐾2∑︁
𝑘=1X(2)
2𝑘+B𝑘,𝐾3∑︁
𝑘=1X(3)
3𝑘+C𝑘,...,𝐾𝑛∑︁
𝑘=1X(𝑛)
𝑛𝑘+N𝑘]
B=func_binary(𝑣),C=func_ternary(𝑣),...(2)
where X(2)
2𝑘+B𝑘andX(3)
3𝑘+C𝑘are the embedding dictionaries for bi-
nary and ternary systems respectively, whose lengths of encodings
are𝐾2and𝐾3.func_binary andfunc_ternary are the binarization
and ternarization functions that transform the continuous feature
𝑣into their corresponding encodings.

Deployment Details. In an advertising system, ads are often in-
dexed by discrete identifiers (Ad IDs), which are self-incremental
or random and contain little information. However, each ad is asso-
ciated with a creative containing abundant visual semantics. We
replace the self-incremental or random Ad IDs with novel Visual
Semantic IDs to preserve the visual similarity between ads. We
achieve this by obtaining visual embeddings from ad images us-
ing a vision model and applying hashing algorithms like Locality-
Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [ 64] to preserve visual similarity. The
Visual Semantic IDs serve as numeric features, and we apply Min-
imum Norm Scaling (MNS) to preserve their ordinal priors. This
replacement leads to a 1.13% GMV lift in Moments pCVR, with a
larger lift of 1.74% for new ads. Additionally, the coefficient of vari-
ation in prediction scores among similar ads exposed to the same
user is significantly reduced from 2.44% to 0.30%, substantiating
that our approach can preserve the visual similarity priors.
3.3 Embedding Features
Besides the main recommendation model, we may train a separate
model, such as LLM or GNN, to learn embeddings for entities (users
or items). Such embeddings capture the relationship between users
and items from a different perspective, e.g., a Graph Model or a
Self-Supervised Language Model, and can be trained on a larger or
different dataset and hence should provide extra information to the
recommendation models. The key challenge in leveraging such pre-
trained embedding directly in our recommendation system is the
semantic gap between the embedding space of the external models
and the recommenders. That is, these embedding captures different
semantics from the collaborative semantics of the ID embeddings
in recommendation models [36, 79].
We propose a Similarity Encoding Embedding approach to miti-
gate such a semantic gap. Take GNN for example. Once we train a
GNN model and get the pre-trained embeddings ¯𝒆𝑢,¯𝒆𝑖for each user-
item pair(𝑢,𝑖), we first calculate the similarity 𝑤sim(𝑢,𝑖)based on
their GNN embeddings using the corresponding similarity function,
i.e., cosine in GraphSage [22]. Formally,𝑤sim(𝑢,𝑖)=sim(¯𝒆𝑢,¯𝒆𝑖). (3)
Such a similarity score is an ordinal value. Hence, similar to
numeric features, we can use the Multiple Numeral Systems Encod-
ing mentioned before to transform it into a learnable embedding
𝒆sim(𝑢,𝑖)=𝑓MNS(𝑤sim(𝑢,𝑖)). After that, the encoded embedding
is simultaneously co-trained with the other ID embeddings in rec-
ommenders. Thus, the similarity priors in the original space are
retained via the similarity score and encoding. Then, such priors are
transferred to the recommenders by aligning the similarity encod-
ing embedding 𝒆sim(𝑢,𝑖)with the recommendation ID embeddings.
Furthermore, such an embedding encoding strategy has also been
developed to incorporate large-language model (LLM) knowledge
into our recommendation system. An LLM model is first trans-
formed into an encoder-only architecture and trained with base
proxy tasks like next-sentence prediction. Through such general
pre-training, the LLM encoder can encode semantic embedding.
After that, the LLM model is finetuned with high-quality positive
and negative user-item pairs from the ads domain. Such contrastive
alignment enables the LLM to generate high-quality pre-trained
user embeddings ¯𝒆𝑢and ad embeddings ¯𝒆𝑖. With such LLM simi-
larity priors, like GNN embeddings, we can then adopt Similarity
Encoding Embedding for space alignment.
Deployment Details. We train a GraphSage [ 22] upon a user-
ad/content bipartite graph, with clicks in both ad and content rec-
ommendation domains as the edges. We then adopt the Similarity
Encoding Embedding on the GNN embeddings and concatenate
the resulting representation with that of the feature interaction
layer. GNN embeddings are successfully deployed in many scenar-
ios, leading to +1.21%, +0.59%, and 1.47% GMV lift on Moments,
Channel, and Applet pCTR. In addition, incorporating LLM also
leads to +2.55% GMV lift on Channel pCVR and +1.41% GMV lift
on Channel pCTR during online A/B test.

4 TACKLING DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE
After encoding, all features are transformed into embeddings and
then interact with each other explicitly through FM-like mod-
els [20,31,33,37,49,51,52,58,66]. However, one key side effect of
explicit feature interaction is that some dimensions of embeddings
collapse [ 21]. In this section, we’ll first explain the dimensional col-
lapse phenomenon and then present two different multi-embedding
approaches and a collapse-resilient feature interaction function to
mitigate it.
4.1 Embedding Dimensional Collapse
Recent work [ 1,18,78] has demonstrated that large-scale models
especially transformer-based models with billions, even trillions,
of parameters can achieve remarkable performance (e.g., GPT-4 [ 1],
LLaMA [ 61]). Inspired by these works, we explore how to scale
up ads recommendation models. Usually, embeddings dominate
the number of model parameters. For example, more than 99.99%
of parameters in our production model are from feature embed-
dings. Therefore, we start to scale up our model by enlarging the
embedding size 𝐾,e.g., increasing 𝐾from 64to192. However, it
doesn’t bring significant performance lift and sometimes even leads
to performance deterioration.
We investigate the learned embedding matrix of each field by
singular spectral analysis [ 30], and observe dimensional collapse.
That is, many singular values are very small, indicating that em-
beddings of many fields end up spanning a lower-dimensional
subspace instead of the entire available embedding space [ 21,28].
The dimensional collapse of embeddings results in a vast waste of
model capacity since many embedding dimensions collapse and
are meaningless. Furthermore, the fact that many embeddings have
already collapsed makes it infeasible to scale up models by simply
increasing dimension length [2, 21].
We study the root cause of the dimensional collapse and find
it’s due to the explicit feature interaction module, namely, fields
with collapsed dimension make the embeddings of other fields
collapse. For example, some fields such as Gender have very low
cardinality 𝑁Gen, making their embeddings only able to span a
𝑁Gen-dimension space. As 𝑁Genis much smaller than embedding
size𝐾, the interaction between these low-dimension embeddings
and the possibly high-dimensional embedding (in 𝐾-dimensional)
of remaining fields make the latter collapse to an 𝑁Gen-dimensional
subspace.
4.2 Multi-Embedding Paradigm
We propose a multi-embedding paradigm [21] to mitigate embed-
ding dimensional collapse when scaling up ads recommenders.
Specifically, for each feature, instead of looking up only one embed-
ding in the existing single-embedding paradigm, we learn multiple
embedding tables, and look up several embeddings from these table
for each feature. Then, all feature embeddings from the same em-
bedding table interact with each other in the corresponding expert
𝐼. Formally, a recommendation model with 𝑇embedding tables is
defined as:𝒆(𝑡)
𝑖=
𝑬(𝑡)
𝑖⊤
1𝑥𝑖,∀𝑖∈{1,2,...,𝑁},
ℎ(𝑡)=𝐼(𝑡)
𝒆(𝑡)
1,𝒆(𝑡)
2,...,𝒆(𝑡)
𝑁
,
ℎ=1
𝑇𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝑔(𝑡)ℎ(𝑡),ˆ𝑦=𝐹(ℎ),
where𝑡stands for the index of the embedding table, 𝑔denotes
the gating function for each expert, and 𝐹(·)denotes the final
classifier. One requirement is that there should be non-linearities
such as ReLU within the interaction expert 𝐼; otherwise, the model
is equivalent to the single-embedding paradigm [ 21]. An overall
architecture is shown in Figure 1.
The multi-embedding paradigm offers an effective approach to
scaling up recommendation models. Instead of simply increasing
the length of a shared embedding for each feature, this paradigm
involves learning multiple embeddings for each feature . By adopting
the multi-embedding paradigm, we can achieve parameter scaling
for recommendation models, which has traditionally been a chal-
lenging task [ 2]: the model’s performance improves as the number
of parameters increases.
Deployment Details. Almost all pCTR models in our platform
adopt the Multi-Embedding paradigm. Specifically, we learn multi-
ple different feature interaction experts, e.g., GwPFM (a variant of
FFM, which will be described below), IPNN, DCN V2, or FlatDNN,
and multiple embedding tables. One or several experts share one
of these embedding tables. We name such architecture Heteroge-
neous Mixture-of-Experts with Multi-Embedding, which differs from
DHEN [ 75] in the sense that [ 75] employs one shared embedding
table while we deploy multiple ones. For example, the Moments
pCTR model consists of a GwPFM, IPNN [ 51], FlatDNN, and two
embedding tables. GwPFM and FlatDNN share the first table, while
IPNN uses the second one. Switching from a single embedding to
the above architecture brings a 3.9%GMV lift in Moments pCTR,
which is one of the largest performance lifts during the past decade.
4.3 GwPFM: Yet Another Simplified Approach
to Multi-Embedding Paradigm
FFM [ 31] can also be regarded as another approach of the Multi-
Embedding paradigm because FFM also learns multiple embeddings
for each feature. In particular, for a dataset with 𝑀fields, FFM
learns𝑀−1embeddings{𝒆𝑖,𝐹𝑙|𝐹𝑙≠𝐹(𝑖)}for each feature 𝑥𝑖.
When interacting feature 𝑥𝑖with another feature 𝑗, among𝑥𝑖’s
embeddings, FFM chooses the one corresponding to the field of 𝑗,
i.e.,𝒆𝑖,𝐹(𝑗), where𝐹(𝑗)denotes the field of feature 𝑗.
Even though FFM has been proven more effective than FM, it’s
not widely deployed in industry due to its huge space complexity
since it introduces 𝑀−2times more parameters than FM, where 𝑀
is usually at the magnitude of hundreds in practice. To tackle the
high complexity, we propose to decouple the number of embeddings
per feature from the number of fields. Specifically, we group fields
to𝑃field parts and learn𝑃embeddings for each feature, one for
each field part. We choose a small 𝑃to reduce the total model size.
Furthermore, we want to capture the field-pair-wise correlation to
improve performance [ 49]. A straightforward implementation is to
5570KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Junwei Pan et al.
assign a weight for each field pair, but it leads to a computation cost
of𝑂(𝑀2), which is unacceptable. To reduce the computation cost,
we group fields into field groups and learn a weight for each field
group pair. We name this method Group-weighted Part-aware Fac-
torization Machines, or GwPFM in short. The formal representation
of its interaction is:
Φ=⊕∑︁
𝑖=1⊕∑︁
𝑗=𝑖+1𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗⟨𝒆𝑖,𝑃(𝑗),𝒆𝑗,𝑃(𝑖)⟩𝑟𝐺(𝑖),𝐺(𝑗) (4)
where⊕denotes element-wise summation, 𝑃(𝑖)and𝐺(𝑖)de-
notes the field Part or Group of feature 𝑖, and𝑟𝐺(𝑖),𝐺(𝑗)denotes
the learnable weights for field group pair (𝐺(𝑖),𝐺(𝑗)).
Deployment Details. In practice, we split all fields into two parts:
the first one consists of all fields unrelated to the target ads, includ-
ing all user and context-side fields, while the second part consists
of all fields regarding the target ad. We then split all fields of the
first part into 𝐺groups based on expert knowledge, where 𝐺is at
the dozens level, usually less than 50. We don’t further split fields in
the second part to avoid high online inference complexity. That is,
all fields in the second part belong to one field group. The GwPFM
has been deployed in our production since 2018 and has served
many modules and scenarios to this day.
4.4 Beyond Multi-Embedding Paradigm:
Collapse Resilient Feature Interaction
In addition to exploring multiple embeddings, we have conducted
further investigation into the interaction function between two fea-
ture embeddings. The conventional approach, as employed in FM,
conducts an element-wise inner product between the two embed-
dings:𝑓(𝒆𝑖,𝒆𝑗)=𝒆𝑖⊙𝒆𝑗. However, recent research [ 30] has revealed
that directly calculating the distance between two embeddings can
lead to dimensional collapse. To address this issue, researchers ver-
ify that adding a projection matrix upon embeddings before com-
puting the inner product can effectively mitigate the collapse [ 30].
We confirm its efficacy in ads recommendation, that is, incorporat-
ing a field-pair wise projection matrix 𝑀𝐹(𝑖)→𝐹(𝑗)∈R𝐾×𝐾within
feature interaction [ 21,29,58,66] as done in FiBiNET, FmFM and
DCN V2 can also mitigate the dimensional collapse of embeddings
in recommendation. Formally, the interaction function between fea-
ture embedding pair (𝒆𝑖,𝒆𝑗)with a projection matrix 𝑀𝐹(𝑖)→𝐹(𝑗)
is defined as
𝑓Proj(𝒆𝑖,𝒆𝑗)=(𝒆𝑖𝑀𝐹(𝑖)→𝐹(𝑗))⊙𝒆𝑗 (5)
5 TACKLING INTEREST ENTANGLEMENT
User responses in ads recommender systems are driven by their
interests under a specific task or scenario. Recently, there has been
a trend to train multiple tasks or scenarios together to leverage
the information from more tasks/scenarios to enhance prediction
accuracy. However, existing work, e.g., MMoE [ 43] and PLE [ 59],
mainly employ a shared-embedding paradigm [ 6,43,48,59,70],
learning one embedding representation for each user and ad. This
leads to a risk of entangling the learned embedding by the possibly
contradictory user interests from various tasks or scenarios [ 56],
resulting in negative transfer.

It shows the distance distribution of the contradictory user-item pair

Fig. 3 demonstrates the entanglement of user interest in the pub-
lic TikTok dataset, which consists of two tasks: Like and Finish.
We select a set of contradictory user-item pairs 𝑆whose Euclidean
distance is among the bottom-40% regarding single task Like embed-
ding (Fig. 3(a)) and among the top-40% regarding single task Finish
embedding (Fig. 3(b)). We plot the distance distribution of these
pairs regarding the shared embedding from PLE in Fig. 3(c) and
observe that PLE learns large distances for most of them, which is
similar to the distribution of single task Finish, while contradictory
to that of single task Like.
This section presents two approaches to tackle interest entangle-
ment for multi-task/scenario learning and auxiliary learning. In the
following discussion, we take multi-task learning as an example,
and the same principle applies to multi-scenario learning.
5.1 AME for Multi-Task Learning
To tackle such an interest entanglement issue, we adopt a Shared
and Task-specific EMbedding (STEM) paradigm [56], which incor-
porates task-specific embeddings to learn user’s different interest
across tasks, along with a shared embedding. The task-specific em-
beddings disentangle user and item representation (embeddings)
across tasks, making preserving the distinct user interest in different
tasks possible, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 3(e). We then employ a
set of experts, each of which is either task-specific or shared across
tasks. We propose an All Forward Task-specific Backward gating

Figure 4: Architecture illustration of various paradigms. Multi-Embedding (ME) is for single-task learning and doesn’t disentangle repre-
sentations. Shared and Task-specific Embedding (STEM) and Asymmetric Multi-Embedding (AME) are both for multi-task learning. STEM
disentangles representations via task-specific embeddings, while AME achieves disentanglement through learning multiple embedding tables
with different embedding sizes. STEM for Auxiliary Learning (STEM-AL) is for auxiliary learning, which learns task-specific embedding for the
main task and a shared embedding updated by multiple tasks.
mechanism [ 56] for task-specific towers so that each task tower re-
ceives the forward from all experts, while only backward gradients
to its corresponding expert and the shared one.
However, there are many tasks in real-world ads recommenda-
tion systems. For example, each conversion type is usually treated as
a task [ 48] when predicting conversions. There are usually dozens
to hundreds of conversion types, making learning an embedding
table for each task infeasible. Therefore, in practice, we group con-
version types into groups and treat each group as a task. On the
other hand, we decouple the number of embedding tables from
the number of conversion groups, i.e., we learn a fixed number
of embedding tables regardless of the number of groups. We then
rely on the gating mechanism to route between embedding tables
and conversion groups. However, these embedding tables may be
entangled with each other due to their symmetry.
To this end, we set different embedding sizes for these embed-
ding tables to disentangle them, leading to an Asymmetric Multi-
Embedding paradigm, or AME in short, as shown in Figure 4. These
embedding tables are disentangled in the sense that small tasks
with fewer data need less model capacity and are routed more to
the small-size embedding tables via the gating. While the other
tasks with more data require larger model capacity and are routed
to the large-size embedding tables. Other disentangled learning
techniques can also be used [39, 44].
Connections to the Multi-Embedding Paradigm. Multi-Embedding
(ME) paradigm is mainly used for single-task learning to tackle the
embedding dimensional collapse. In contrast, Shared and Task-
specific Embedding (STEM) and Asymmetric Multi-Embedding
(AME) are mainly used to disentangle user interest representations
across various tasks or scenarios. We try to use AME for single-
task learning (e.g., click prediction), but it brings little additional
performance gain upon ME. Similarly, using ME for multi-task
learning leads to Multi-Embedding MMoE (ME-MMoE) [ 56], which
has been proven less effective than STEM [ 56] and AME (in our
online test) since its embeddings are symmetric and hence may still
be entangled.Deployment Details. Our conversion prediction model learns
more than 100conversion types simultaneously. We group these
conversion types into around 30 towers and adopt the asymmetric
multi-embedding (AME) paradigm with three embedding tables of
embedding sizes 16,32, and 64, respectively. Compared to the single
embedding baseline PLE with embedding size 𝐾=64, AME brings
0.32%, 0.24%, and 0.48%average AUC lifts for three representative
scenarios (Moments, Official Accounts, and News), leading to 4.2%,
3.9%, and 7.1%GMV lift in our online A/B test. In particular, the
AUC lifts in small tasks such as Payare0.35%, 0.27%, and 0.78%,
respectively, which are much larger than that on other large tasks.
We also train a PLE model with 𝐾=128to study the effect of model
capacity, but its performance is even worse than the baseline PLE
with𝐾=64.
5.2 STEM-AL for Auxiliary Learning
In industrial recommenders, sometimes we pay more attention to
a main task and want to leverage the signals from other tasks to
improve the performance of this main task. For example, the main
task in click prediction is to predict the convertible click, which
leads to the landing page for further conversions. Besides this valu-
able feedback, we also collect users’ other behaviors regarding the
ad: like, favorite, comment, dislike, and dwell time (on video ads).
We want to enhance the performance of the convertible clicks via
Auxiliary Learning upon these additional tasks.
To prevent these auxiliary tasks from entangling a user’s interest
in the main task, we follow the STEM paradigm [ 56] and adopt a
STEM-based Auxiliary Learning architecture, namely, STEM-AL.
In the following discussion, we’ll treat Task A as the main task and
Task B as the auxiliary one. As shown in Figure 4, different from
STEM and AME, which pay equal attention to all tasks, STEM-AL
treats Task A as the primary one and treats Task B as an auxil-
iary task to improve the performance of A. In particular, STEM-AL
incorporates two embedding tables and two corresponding inter-
action experts. The first embedding table, referred to as the main
embedding table, is exclusively used by the tower of the primary
task A. It is only forwarded to and optimized by the primary task,
ensuring that the main task’s distinctiveness is preserved without
5572KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Junwei Pan et al.
interference from other tasks. The second embedding table, known
as the shared embedding table, is forwarded to and optimized by
the towers of both tasks. This shared embedding table allows Task
A to benefit from the knowledge and insights from Task B. The
auxiliary tower is removed during inference; only the main task’s
tower remains active.
Deployment Details. We deploy STEM-AL to improve the pCTR
in one scenario by samples from other domains. For example, we
take the Applet pCTR as the main task and treat Moments pCTR as
the auxiliary task. By using STEM-AL, the CTR of the main task
can be improved by 1.16%. Further, if we use Moments and Channel
pCTR as the auxiliary task, the CTR on Applet can be improved by
2.93%.
6 MODEL TRAINING
In this section, we describe several training challenges for the model
training in ads recommendation and present our solution. Com-
monly, the click or conversion prediction task is formalized as
a supervised learning problem with the optimization loss L=
1/𝑁Í𝑁
𝑖=1BCE(𝑦𝑖,𝑓(𝑥𝑖)), here𝑦𝑖represents labels with 𝑦𝑖=1de-
noting a positive label (e.g., click in pCTR) and 𝑦𝑖=0denoting a
negative label (e.g., non-click in pCTR), 𝑥𝑖represents the input, and
BCE(𝑦𝑖,𝑓𝑖)=−𝑦𝑖log𝜎(𝑓𝑖)−( 1−𝑦𝑖)log(1−𝜎(𝑓𝑖))is the Binary
Cross Entropy loss.
6.1 Gradient Vanishing and Ranking Loss
Recent work [ 35,53] finds out that incorporating an auxiliary rank-
ing loss with BCE loss has shown substantial performance improve-
ment in online advertising. However, the efficacy of this combina-
tion form is not fully comprehended. We examine its efficiency from
a new perspective [ 40]: that negative samples suffer from gradient
vanishing with only BCE loss when the positive feedback is sparse,
such as in our pCTR model, where only 0.1% to 2% samples are
positive (clicks in pCTR). Instead, after combining BCE with the
ranking loss, we show empirically and theoretically that the gradi-
ents become significantly larger [ 40]. This leads to a lower BCE loss
on both the validation set (indicating better classification ability)
and the training set (indicating a better optimization procedure).
We kindly advise readers to refer to [40] for more details.
Deployment Details. The combination of ranking loss with BCE
loss is widely deployed in the Moments and Channel pCTR models,
with GMV lifts of 0.57% and 1.08%, respectively. It’s also deployed
in all pLTV models, with an LTV GMV lift of 5.99%. Besides, the
prediction bias is also reduced, especially on samples with low
prediction scores.
6.2 Repeated Exposure and Weighted Sampling
Repetitive exposure, that is, displaying the same or similar ads
to users within a short period, can enhance user’s perception of
specific ads but may also risk harming user experience. To tackle
this, we introduced the Repetitive Exposure Weight (REW) module
to decrease the prediction score of repeated ads for a given user to
reduce their exposure. The core idea is to assign higher weights to
the repeated impressions (negative samples).Specifically, for each repeated impression with negative label, we
assign a weight 𝑤rep>=1in the original loss: L=1
𝑁Í𝑁
𝑖=1𝑤rep·
BCE(𝑦𝑖,𝑓(𝑥𝑖)). It considers both the repeated count as well as
recency:𝑤rep=𝛼·𝑤count+(1−𝛼)·𝑤recency , where𝑤count is
proportional to the total number of exposure (time decayed) of
the same or similar ads to this user, and 𝑤recency considers the
time interval between the last repeated impression and the cur-
rent time. Please note that these weights would lead to bias in the
whole model since they upweight negative samples of repeated
exposure. We rectify such bias by involving an additional weight
w𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 =(Í𝑁
𝑖=1(1−𝑦𝑖)·𝑤rep/Í𝑁
𝑖=1(1−𝑦𝑖))for all positive samples.
Deployment Details. The REW module is widely deployed in
Tencent Official Accounts, News, and Video pCTR models, reducing
the percentage of repetitive ads exposure by 14.7%,7.8%, and 9.7%
respectively.
6.3 Online Learning
We train our pCTR and pCVR models with online learning, where
samples are populated in seconds. Online learning for pCVR poses
a special challenge due to conversion delay feedback. There is a lot
of work [ 8,72] to address it. Nevertheless, this method will lead to
pronounced model bias due to substantial fluctuations of conver-
sion feedback in our system. For instance, certain advertisers may
report all previous conversions at uncertain times, resulting in an
exceptionally high observed CVR at that moment, while reporting
no conversions at other times. We propose a dynamic online learn-
ing method based on the conversion feedback variance in response
to these challenges. Specifically, a very small variance means that
the observed CVR is close to the history CVR, so we can populate
the samples as fast as possible. Otherwise, when the variance is
large, we will set a waiting time to ensure the stability of conversion
arrival and reduce the risk of high bias due to arrival fluctuation.
Deployment Details. Our approach has been implemented in
various scenarios for Tencent Ads, including pCVR models for
Tencent Moments, Channel, and Official accounts, with overall
GMV lift of 0.3%, 1.49%, 1.14%, and new ad GMV lift of 2.48%, 0.8%,
4.34% respectively, where the new ads refer to ads that have been
online within three days. Besides, the bias of new ads in all scenarios
has decreased from over 10% to within 1%.
6.4 Exploration with Uncertainty Estimates
So far, our focus is on enhancing the models’ ability to accurately
predict click or conversion rates, utilizing these scores to rank ads
and maximize exploitation while neglecting the exploration. How-
ever, extensive research has demonstrated the criticality of striking
a balance between exploration and exploitation, particularly for
cold-start ads. Consequently, we propose adopting a Bayesian per-
spective for CTR modeling, wherein instead of predicting a single
point estimate for CTR, we predict a distribution that incorporates
uncertainty estimations.
To achieve this, we introduce a Gaussian process (GP) prior distri-
bution to represent the unknown true CTR function. We leverage ob-
served data to obtain predictions and uncertainty estimations from
the posterior distribution. Combining these uncertainty estimates
with well-established bandit algorithms, specifically Thompson
5573Ads Recommendation in a Collapsed and Entangled World KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
Sampling (TS), enables us to manage the exploration-exploitation
trade-off and enhance long-term utilities effectively. Formally,

where𝜇(x★)andΣ(x★)denotes the mean and variance of the
posterior logit value 𝑓(x★)for test data point x★.
Deployment Details. The GP-based model is deployed in Tencent
Moments pCTR, with GMV lift of +1.92%.
7 ANALYSIS TOOLS
In this section, we present several off-the-shelf analysis tools on
representation learning to analyze the correlation between features,
check whether and to what extent embeddings collapse, and exam-
ine the entanglement of user interest. We release the analysis code
in this repository: https://github.com/junwei-pan/RecScope.
7.1 Feature Correlation
We can measure both ground-truth and learned feature correla-
tion on particular samples or feature combinations via mutual
information [ 49,82]. The ground-truth correlation can be calcu-
lated by the mutual information between features 𝑋and the user’s
response(label) 𝑌under certain constraints. In particular, when
handling sequential features, we’d like to measure the semantic-
temporal correlation between behaviors with specific categories
while at specific position 𝑋con𝑏, and the user’s response on targets
of specific categories 𝑌con𝑡. After defining the constraints on be-
haviors and the target, e.g.,con𝑏andcon𝑡, the correlation can be
quantified as
Cor=MI(𝑋con𝑏,𝑌con𝑡) (7)
For example, we can first select a subset of samples with target
category𝑐𝑡, and then for behaviors with category 𝑐𝑖while at various
positions𝑝(or with various time intervals), we can quantify the
correlation as
Cor=MI(𝑋𝐶(𝑋)=𝑐𝑖∧𝑃(𝑋)=𝑝,𝑌𝐶(𝑌)=𝑐𝑡) (8)
Using this metric, we do observe both strong semantic correla-
tion, i.e., behaviors belonging to the same category as the target
exhibit a stronger correlation than those of other categories, and
strong temporal correlation, i.e., there is a compelling correlation
decrease from the most recent behaviors to the oldest ones. Please
kindly refer to [82] for more details.
7.2 Embedding Dimensional Collapse
Dimensional collapse happens when embedding vectors span in a
lower-dimensional subspace. Following the work of [ 30], we can
measure dimensional collapse by conducting a singular value de-
composition (SVD) of the embedding matrix of each field. In partic-
ular, given an embedding matrix of field 𝑖:𝑬𝑖∈R𝑁𝑖×𝐾, after the
SVD 𝑬𝑖=𝑈Σ𝑉∗,Σ=𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(𝜎𝑘), we can get the singular values 𝜎𝑘.
Dimensional collapse happens when some singular values are small.
Besides, we can further quantify the dimensional collapse of an em-
bedding matrix by a new metric: Information Abundance (IA) [ 21],
which is defined as the sum of all singular values normalized by
the maximum singular value.7.3 Interest Entanglement
User responses in ads recommender systems are driven by many
factors behind the users’ decision-making processes. We can mea-
sure such factor entanglement by selecting a set of contradictory
user-item pairs 𝑆whose embedding distances are large in one task
but low in another. We then plot the distance distribution of 𝑆based
on: a) embeddings from each single task model, b) the embeddings
of a shared-embedding multi-task learning model, e.g., PLE, c) the
embeddings of each task as well as the shared embedding in STEM.
An example of such analysis is already shown in Fig. 3.
8 RELATED WORK
Feature Encoding. Modeling sequence of user behaviorss have
been widely studied [ 10,17,25,32,50,57,80,81]. Regarding nu-
merical features, existing work can be categorized into two groups:
non-discretization [ 13,47,51] and discretization [ 9,19]. Recently,
with huge growth in research on LLM, lots of work has been done on
how to utilize embeddings learned from these external pre-trained
models in recommendation systems [26, 27, 36, 38, 73, 79].
Feature Interactions and Dimensional Collapse. There are
numerous work on the backbone architecture with explicit or
implicit feature interaction, from the shallow models FM [ 52],
FFM [ 31], FwFM [ 49] and FmFM [ 58], to deep models such as
Wide & Deep [ 12], DeepFM [ 20], xDeepFM [ 37], AutoInt [ 55], DCN
V2 [66] and FinalMLP [ 45]. Refer to [ 71,76] for a comprehensive
survey.
The complete collapse has been widely studied in self-supervised
learning (SSL) [ 11,67], and Mixtures-of-Experts (MoE) [ 30]. On the
other hand, dimensional collapse has been studied in SSL [ 28] and
contrastive learning [30].
Interest Entanglement under MTL and MDL. Negative transfer
has been a critical challenge in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and
Multi-Domain Learning (MDL). Shared-embedding paradigm is
widely adopted in either MTL [ 6,43,48,59,70] and MDL [ 7,54,83].
Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) aims to identify and
disentangle the underlying explanatory factors [3] in embeddings
and has also been widely used in recommendation [39, 44, 68, 69].
Industry Systems. There are already several works on industrial
recommender systems [ 13–15,24,42,46,65,74]. We differ from
these works in that we pay more attention to the representation,
especially from a dimensional collapse and interest entanglement
perspective.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we describe an industry ads recommendation system,
paying special attention to the representation learning perspec-
tive. We present how to encode features with inherent priors, as
well as practices to tackle the dimensional collapse and interest
entanglement issue. We also showcase several training techniques
and analysis tools. We hope this work can shed light on the future
development of this research area.
