ABSTRACT
Driven by the powerful representation ability of Graph Neural Net-
works (GNNs), plentiful GNN models have been widely deployed
in many real-world applications. Nevertheless, due to distribution
disparities between different demographic groups, fairness in high-
stake decision-making systems is receiving increasing attention.
Although lots of recent works devoted to improving the fairness
of GNNs and achieved considerable success, they all require signif-
icant architectural changes or additional loss functions requiring
more hyper-parameter tuning. Surprisingly, we find that simple
re-balancing methods can easily match or surpass existing fair GNN
methods. We claim that the imbalance across different demographic
groups is a significant source of unfairness, resulting in imbalanced
contributions from each group to the parameters updating. How-
ever, these simple re-balancing methods have their own shortcom-
ings during training. In this paper, we propose FairGB, FairGraph
Neural Network via re- Balancing, which mitigates the unfairness
of GNNs by group balancing. Technically, FairGB consists of two
modules: counterfactual node mixup and contribution alignment
loss. Firstly, we select counterfactual pairs across inter-domain
and inter-class, and interpolate the ego-networks to generate new
samples. Guided by analysis, we can reveal the debiasing mecha-
nism of our model by the causal view and prove that our strategy
can make sensitive attributes statistically independent from tar-
get labels. Secondly, we reweigh the contribution of each group
according to gradients. By combining these two modules, they can
mutually promote each other. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results
concerning both utility and fairness metrics. Code is available at

1 INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of deep learning, Graph Neural Net-
works (GNNs) have been widely used in dealing with non-Euclidean
graph-structured data and gained a deeper understanding to help us
perform predictive tasks, such as social network analysis [ 33] and
molecular property prediction [ 6,55]. However, potential bias in
datasets will lead the neural networks to favor the privileged groups,
for example, if the historical data reflects a bias towards loans for in-
dividuals from higher-income communities, the model may learn to
associate high income with loan approval, leading to the unjustified
denial of loans for applicants from lower-income communities even
if they are creditworthy. Therefore, fairness in high-stake automatic
decision-making systems, e.g., medication recommendation [ 45],
fraud detection [ 29,38], and credit risk prediction [ 57] have been
receiving increasing attention in recent years.
Close to the heels of the wide application of GNNs, there are
various fair GNN approaches have been proposed to improve fair-
ness without unduly compromising utility performance [ 1,9,11–
14,34,54,58]. The two most typical strategies of fair GNNs are
imposing the fairness consideration as a regularization term dur-
ing optimization [ 9,18,48,54] or modifying the original training
data with the assumption that fair data would result in a fair model
[12,44]. However, previous works focus on eliminating information
about sensitive attributes but overlook the fact that due to attribute
imbalance, underprivileged groups with fewer training samples are
underrepresented compared to the privileged groups with more
training samples. Inspired by recent work in maximizing worst-
group-accuracy [ 20], we surprisingly observe that simple group-
wise re-balancing methods (e.g., re-sampling and re-weighting)
can easily achieve competitive or even superior results compared
to existing state-of-the-art fair GNN models with no additional
hyper-parameters (as shown in Figure 1). Data re-balancing meth-
ods are popular within the class imbalance literature, but we focus
on balancing each group in this paper, which we refer to as group-
wise re-balancing (without the loss of generality, we abbreviate

it as re-balancing). However, these simple re-balancing methods
have their own shortcomings on the imbalanced graph-structured
datasets. (1) Re-sampling: Down- and over-sampling will miti-
gate imbalance distribution by dropping or duplicating training
samples. However down-sampling will lose a lot of beneficial infor-
mation from the training set, jeopardizing the utility of the model.
While over-sampling simply repeats minority samples will cause an
over-fitting problem and hard to connect adjacent edges of newly
generated nodes because of non-iid characteristics of graphs. (2)
Re-weighting: re-weighting methods apply penalties according to
the quantity of groups and assign large weights to minor groups.
However, up-weighing nodes in minor groups may also result in the
over-fitting problem, and inevitably increase the false positive cases
for major nodes [ 47]. Several works attempt to alleviate the class
imbalance in the node classification scenario [ 28,31,39,47]. For in-
stance, GraphENS [ 39] injects the whole synthesized ego-networks
for minor class. TAM [ 47] designs a node-wise logit adjustment
method, which adaptively adjusts the margin accordingly based on
local topology. However they did not take into account sub-groups
within the classes, and to the best of our knowledge, there has been
no work addressing unfairness in GNNs from the perspective of
re-balancing.
To address the above problems, we propose a novel fair GNN
model, FairGraph Neural Networks via re- Balancing, FairGB for
short. Our proposed model can be divided into two modules: Coun-
terfactual Node Mixup (CNM) and Contribution Alignment Loss
(CAL). Specifically, we first select inter-domain (with the same tar-
get labels and different sensitive attributes) and inter-class (with
different target labels and the same sensitive attributes) nodes for
each training sample as counterexamples. Then we interpolate
node attributes and neighbor distributions of counterfactual pairs
and inject newly synthesized ego-networks to generate a balanced
augmented graph. We have performed theoretical analysis over
causal and statistical views, which serves as a solid mathematical
foundation for the effectiveness of debiasing. Secondly, because the
importance of each training sample varies, achieving balance solely
based on quantity is not sufficient. To further improve fairness,
we propose a re-weighting method, Contribution Alignment Loss,
which can balance the contribution of each group according to the
gradients. The weights can be flexibly combined with CNM, thus
we can view FairGB as a hybrid model, where CNM is equivalentto re-sampling, CAL is a re-weighting strategy. They mutually rein-
force each other, helping to alleviate the issues encountered by the
simple re-balancing methods mentioned above. Our contributions
can be listed as follows:
•Preliminary Analysis. We find that simple re-balancing meth-
ods can easily achieve competitive or superior results compared
to existing state-of-the-art fair GNN models. And we provide a
new perspective to analyze the fairness in graph learning.
•Algorithm Design. We propose a novel approach, namely FairGB,
that can effectively improve performance via re-balancing meth-
ods with only one additional hyper-parameter. And we theoreti-
cally prove that our approach can achieve the debiasing effect.
•Experimental Evaluation. We conduct extensive experiments,
and the results demonstrate that FairGB achieves superior per-
formance of utility and fairness. Meanwhile, we observe that the
decision boundaries of target labels and sensitive attributes are
roughly orthogonal, which indicates they are independent.
2 PRELIMINARY
2.1 Notations and Problem Statements
Given an attributed graph G=(V,A,X), whereV={𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑁}
is the set of nodes; A∈R𝑁×𝑁is the adjacency matrix, 𝑁is
the number of nodes, if 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗are connected, A𝑖𝑗=1, oth-
erwise A𝑖𝑗=0;X=[x1,x2,...,x𝑁] ∈R𝑁×𝐷is the node fea-
ture matrix, each node 𝑣𝑖is associated with a 𝐷-dimensional node
feature vector x𝑖. The low-dimensional representations of nodes
Z=[z1,z2....,z𝑁] ∈R𝑁×𝑑are derived from graph encoder
𝑔(·):R𝑁×𝐷×R𝑁×𝑁→R𝑁×𝑑. On the top of the graph encoder,
there is a classifier head ℎ(·):R𝑁×𝑑→R𝑁×𝐶to obtain the proba-
bility of each class, where 𝐶is the number of classes. Combining
graph encoder 𝑔(·)and classifier head ℎ(·), we can acquire graph
model𝑓𝜃=𝑔◦ℎ(·), where𝜃is the learnable parameters.
In fairness learning or debiased learning, each labeled sample
is a triad,(𝑣,𝑦,𝑠)∼V×Y×S , with𝑦being the ground-truth
label and𝑠being the sensitive attributes. If the nodes have the
same target label 𝑦and sensitive attribute 𝑠, we define them as a
demographic group D𝑦,𝑠, and the quantity of the group is |D𝑦,𝑠|.
The goal of fairness learning is that the model will not be affected
by the sensitive features, resulting in the bias of predicted results ˆ𝑦.
Assume there is a binary classification task, target label Y={1,0},
sensitive attributeS={1,0}. There are two corresponding metrics
to evaluate fairness.
2.1.1 Demographic Parity. If the predicted result ˆ𝑦is independent
of sensitive attributes, i.e.,ˆ𝑦⊥𝑠, then we can consider demographic
parity is achieved. The formula for this criterion is as follows:
𝑃(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑠=0)=𝑃(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑠=1) (1)
If a model satisfies demographic parity, the acceptance rate of dif-
ferent protected groups is the same.
2.1.2 Equalized Odds. If the predicted results and sensitive at-
tributes are independent conditional on the ground-truth label, i.e.,
ˆ𝑦⊥𝑠|𝑦, then we consider equalized odds is achieved. The formula
for it is as follows:
𝑃(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑠=1,𝑦=1)=𝑃(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑠=0,𝑦=1) (2)
 
1737Rethinking Fair Graph Neural Networks from Re-balancing KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
If a model satisfies equalized odds, the TPR (True Positive Rate) and
FPR (False Positive Rate) for the two protected groups are the same.
2.2 Graph Neural Networks
Most existing GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm which
contains message aggregation and feature update, such as GCN [ 26]
and GAT [ 53]. They generate node representations by iteratively
aggregating information of neighbors and updating them with non-
linear functions. The forward process can be defined as:
z(𝑙)
𝑖=U
ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑖,M({z(𝑙−1)
𝑖,z(𝑙−1)
𝑗|𝑣𝑗∈N𝑖})
(3)
where z(𝑙)
𝑖is the feature vector of node 𝑖in the𝑙-th layer, andN𝑖is
a set of neighbor nodes of node 𝑖.Mdenotes the message passing
function of aggregating neighbor information, Udenotes the update
function with central node feature and neighbor node features as
input. By stacking multiple layers, GNNs can aggregate messages
from higher-order neighbors.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we will give a detailed description of FairGB. An
illustration of its framework is shown in Figure 2. In the Counter-
factual Node Mixup (CNM), we select counterfactual pairs for each
training sample and conduct inter-domain and inter-class mixup
with whole ego-networks. In the Contribution Alignment Loss
(CAL), we further improve the group-wise balance by re-weighting
each group according to the gradients. Next, we will provide a
theoretical analysis and introduce the details of each module.
3.1 Counterfactual Node Mixup
Recently, the incorporation of causal learning techniques into GNNs
has ignited a plethora of groundbreaking studies [ 15,18,21,49].
This is attributed to the fact that addressing trustworthiness con-
cerns is more effectively achieved by capturing the inherent causal-
ity in the underlying data, as opposed to merely relying on su-
perficial correlations. In this work, we present a causal view of
the union of the graph data generation and the GNNs’ prediction
process as a Structure Causal Model [ 42] (as shown in Figure 3(a)).
We illustrate the causal relationships among six variables in the
node classification problem: unobservable causal variable 𝐶, un-
observable sensitive (bias) variable 𝑆, observable node attributes
X, observable topology A, node embedding Z, and ground-truth
label Y. In the graph data generation process, 𝐶→X←𝑆and
𝐶→A←𝑆demonstrate that two variables (causal variable 𝐶
and sensitive variable 𝑆) construct two components of observable
contextual subgraphs (node attributes Xand topology A), which is
different from i.i.d. data only consider attributes. X→Z←Aand
Z→Yindicate existing GNNs produce representations and pre-
dictions based on observable contextual subgraphs. 𝐶e𝑆denotes
the spurious correlation between 𝐶and𝑆.
Inspired by Fan et al . [15] , we analyze the SCM according to
𝑑-connection theory [ 41] (two variables are dependent if they are
connected by at least one unblocked path ). Thus we can find three
paths between sensitive variable 𝑆and group-truth label Y:
•𝑆→X→Z→Yand𝑆→A→Z→Y: Because the existing
graph neural networks make prediction for a node based onits contextual subgraph, sensitive variable 𝑆will influence the
final prediction not only through node attributes Xbut also
topology A[30]. This makes fairness in graph machine learning
more complex compared to other modalities (e.g., images and
languages). As a result, if we want to sever all unblocked paths
between𝑆andY, we need to debias both XandA.
•𝑆e𝐶→Y: we want to sever the connection between 𝑆and
𝐶, so we utilize inter-domain and inter-class mixup. Intuitively,
we interpolate samples with the same target label but different
sensitive attributes in inter-domain mixup, and then the model
can focus on class-specific information and learn domain in-
variant features. Besides, we also interpolate samples with the
same sensitive attribute and different target labels in inter-class
mixup, which can smooth the decision surface and alleviate the
dependency on bias information.
Furthermore, we can also explain counterfactual mixup is equiv-
alent to re-sampling methods. As shown in Figure 3(b), we observe
that the original group distribution is imbalanced, which could lead
to unfairness during training. However, in the inter-domain mixup,
counterfactual samples can balance the bias distribution within
each class (i.e., 𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑖)=𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑗),∀𝑖,𝑗∈𝑆). In the
inter-class mixup, counterfactual samples can make the bias dis-
tribution consistent within each class (i.e., 𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑖)=𝑃(𝑆=
𝑠|𝑌=𝑗),∀𝑖,𝑗∈𝑌). The following theorem builds a theoretical
analysis of the debiasing capability of counterfactual mixup.
Theorem 1. Let𝑌and𝑆be target labels and sensitive attributes.
Balanced and consistent bias distribution within each class can make
𝑆statistically independent from 𝑌, i.e.,𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑠)=𝑃(𝑌=𝑦).
Proof. ❶Inter-domain mixup: If 𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑖)=𝑃(𝑌=
𝑦|𝑆=𝑗),∀𝑖,𝑗∈𝑆, given𝑠∈𝑆then:
𝑃(𝑌=𝑦)=∑︁
𝑠∈𝑆𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑠)𝑃(𝑆=𝑠), (4)
Based on the premise condition, we can rewrite Eq. 4 as:
𝑃(𝑌=𝑦)=𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑠)∑︁
𝑠′∈𝑆𝑃(𝑆=𝑠′)=𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑠)(5)
❷Inter-class mixup: If 𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑖)=𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑗),∀𝑖,𝑗∈𝑌,
given𝑦∈𝑌then:
𝑃(𝑆=𝑠)=∑︁
𝑦∈𝑌𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑦)𝑃(𝑌=𝑦) (6)
Based on the premise condition, we can rewrite Eq. 6 as:
𝑃(𝑆=𝑠)=𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑦)∑︁
𝑦′∈𝑌𝑃(𝑌=𝑦′)=𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑦)(7)
Subsequently, using Bayesian probability we can get:
𝑃(𝑌=𝑦|𝑆=𝑠)=𝑃(𝑆=𝑠|𝑌=𝑦)𝑃(𝑌=𝑦)
𝑃(𝑆=𝑠)(8)
=𝑃(𝑆=𝑠)𝑃(𝑌=𝑦)
𝑃(𝑆=𝑠)(9)
=𝑃(𝑌=𝑦) (10)
Thus, we have completed the proof of Theorem 1. □

Although some literature provided similar theoretical analysis
based on the statistical view [ 43,51], they did not conduct a detailed
analysis of the debiasing mechanism of balanced and consistent
bias distribution within each class.
Next, we are going to introduce the detailed process of coun-
terfactual node mixup. Specifically, for each training node 𝑣𝑖, we
randomly select a node 𝑣𝑗that has the same target label and a differ-
ent sensitive attribute with 𝑣𝑖(𝑦𝑖=𝑦𝑗,𝑠𝑖≠𝑠𝑗) as an inter-domain
counterexample. In the same way, we randomly select a node 𝑣𝑗
that has a different target label and the same sensitive attribute
with𝑣𝑖(𝑦𝑖≠𝑦𝑗,𝑠𝑖=𝑠𝑗) as an inter-class counterexample. Here, we
introduce a hyper-parameter 𝜂, which is responsible for controlling
the ratio between two kinds of counterexamples. Then we performlinear interpolation on the node attributes:
x𝑚𝑖𝑥=𝜆x𝑖+(1−𝜆)x𝑗, 𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑥=𝜆𝑦𝑖+(1−𝜆)𝑦𝑗, (11)
where𝜆∈[0,1]is the interpolation ratio that is sampled from a
Beta distribution. After generating new node attributes, we need to
insert these nodes into the original graph. According to the analysis
above, we also perform mixup on the contextual subgraph structure.
We define the neighbor distribution of node 𝑣𝑖as𝑝N(𝑣𝑖)where
𝑝(𝑣𝑘|𝑣𝑖)=1
|N𝑖|, ifA𝑖𝑘=1, and𝑝(𝑣𝑘|𝑣𝑖)=0otherwise. Then
we directly interpolate the neighbor distribution of counterfactual
pairs using the same 𝜆:
𝑝N(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥)=𝜆𝑝N(𝑣𝑖)+(1−𝜆)𝑝N(𝑣𝑗), (12)
Thus we can obtain newly generated unbiased ego-networks. How-
ever, these ego-networks have very dense structures, which could
violate the original degree distribution and result in the phenome-
non of out-of-distribution [ 32,50]. Therefore, we sample the neigh-
bors according to the original degree distribution and inject newly
generated unbiased ego-networks into the original graph to con-
struct an augmented graph G𝑎𝑢𝑔.
3.2 Contribution Alignment Loss
Although counterfactual node mixup is equivalent to re-sampling
to some extent, varying levels of learning difficulty and the different
positions of labeled nodes [ 5] lead to inconsistent contributions of
training nodes. Simply balancing the group distribution in terms
of quantity does not effectively address the problem. To further
balance the contribution of each group and enhance fairness, we
align the gradients of each group.
Since FairGB first generates mixed nodes through counterfactual
node mixup and calculates the loss on these mixed nodes, it is
difficult for us to determine which group the mixed nodes actually
belong to. However, we can acquire the contributions of mixed
nodes to each group by rewriting the loss function. First, we claim
 
1739Rethinking Fair Graph Neural Networks from Re-balancing KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
that the objective loss function of counterfactual mixup is as follows:
L=E{𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑗}[ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑥)], (13)
=E{𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑗}[𝜆ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑖)+(1−𝜆)ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑗)], (14)
whereℓis Cross-Entropy loss. Then we can obtain two contribu-
tions of each mixed node according to the gradients:
𝑟𝑖=∥∇𝑓ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑖)∥1, 𝑟𝑗=∥∇𝑓ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑗)∥1, (15)
In essence,𝑟𝑖and𝑟𝑗are the contributions generated from mixed
two nodes𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗. We can easily identify which group are 𝑣𝑖
and𝑣𝑗belong to. Therefore, the contribution of each group 𝑅𝑡,𝑏is
the sum of sample contributions (both original samples and coun-
terexamples), 𝑅𝑡,𝑏=Í|D𝑡,𝑏|
𝑣𝑖∈D𝑡,𝑏𝑟𝑖. Based on𝑅𝑡,𝑏, we can compute
the weight of each group 𝑤𝑡,𝑏=Í𝐶×𝐵
𝑗,𝑘𝑅𝑗,𝑘/𝑅𝑡,𝑏to balance the
contributions, where 𝐵is the number of sensitive attributes. After
obtaining the weights of each group, we can flexibly inject them
into the objective loss function Eq. 14 to get the final Contribution
Alignment Loss (CAL):
L𝐶𝐴𝐿=E{𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑗}[𝑤𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖𝜆ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑖)+𝑤𝑦𝑗,𝑠𝑗(1−𝜆)ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑚𝑖𝑥),𝑦𝑗)],
(16)
So far, we have achieved an ingenious combination of counterfac-
tual node mixup and contribution alignment. They can complement
and promote each other. Specifically, counterfactual node mixup
can sever the spurious correlation from the causal view but it does
not guarantee a good balance between different groups. While
contribution alignment loss is able to balance the contribution of
each group based on gradients, but it will suffer the over-fitting
problem, which can be mitigated by the newly generated unbiased
ego-networks. The whole training procedure of FairGB is presented
in Algorithm 1.
4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate
the effectiveness of our proposed model, and aim to answer the
following research questions:
•RQ1: Compared to other baselines, can FairGB achieve better
performance w.r.t. utility and fairness?
•RQ2: How does each component affect the model performance?
•RQ3: What are the characteristics of the node features generated
by FairGB compared to vanilla?
•RQ4: Can FairGB generalize well to different graph encoders?
•RQ5: How do hyper-parameters affect FairGB?
4.1 Experimental settings
4.1.1 Real-World Datasets. We conduct experiments on three widely
used real-world datasets, namely German Credit, Bail, and Credit
Defaulter. The statistics of the datasets can be found in Table 1. The
details of the datasets are as follows:
•German Credit [2]: the nodes in the dataset are clients and two
nodes are connected if they have a high similarity of the credit
accounts. The task is to classify the credit risk level as high or
low with the sensitive attribute "gender".
•Bail [23]: these datasets contain defendants released on bail
during 1990-2009 as nodes. The edges between the two nodes are
connected based on the similarity of past criminal records andAlgorithm 1: FairGB: Fair Graph Neural Networks via re-

4.1.2 Baselines. We compare our proposed model with 9 repre-

include: (1) Vanilla graph neural networks: GCN [ 26] is widely
used spectral GNN; GraphSAGE (SAGE for short) [ 19] is a method
for inductive learning that leverages node feature information to
generate embedding for nodes in large graph; GIN [ 56] is a graph-
based neural network that can capture different topological struc-
tures by injecting the node’s identity into its aggregation func-
tion. (2) Fair node classification methods: FairGNN [ 9] uses
adversarial training to achieve fairness on graphs; EDITS [ 12] is a
pre-processing method for fair graph learning. (3) Graph counter-
factual fairness methods: NIFTY [ 1] simply performs a flipping
on the sensitive attributes to get counterfactual data; CAF [ 18] is

guided by causal analysis, which can select counterfactual from
training data to avoid non-realistic counterfactuals and adopt se-
lected counterfactuals to learn fair node representations. (4) Simple
re-balancing methods: Re-weighting (RW for short) up-weights
the contribution of minority groups and down-weights the contri-
bution of majority groups to the loss functions according to the
quantity of groups. More concretely, the objective loss function
isL=1
𝑁Í𝑁
𝑖=1𝑁
|D𝑦𝑖,𝑠𝑖|ℓ(𝑓(𝑣𝑖),𝑦𝑖). Over-sampling (OS for short)
repeatedly samples minority group samples until the number of
each group data reaches the maximum number of group data. We
duplicate the edges of the original node when adding an oversam-
pled node to the original graph. Following the setting of CAF [ 18],
we also use SAGE as the model backbone except for GCN and GIN.
4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. We regard AUC, F1 score, and accuracy
as utility metrics. For fairness metrics, we use statistical parity
(SP)Δ𝑠𝑝and equal opportunity (EO) Δ𝑒𝑜, a smaller fairness metric
indicates a fairer model decision.
4.1.4 Implementation details. For German, Bail, and Credit datasets,
we follow train/valid/test split in [ 1]. The hyper-parameters used
in experiments follow the source codes or are searched by the grid
search method, and we use the Adam optimization algorithm [ 25]
to train all the models. Specifically, FairGB only has one additional
hyper-parameter 𝜂, and it is searched from {0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.8, 0.9,
1}. All the models are implemented in PyTorch [ 40] version 2.0.1
with PyTorch Geometric [17] version 2.3.1.
4.2 RQ1: Performance comparison
To comprehensively understand the effectiveness of FairGB, we
conduct node classification on three widely used datasets. The ex-
perimental results of utility and fairness of each model are shown in
Table 2. From the Table 2, our observations can be threefold: (1) We
can observe that simple re-balancing methods achieve satisfactory
results in both utility and fairness on three datasets. They can obtain
competitive or even superior performance compared to carefullydesigned fair GNN models. (2) FairGB consistently achieves the best
performance on the utility-fairness trade-off on all datasets. We use
the average rank of three utility metrics and two fairness metrics to
understand the performance of the trade-off. Our model ranks 2.47
and the runner-up model ranks 3.27. Our model outperforms all
four categories of baselines, which shows the effectiveness of our
model. (3) We find that OS and FairGB, on bail and credit datasets,
do not sacrifice utility while improving fairness. For instance, on
the bail dataset, FairGB improves the AUC by 4.50%, the F1 by
7.83%, and Acc by 4.54% compared to the vanilla model. And on
the credit dataset, FairGB improves F1 by 4.19%, and Acc by 4.70%
compared to the vanilla model. We speculate that this may be due
to two reasons: (i) Balance of contributions from each group leads
to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the worst group;
(ii) the re-balancing strategy enhances the model’s generalization,
resulting in an overall improvement in classification performance.
4.3 RQ2: Ablation study
To answer RQ2 and verify the effectiveness of our proposed FairGB,
we construct two variants of FairGB: (1) without Contribution
Alignment Loss but conduct node mixup within counterfactual
pairs (called FairGB w/o CAL); (2) without Counterfactual Node
Mixup but assigns weights based on the group contribution (called
FairGB w/o CNM). Table 3 demonstrates the performance of the
vanilla model, two variants, and FairGB. First, we observe that two
variants perform worse than FairGB in the trade-off of utility and
fairness, which proves the effectiveness of each component and the
rationality of the combination. Second, we find that FairGB w/o
CNM consistently achieves better fairness compared to FairGB w/o
CAL, which indicates the importance of re-balancing in fair graph
learning. However, as mentioned above, re-weighting methods will
encounter over-fitting problems, and counterfactual node mixup
will generate new samples per epoch, which could mitigate over-
fitting. Third, while both modules effectively enhance fairness, the
impact on utility varies across different datasets for each variant. For

example, FairGB w/o CAL achieves high utility on the bail dataset
but does not show improvement on the credit dataset, whereas
FairGB w/o CNM exhibited the opposite trend. We speculate that
this may be due to the different sizes of labeled nodes in the two
datasets. The bail dataset has a small number of training samples
(only 100 nodes are labeled), leading to over-fitting issues with re-
weighting. Mixup, on the other hand, is beneficial for training with
few labels. In the credit dataset, there are a lot of training samples
(4000 nodes are labeled), and the phenomenon is just the opposite.
However, we can observe that FairGB competently incorporates
the strengths of each module, demonstrating that the two modules
can mutually reinforce each other.
4.4 RQ3: Visualization
In order to answer the RQ3, we visualize the learned node embed-
dings on the bail dataset to better understand the mechanism of
FairGB. We compare our FairGB with the vanilla GNN model (i.e.
SAGE), and then use 16-dimensional output embedding of the en-
coder. Subsequently, we use t-SNE [ 52] to map the 16-dimensional
embedding into 2-dimensional space for visualization. We only
select samples in the test set for better visibility. The results are
shown in Figure 4. We plot two figures for each model, one con-
cerns the target labels, and the other one concerns the sensitive
attributes. Comparing Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(c), we can observe
that the representations of nodes from different classes have smalleroverlapping regions in FairGB. This confirms the improvement of
FairGB on the three utility metrics. Next, since SAGE already ex-
hibits good fairness on the bail dataset (as shown in Table 2), we can
observe that the node representations of the two sensitive attributes
are mixed together in Figure 4(b). Because FairGB is designed from
a re-balancing perspective, the contributions from each group are
relatively balanced, making the node representations of the two
sensitive attributes distinguishable in FairGB. However, we can
observe that the classification boundary for the target label is or-
thogonal to the classification boundary for the sensitive features.
This explains how FairGB achieves excellent fairness.
4.5 RQ4: Generalization for different encoders
To answer the RQ4, we test the generalization ability of our FairGB
by deploying it on three different graph encoders: SAGE, GCN,
and GIN. The utility and fairness performance are demonstrated in
Figure 5. We can observe that FairGB is able to maintain or even
surpass the vanilla models in both AUC and F1-score metrics, which
is thanks to the re-balancing strategy. In the fairness metrics, we
find that FairGB effectively reduces Δ𝑠𝑝andΔ𝑒𝑜compared to the
vanilla models across all datasets. These results indicate that FairGB
has strong generalization capabilities for different graph encoders,
making it flexible for use in real-world applications.
4.6 RQ5: Parameter sensitive analysis
One major advantage of FairGB is that it only has one additional
hyper-parameter 𝜂to control the trade-off between inter-domain
mixup and inter-class mixup. To figure out the RQ5, we conduct
hyper-parameter sensitive analysis on three datasets in terms of
three utility metrics and two fairness metrics. As shown in Figure 6,
we vary𝜂from 0 to 1 and present the performance of FairGB.
When𝜂equals 0, the model only performs inter-domain mixup, and
when𝜂equals 1, the model only performs inter-class mixup. Recall
our above analysis, when the training set is class-balanced, inter-
domain mixup is equivalent to group-wise balance re-sampling.
But according to our causal view, we demonstrate that plain inter-
domain mixup can not effectively mitigate bias, so we conduct
inter-class mixup and add a hyper-parameter 𝜂to control the trade-
off. We can observe that when 𝜂equals 0 or 1, FairGB can not
achieve the best performance. However, when 𝜂is within the range
of 0.3 to 0.8, the model is not sensitive to parameters and FairGB
achieves the roughly best performance when 𝜂equals 0.5. Therefore,
we simply fix the 𝜂to 0.5 in most experiments.

5 RELATED WORK
5.1 Fairness in Graph Neural Networks
Fairness is a widely researched issue in the field of machine learning
[3,4,7,35]. Most works in deep learning exclusively focus on opti-
mizing the model utility while ignoring the fairness of the decisions,
such as group fairness [ 4,10], individual fairness [ 37,46], and coun-
terfactual fairness [ 8,27]. Since GNNs inherit characteristics from
machine learning, they can also encounter fairness issues, which
makes it challenging to deploy GNNs in high-risk applications.
Nowadays, there are various existing works that try to improve
the fairness of GNNs, and they can be roughly categorized into
pre-, in-, and post-processing methods. Pre-processing methods
modify the original training data with the assumption that fair
data would result in fair models. Fairwalk [ 44] and Crosswalk
[24] choose each group of neighbor nodes with an equal chance
and bias random walks to cross group boundaries. EDITS [ 12]
designs a model-agnostic method to modify the attribute and struc-
ture for fair GNNs training. In-processing approaches aim to mit-
igate unfairness during the training process by directly modify-
ing the learning algorithm, and they can be divided into three
parts: adversarial-based, augmentation-based, and message-passing-
based. Adversarial-based approaches train fair GNNs by preventing
an adversary from correctly predicting sensitive attributes from
the learned node representations. FairGNN [ 9] and FairVGNN [ 54]
enforce the model to generate fair outputs with adversarial training
through the min-max objective. Augmentation-based approaches
generate counterfactual views and minimize the discrepancy with
the original view. NIFTY [ 1] flips sensitive attributes for each
node to obtain the counterfactual view. Message-passing-based
approaches improve fairness through the view of optimization
problem with smoothness regularization. FMP [ 22] proposes a fairmessage-passing framework by considering graph smoothness and
fairness objectives. The post-processing techniques directly cali-
brate the classifier’s decisions at inference time. POSTPROCESS [36]
updates model predictions based on a black-box policy to minimize
differences between demographic groups.
5.2 Re-balancing in Graph Neural Networks
Due to the GNNs inheriting the character of deep neural networks,
GNNs perform with biases toward the majority classes when train-
ing on imbalanced datasets. To overcome this challenge, class-
imbalanced learning on graphs has emerged as a promising solution
that combines the strengths of graph representation learning and
class-imbalanced learning. A great branch of these methods is over-
sampling minority nodes by data augmentation to balance the skew
label distribution. GraphSMOTE [ 59] leverages representative data
augmentation method (i.e., SMOTE [ 16]) and proposes edge pre-
dictor to fuse augmented nodes into the original graph. GraphENS
[39] discovers neighbor memorization phenomenon in imbalanced
node classification, and generates minority nodes by synthesizing
ego-networks according to similarity. GraphSHA [ 28] only synthe-
sizes harder training samples and proposes SEMIMIXUP to block
message propagation from minority nodes to neighbor classes by
generating connected edges from 1-hop subgraphs. Another branch
of class-imbalanced learning on graphs is topology-aware logit
adjustment. TAM [ 47] adjusts margins node-wisely according to
the extent of deviation from connectivity patterns to avoid induc-
ing false positives of minority nodes. Different from the methods
mentioned above that focus on class imbalance, our paper attempts
to address the issue of group imbalance. We emphasize that group
imbalance is a significant source of unfairness in GNNs and, as a
result, design group re-balancing strategies to enhance the fairness
of graph learning.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we provide a new perspective to address the unfair-
ness in graph neural networks. We find that group distribution
imbalance is a significant source of bias and simple re-balancing
methods (e.g., re-weighting and re-sampling) can easily achieve
competitive or even superior performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art fair GNNs. To this end, we propose FairGB which
consists of two modules to automatically balance the contributions
of each group. Guided by theoretical analysis, we conduct linear
interpolation between counterfactual node pairs to effectively mit-
igate bias. In order to further enhance fairness, we propose con-
tribution alignment loss based on gradients and flexibly combine
two modules. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed FairGB in achieving state-of-the-art performance on
three real-world datasets. Future research directions can delve more
into understanding unfairness from a re-balancing perspective and
better integration of the graph properties to mitigate bias.
