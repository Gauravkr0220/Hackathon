Abstract
Spectral Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated superior per-
formance in graph representation learning. However, many current
methods focus on employing shared polynomial coefficients for all
nodes, i.e., learning node-unified filters, which limits the filters’ flex-
ibility for node-level tasks. The recent DSF attempts to overcome
this limitation by learning node-wise coefficients based on posi-
tional encoding. However, the initialization and updating process
of the positional encoding are burdensome, hindering scalability on
large-scale graphs. In this work, we propose a scalable node-wise
filter, PolyAttn. Leveraging the attention mechanism, PolyAttn
can directly learn node-wise filters in an efficient manner, offering
powerful representation capabilities. Building on PolyAttn, we in-
troduce the whole model, named PolyFormer. In the lens of Graph
Transformer models, PolyFormer, which calculates attention scores
within nodes, shows great scalability. Moreover, the model captures
spectral information, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining
efficiency. With these advantages, PolyFormer offers a desirable
balance between scalability and expressiveness for node-level tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods
excel at learning arbitrary node-wise filters, showing superior per-
formance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, and handling
graphs containing up to 100 million nodes. The code is available at

1 Introduction
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool
for addressing a variety of graph-related tasks, including node
classification [ 17,25,41], link prediction [ 49,51], and graph clas-
sification [ 47]. GNNs are generally classified into two categories:
spatial-based and spectral-based [ 18]. Spatial-based GNNs utilize
message passing in the spatial domain for information aggregation,
while spectral-based GNNs employ graph filtering operations in
the spectral domain. Recently, Graph Transformer, a variant of the
Transformer architecture [ 40] adapted for graph data following
its success in natural language processing [ 7,12], computer vision
[10,30], and audio processing [ 8,14], has demonstrated superior
performance in graph representation learning in both spatial and
spectral manners [27, 32, 35, 48].
Spectral GNNs have shown improved performance across vari-
ous graph tasks, especially at the node level [ 4,16,18,19]. These
approaches utilize different polynomial bases to approximate graph
convolution and perform graph filtering on raw node signals. De-
spite their advancements, most models adopt shared polynomial
coefficients for all nodes, leading to node-unified filters. Alterna-
tively, learning specific filters for each node, or node-wise filters,
offers greater flexibility [ 21]. Though efforts of employing differ-
ent filters for different signal channels [ 16,42] have been made,
limitations with node-unified filters persist. A naive approach to
learning node-wise filters involves excessive parameters, such as
different polynomial coefficients for each node, leading to scal-
ability issues. Besides, the learning process lacks generalization
across nodes. To address these challenges, DSF [ 15] has attempted
to employ a shared network on positional encoding, i.e., random
walk positional encoding or Laplacian eigenvectors encoding, to
learn node-wise polynomial coefficients, demonstrating the superi-
ority of node-wise filters over node-unified filters. Nonetheless, the
positional encoding update process is computationally intensive,
with a complexity of 𝑂(𝑁2), and its initialization, like obtaining
Laplacian eigenvectors, also costs expensively with a complexity
of𝑂(𝑁3), where𝑁represents the number of nodes. These hinder
DSF’s scalability for large graphs. Moreover, the performance of
DSF heavily depends on the initial position encoding, presenting
another limitation. This raises the question: Is it possible to design a
scalable and efficient node-wise filter?
In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. We
introduce polynomial attention PolyAttn, an attention-based node-
wise filter. Our approach begins with the formulation of polynomial
node tokens, a concept analogous to tokens in a sentence or patches
 
2118

in an image. Through recursive calculation, these tokens are com-
puted efficiently with complexity 𝑂(𝐾|𝐸|), where𝐾signifies the
truncated order of the polynomial basis which is often small in
practice, and|𝐸|represents the number of edges in the graph. Once
computed, these polynomial tokens can be reused across all train-
ing and inference stages, thereby enhancing efficiency. By applying
attention to the 𝐾+1polynomial tokens associated with each node,
PolyAttn is able to learn node-wise filters in a mini-batch manner
efficiently, resulting in a total complexity of 𝑂((𝐾+1)2𝑁), which
ensures scalability. Additionally, the utilization of shared attention
networks addresses issues related to excessive parameters and lack
of generalization, while still maintaining the flexibility of node-
wise filters. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, we
demonstrate that PolyAttn provides superior expressiveness over
node-unified filters. Building upon this foundation of node-wise
filters, we further develop the whole model PolyFormer.
In the lens of Graph Transformers, PolyFormer is quite dif-
ferent from previous methods. PolyFormer implements attention
on the polynomial tokens of each node, while former Graph Trans-
formers generally calculate attention scores on nodes and then use
the derived node representations for downstream tasks like node
classification or graph regression [ 33,39]. However, it is worth
considering whether it is necessary to implement attention on node
for both node-level and graph-level tasks. In natural language pro-
cessing and computer vision, Transformer-based models mainly
consider the interactions among tokens within a sentence or patches
within an image, respectively, rather than implementing attention
mechanisms between sentences or images [ 7,10,40]. In other words,
these attention mechanisms are typically employed on the sub-units
that constitute the target object, rather than the target object itself.
By capturing the information exchanges among these sub-units,
the attention mechanism derives the representation of the target
object. When it comes to Graph Transformers for node-level tasks,
it is intuitive to develop an attention mechanism on tokens of each
node rather than on nodes. In fact, for Graph Transformers, ap-
plying an attention mechanism on nodes in node-level tasks can
potentially lead to several limitations. Firstly, calculating attention
score on nodes leads to quadratic computational complexity with
respect to the number of nodes [ 40], which poses challenges in
terms of efficiency and scalability. Secondly, attending to all nodes
in the graph neglect the sparse connectivity of the graph, which
is a crucial inductive bias for graph structures. This has a detri-
mental impact on the performance of the Graph Transformer [ 11].
Although various works [ 26,28,43,50] have attempted to address
these limitations through strategies such as sampling, coarsening,
or adopting a more efficient attention mechanism, striking a bal-
ance between scalability and performance (e.g., accuracy) remains
a challenge.
By implementing attention-based node-wise filter PolyAttn on
the proposed polynomial token, PolyFormer offers several ad-
vantages over existing graph transformers. Firstly, it processes
attention within nodes rather than between nodes, enhancing scala-
bility while keeping superior performance. By adopting node tokens
and implementing attention mechanisms on 𝐾+1tokens for each
node instead of focusing on all nodes, the proposed model reduces
computational complexity from 𝑂(𝑁2)to𝑂((𝐾+1)2𝑁), thereby im-
proving scalability. What’s more, PolyFormer supports mini-batchtraining, enhancing scalability further. It’s worth noting that recent
work NAGphormer [ 3] has attempted to represent each node using
information from various hops as units to calculate attention on
these units. However, these units are designed based on the spatial
domain, neglecting the spectral information, which compromises
performance [ 27]. In contrast, with the expressive node-wise filters
PolyAttn, PolyFormer is able to maintain superior performance
on large-scale graphs. Secondly, PolyFormer incorporates spectral
information efficiently and demonstrates exceptional expressive power.
Previous Graph Transformers have highlighted the importance of
spectral information for improving models’ performance [ 2,27,35],
but they rely on eigendecomposition of complexity 𝑂(𝑁3), which
is computationally demanding and memory-intensive. Our model,
however, utilizes spectral information through polynomial approxi-
mation, offering both high expressiveness and efficiency. Extensive
experiments have empirically validated PolyFormer’s performance,
efficiency, and scalability advantages.
We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows:
•We introduce a node-wise filter through a tailored attention
mechanism, termed PolyAttn. By leveraging polynomial-
based node tokens derived from the spectral domain, Poly-
Attn achieves both scalability and expressiveness. Utilizing
these node tokens in conjunction with PolyAttn, we pro-
pose PolyFormer, serving as a scalable and expressive Graph
Transformer for node-level tasks.
•Theoretically, we demonstrate that PolyAttn functions as
a node-wise filter with the designed node token. We also
illustrate that multi-head PolyAttn serves as a multi-channel
filter. Moreover, we explore the computational complexity
tied to the proposed node token, PolyAttn and PolyFormer.
•Comprehensive experiments validate that PolyAttn possesses
greater expressive power than node-unified filters. Build-
ing on PolyAttn, PolyFormer achieves a desirable balance
between expressive power and scalability. It demonstrates
superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic
datasets and is capable of handling graphs with up to 100
million nodes.
2 Background
2.1 Notations
Consider an undirected graph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸), where𝑉is the set of
nodes and𝐸is the set of edges. The adjacency matrix is denoted
asA∈{0,1}𝑁×𝑁, where A𝑖𝑗=1signifies the existence of an edge
between nodes 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗, and𝑁is the total number of nodes in 𝐺.
The degree matrix Dis a diagonal matrix where D𝑖𝑖=Í
𝑗A𝑖𝑗.
The normalized Laplacian of the graph is then defined as ˆL=
I−ˆA=I−D−1/2AD−1/2. In these equations, Irepresents the identity
matrix, ˆAdenotes the normalized adjacency matrix, which is ob-
tained by scaling the adjacency matrix with the degree matrix. It is
well-established that ˆLis a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix,
allowing for decomposition as ˆL=UΛU⊤=Udiag(𝜆0,...,𝜆𝑁−1)U⊤.
Here, Λis a diagonal matrix composed of real eigenvalues 𝜆𝑖∈[0,2],
where𝑖∈{0,...,𝑁−1}, and Uconsists of𝑁corresponding eigen-
vectors that are orthonormal, i.e., U={𝒖0,..., 𝒖𝑁−1}.
Further, we use 𝒙∈R𝑁to denote the graph signal vector and
useX∈R𝑁×𝑑to denote the graph signal matrix or, equivalently,
 
2119PolyFormer: Scalable Node-wise Filters via Polynomial Graph Transformer KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
node feature matrix. The term 𝒚∈R𝑁is used to denote the node
label of the graph. Typically, in a homophilic graph, node labels
between neighbors tend to be the same, whereas in a heterophilic
graph, labels between neighbors tend to be different.
2.2 Graph Filter
Graph filter serves as a crucial concept in the field of graph signal
processing [ 21]. In graph filtering, graph signals are transformed
from the spatial domain to the spectral domain, analogous to how
the Fourier transformation converts signals from the time domain
to the frequency domain. This process allows for filtering signals
on the spectral domain, facilitating the extraction of specific signal
components.
Graph Signal Filtering. Formally, given an original graph sig-
nal𝒙∈R𝑁, the filtered signal 𝒛∈R𝑁is obtained through a graph
filtering operation in the spectral domain, expressed as:
𝒛=Uℎ(Λ)U⊤𝒙. (1)
In the equation above, graph signals 𝒙are first projected into the
spectral domain via the Graph Fourier Transform :ˆ𝒙=U⊤𝒙∈R𝑁,
employing the basis of frequency components U={𝒖0,..., 𝒖𝑁−1}.
Here, ˆ𝒙denotes the frequency response of the original signal on the
basis of frequency components in the spectral domain. The graph fil-
terℎ(·)then modulates the intensity of each frequency component
throughℎ(Λ)U⊤𝒙. Subsequently, the filtered signal is transformed
back into the spatial domain using the Inverse Fourier Transform,
that is, 𝒛=Uℎ(Λ)U⊤𝒙. These processes are also applicable to the
node feature matrix X∈R𝑁×𝑑:
Z=Uℎ(Λ)U⊤X. (2)
It is worth noting that learning graph filters on Λnecessitates Lapla-
cian eigendecomposition , a process that decomposes the Laplacian
matrix in the form of L=UΛU⊤, which has a time complexity
of𝑂(𝑁3). This significantly hinders efficiency and scalability on
large-scale graphs.
Node-wise and Channel-wise Filters. Considering node sig-
nal matrix X∈R𝑁×𝑑, graph filters can be expanded into more
flexible and expressive forms: channel-wise andnode-wise. Specifi-
cally,ℎ(·)is considered channel-wise if there exists a correspond-
ingℎ(𝑗)(·)for each signal channel X:,𝑗, where𝑗∈{0,...,𝑑−1}.
AdaGNN [ 9] learns different filters for each feature channel. Simi-
larly, JacobiConv [ 42] and OptBasisGNN [ 16] also implement multi-
channel filters on their proposed bases. Conversely, graph filters
are node-wise when ℎ(·)is tailored for individual nodes, denoted
asℎ(𝑖)(·)for node𝑣𝑖. DSF [ 15] implements a learnable network on
the positional encoding to derive node-wise polynomial coefficients
and shows enhanced performance of node-wise filters. However,
the high overhead of initializing and updating the positional en-
coding poses a challenge to extending this approach to large-scale
graphs.
Polynomial GNNs. To alleviate the computational burden as-
sociated with eigendecomposition, recent studies have introduced
polynomial GNNs to approximate ℎ(Λ)based on various polyno-
mial bases. ChebNet [ 6] adopts the Chebyshev basis to approximate
the filtering operation, while GCN [ 25] simplifies the ChebNet by
limiting the Chebyshev basis to the first order. GPRGNN [ 4] learns
filters based on the Monomial basis, while BernNet [ 18] utilizes theBernstein basis, providing enhanced interpretability. Furthermore,
ChebNetII [ 19] revisits the Chebyshev basis and constrains the
coefficients through Chebyshev interpolation, showing minimax
polynomial approximation property of truncated Chebyshev expan-
sions. JacobiConv [ 42] further filters based on the family of Jacobi
polynomial bases, with the specific basis determined by hyperpa-
rameters. [ 16] introduces FavardGNN, which employs a learnable
orthonormal basis for a given graph and signal, and OptBasisGNN,
which utilizes an optimal basis with superior convergence proper-
ties.
Generally, using a specific polynomial basis, the approximated
filtering operation can be represented as:
Z=Uℎ(Λ)U⊤X≈𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝛼𝑘𝑔𝑘(P)X, (3)
where𝛼𝑘are the polynomial coefficients for all nodes, 𝑔𝑘(·),𝑘∈
{0,...,𝐾}denotes a series polynomial basis of truncated order 𝐾,
andPrefers to either the normalized adjacency matrix ˆAor the
normalized Laplacian matrix ˆL. For example, the filtering operation
of GPRGNN [ 4] isZ=Í𝐾
𝑘=0𝛼𝑘ˆA𝑘X, which uses the Monomial
basis.
2.3 Transformer
The Transformer architecture [ 40] is a powerful deep learning
model that has shown a significant impact in multiple fields, includ-
ing natural language processing [ 7,12], computer vision [ 10,30,45],
audio applications [8, 14] and even graph learning [33, 39].
Attention Mechanism. The critical component of the Trans-
former is its attention mechanism, which calculates pair-wise in-
teractions between input tokens. Typically, for an input matrix
X=[𝒙1,..., 𝒙𝑛]⊤∈R𝑛×𝑑with𝑛tokens, the attention mecha-
nism transforms Xinto Q,K,Vvia learnable projection matrices
W𝑄∈R𝑑×𝑑′,W𝐾∈R𝑑×𝑑′, and W𝑉∈R𝑑×𝑑′as:
Q=XW𝑄,K=XW𝐾,V=XW𝑉. (4)
The output of the attention mechanism is then computed as:
O=softmaxQK⊤
√
𝑑
V. (5)
This attention mechanism can be executed multiple times to im-
plement a multi-head attention mechanism. It is important to note
that the complexity of the attention mechanism is quadratic with
respect to the input sequence length, denoted as 𝑂(𝑛2𝑑′).
Graph Transformer. The Transformer architecture, adapted
to graph learning and termed Graph Transformers, has garnered
significant attention in recent years [ 33,39]. When adapting Trans-
formers to graph learning, nodes of the graph are typically treated as
input tokens for the model. However, the computational overhead
of the attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with the
number of nodes, restricts the application of Graph Transformers
on large-scale graphs.
Various solutions have been proposed to address the scalability
limitation of Graph Transformers. (1) Adopting Efficient attention
mechanisms enhances scalability. Nodeformer [ 43] employs exist-
ing efficient attention [ 5] with Gumbel-Softmax [ 23] for large-scale
graphs, while SGFormer [ 44] optimizes scalability by substituting
 
2120KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Jiahong Ma, Mingguo He, and Zhewei Wei
softmax attention with proposed linear attention. (2) Node coars-
ening, as another strategy, involves simplifying graph structures.
Coarformer [ 28] employs graph coarsening algorithms [ 31,36] to
obtain coarsened nodes, thereby enabling attention within and
across coarsened and local nodes. GOAT [ 26] utilizes the expo-
nential moving average strategy and K-Means [ 22] to integrate
global information into codebooks and implement attention on
them. Additionally, ANS-GT [ 50] utilizes coarsened nodes for atten-
tion processes. (3) Sampling strategies, such as those employed by
ANS-GT [ 50] with various sampling heuristics (e.g., 1-hop neigh-
bors, Personalized PageRank), reduce the computational demand
by selecting specific nodes for attention calculations. Despite these
approaches, balancing scalability with performance in Graph Trans-
formers remains an ongoing challenge.
3 PolyFormer
In this section, we introduce our proposed node-wise filter PolyAttn
and the whole model PolyFormer, which serves as a scalable and
expressive Graph Transformer. First, we define the concept of node
tokens based on polynomial bases. Utilizing these node tokens,
we describe our attention-based node-wise filter and provide an
overview of the whole model. Finally, we analyze the computational
complexity of our methods and illustrate its relationship with graph
filters.
3.1 Polynomial Token
Analogous to sentence tokenization in natural language processing,
we introduce polynomial tokens.
Definition 3.1. (Polynomial Token) For any node 𝑣𝑖in a
graph𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸), the polynomial token of the node is defined as
𝒉(𝑖)
𝑘=(𝑔𝑘(P)X)𝑖,:∈R𝑑,𝑘∈{0,...,𝐾}, where𝑔𝑘(·)represents a
polynomial basis of order 𝑘,Pis either ˆAorˆL, and Xrepresents the
node features.
In this work, we employ Monomial, Bernstein, Chebyshev, and
the optimal bases for polynomial tokens. These choices offer ease
of implementation compared to some more complex polynomial
bases such as Jacobi basis. Additionally, these bases provide good
properties. the Monomial basis provides a clear spatial interpre-
tation, with 𝒉(𝑖)
𝑘=(ˆA𝑘X)𝑖,:representing the information of the
𝑘-hop neighborhood from node 𝑣𝑖, while the Bernstein basis co-
efficients are highly correlated with the spectral property of the
filer, providing good interpretability. The Chebyshev basis exhibits
excellent fitting capabilities [ 13], while the optimal basis provides
the best converge property [ 16]. Table 1 illustrates the computing
process of polynomial tokens for all nodes in the graph, where
H𝑘=[𝒉(0)
𝑘,..., 𝒉(𝑁−1)
𝑘]⊤∈R𝑁×𝑑denotes the matrix consisting
of polynomial tokens of order 𝑘for𝑘∈{0,...,𝐾}.
The adoption of polynomial tokens presents several distinct
advantages. Firstly, these tokens can be computed efficiently. As
1𝑔0(ˆL)=I,𝑔1(ˆL)=ˆL
2𝑔−1(ˆA)=0,𝑔0(ˆA)=I/||X||. According to [ 16], the optimal bases differs on each
channel of X.𝛾𝑘and𝛽𝑘here, and thus the 𝑘-order output basis, are determined by A
andX:,𝑗specifically.Table 1: Computing process of polynomial tokens for differ-
ent bases.

shown in Table 1, most proposed polynomial tokens can be com-
puted recursively, which is an efficient manner. More detailed com-
plexity analysis is illustrated in 3.3.1. Once computed, they can be
reused across each epoch during both the training and inference
phases, leading to substantial reductions in computational time
and memory usage. Furthermore, by incorporating the normalized
adjacency or Laplacian matrix Pinto the computational process,
graph topology information is integrated into node tokens. This
integration eliminates the necessity for additional positional or
structural encodings, such as Laplacian eigenvectors, thereby en-
hancing the model’s efficiency. Finally, the node-wise independence
of these polynomial tokens allows for mini-batch training, enabling
our model to scale to graphs with up to 100 million nodes.
3.2 PolyAttn and PolyFormer
Given the polynomial tokens associated with each node, Poly-
Former employs an expressive attention-based node-wise filter
PolyAttn to generate node representations. Firstly, we introduce
the proposed attention mechanism PolyAttn, which is tailored for
polynomial tokens and performs as a node-wise filter. Subsequently,
we detail the comprehensive architecture of PolyFormer.
PolyAttn. In this section, we first detail the process of the pro-
posed PolyAttn for a given node 𝑣𝑖. We define the token matrix
H(𝑖)for node𝑣𝑖asH(𝑖)=[𝒉(𝑖)
0,..., 𝒉(𝑖)
𝐾]⊤∈R(𝐾+1)×𝑑. Initially,
the value matrix Vis initialized with the token matrix H(𝑖). Subse-
quently, an order-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP 𝑗) maps the
𝑗-th order token 𝒉(𝑖)
𝑗=H(𝑖)
𝑗,:into a hidden space. This mapping cap-
tures unique contextual information for each order of polynomial
tokens.
Then the query matrix Qand the key matrix Kare obtained by
projecting H(𝑖)through the learnable matrices W𝑄andW𝐾, respec-
tively. These matrices compute the attention scores. Notably, our at-
tention mechanism utilizes the hyperbolic tangent function tanh(·)
rather than the softmax function commonly used in the vanilla
Transformer [ 40]. This modification addresses the limitations of
the softmax function in expressing the capabilities of PolyAttn as a
node-wise graph filter, as detailed in Proposition 3.2. Additionally,
we introduce a node-shared attention bias 𝜷∈R𝐾+1to balance
node-specific and global patterns. The attention scores Sare then
used to update the value matrix V, yielding the final output repre-
sentations. The pseudocode for PolyAttn is outlined in Algorithm 1.
For enhanced expressive power, multi-head PolyAttn is utilized in
practice, with further details available in Appendix C.
PolyFormer. Building upon the attention mechanism designed
for polynomial tokens, we introduce the whole model PolyFormer.
As illustrated in Figure 1, PolyFormer block is described by the
following equations:

tokens are subsequently processed by PolyFormer, which consists of 𝐿blocks. Notably, with the defined polynomial token,
PolyAttn within each block functions as a node-wise filter in the spectral domain, adaptively learning graph filter specific to
each node.

Upon obtaining the token matrix H(𝑖)∈R(𝐾+1)×𝑑for node𝑣𝑖

where𝜎denotes the activation function. The matrices W1∈
R𝑑×𝑑′andW2∈R𝑑′×𝑐are learnable, with 𝑑,𝑑′representing the
hidden dimensions and 𝑐representing the number of node classes.
3.3 Theoretical Analysis
3.3.1 Complexity. Here, we analyze the complexity of computing
polynomial tokens, PolyAttn and PolyFormer.
Computing for Polynomial Tokens. As previously discussed,
the polynomial tokens of Monimial, Chenyshev and the optimal
basis can be calculated recursively. Each iteration for all nodes
involves sparse multiplication with a computational complexity
of𝑂(|𝐸|). Thus, the overall complexity is 𝑂(𝐾|𝐸|), where𝐾is the
truncated order of the polynomial tokens, and |𝐸|is the number
of edges in the graph. It is worth noting that though Bernstein
polynomial tokens are computed in the complexity of 𝑂(𝐾2|𝐸|), it is
still efficient as 𝐾is small in practice. Importantly, these polynomial
tokens can be computed once and reused throughout the training
and inference process.Algorithm 1: Pseudocode for PolyAttn

Complexity of PolyAttn and PolyFormer. Let𝑑denote the
hidden dimension of polynomial tokens, and 𝐾represent the trun-
cated order. In the context of one layer of PolyAttn, each node
involves(𝐾+1)polynomial tokens in attention computation, re-
sulting in a complexity of 𝑂((𝐾+1)2𝑑). With𝑁nodes in the graph
and𝐿layers of attention mechanisms, the total time complexity
is𝑂(𝐿𝑁(𝐾+1)2𝑑). Notably, in practical situations where 𝐾≪𝑁,
this signifies a substantial reduction in computational complexity,

3.3.2 Connection to Spectral Filtering. To understand the connec-
tion between PolyAttn and graph filters, we give the following
theorem and propositions. All proofs are in Appendix B. First, we
formally propose that PolyAttn serves as a node-wise filter for
polynomial tokens.
Theorem 3.1. With polynomial tokens as input, PolyAttn oper-
ates as a node-wise filter. Specifically, for the representation Z𝑖,:=Í𝐾
𝑘=0H′(𝑖)
𝑘,:of node𝑣𝑖after applying PolyAttn:
Z𝑖,:=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0H′(𝑖)
𝑘,:=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝛼(𝑖)
𝑘(𝑔𝑘(P)X)𝑖,:. (9)
Here, the coefficients 𝛼(𝑖)
𝑘depend not only on the polynomial order 𝑘
but also on the specific node 𝑣𝑖. In other words, PolyAttn performs
a node-wise polynomial filter on the graph signals.
Theorem 3.1 builds the bridge between the proposed atten-
tion and node-wise filters. Building on this, we further propose
that the multi-head PolyAttn acts as a multi-channel filter.
Proposition 3.1. A multi-head PolyAttn with ℎheads can be
interpreted as partitioning the node representation into ℎchannel
groups with dimension 𝑑ℎ=𝑑
ℎand applying filtering to each group
separately. Formally:
Z𝑖,𝑝:𝑞=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝛼(𝑖)
(𝑝,𝑞)𝑘(𝑔𝑘(P)X)𝑖,𝑝:𝑞. (10)
Here,𝛼(𝑖)
(𝑝,𝑞)𝑘denotes the coefficient for order 𝑘on channels 𝑝to𝑞of
node𝑣𝑖’s representation, where (𝑝,𝑞)=(𝑗×𝑑ℎ,(𝑗+1)×𝑑ℎ−1),𝑗∈
{0,...,ℎ−1}.
It is worth noting that our chosen activation function, tanh(·),
enables PolyAttn with more powerful expressiveness than the soft-
max function.
Proposition 3.2. For PolyAttn, which operates as a graph filter,
the tanh function endows it with enhanced expressiveness, whereas
the softmax function can limit the expressive capability of PolyAttn.
4 Experiments
In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the proposed PolyAttn and PolyFormer. Specif-
ically, we first evaluate PolyAttn’s ability on node-wise filteringusing both synthetic and real-world datasets. Then, we execute
node classification tasks on both small and large graphs to evaluate
the performance of PolyFormer. We also conduct complexity and
ablation comparison experiments.
4.1 PolyAttn Experiments
4.1.1 Fitting Signals on Synthetic Datasets. In this subsection, we
evaluate the efficacy of PolyAttn as a node-wise filter on synthetic
datasets. This evaluation highlights the enhanced capabilities of
PolyAttn in learning individual filter patterns for each node, without
the need for prior knowledge of predefined filters.
Synthetic Datasets. We use images with a resolution of 100×100
from the Image Processing in Matlab library3. Each image can be
represented as a 2D regular 4-neighborhood grid graph. The pixel
values, ranging from 0to1, serve as node signals. For the 𝑚-th
image, there exists an adjacency matrix A𝑚∈R10000×10000and a
node signal 𝒙𝑚∈R10000. Based on the raw signal of each node,
we apply two hybrid predefined filters to each image, as detailed
in Table 3. Models are expected to learn these predefined filtering
patterns. More details can be seen in Appendix D.1.1.

Setup. We compare PolyAttn with 5 baseline methods, including
GCN [ 25], GAT [ 41], GPRGNN [ 4], BernNet [ 18], and ChebNetII
[19]. To ensure a fair comparison, all models are constrained to one
single layer and have approximately 5k parameters. The learning
rate is uniformly set to 0.001, the training epochs to 50,000, and the
early stopping threshold to 400iterations. We employ two metrics
to evaluate each method: the sum of squared errors and the 𝑅2
score.
Results. As demonstrated in Table 2, PolyAttn outperforms
all baselines on all datasets. Compared to traditional polynomial
GNNs, which employ unified coefficients for all nodes, PolyAttn

uses tailored attention mechanisms for polynomial tokens to en-
able node-wise filtering. This design choice endows PolyAttn with
greater expressive power. Further evidence of this capability is pro-
vided in Figures 2. In the figure, filters learned on each node are
divided into one of two clusters using the 𝑘-means [ 22] algorithm,
and the representative filter (centroid) for each cluster is plotted.
PolyAttn is shown to successfully derive individual filter patterns
without requiring any prior knowledge of predefined filters. This
underscores PolyAttn’s ability to learn graph filters for each node
adaptively.

4.1.2 Performance on Real-world Datasets. We evaluate the efficacy
of PolyAttn as a node-wise filter on real-world datasets.
Setup. For homophilic datasets CS and Pubmed, we employ a
random split: 60% for the training set, 20% for the validation set, and
20% for the test set, following the approach of [ 18]. For heterophilic
graphs Roman-empire and Questions, we adhere to the partitioning
scheme provided in [ 34], allocating 50% of the data for training, 25%
for validation, and 25% for testing. We employ node-unified filters,
which learn shared polynomial coefficients for all nodes, denoted
as “UniFilter”. Correspondingly, we use node-wise filters based on
PolyAttn. All models are configured with a single filtering layer
and the same truncated order to ensure a fair comparison. More
details are listed in Appendix D.1.2.
Results. Table 4 shows the mean accuracies with a 95% confi-
dence interval over 10 runs. We observe that PolyAttn performs
better on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, with especially
notable improvements on the latter one, which suggests the benefits

of its node-wise filtering ability. Further insights are illustrated in
Figures 3, which show the learned filters by “UniFilter (Cheb)” and
“PolyAttn (Cheb)” on Pubmed and Questions. The node-wise filters
learned by PolyAttn are categorized into one of five clusters using
the k-means algorithm [ 22]. Interestingly, we observe that the fil-
ters learned by PolyAttn bear resemblance to the node-unified filter,
yet display a greater level of sophistication. Given that PolyAttn
achieves a relative improvement of up to 4.96% over UniFilter, this
suggests that node-wise filters are essential for enhancing expres-
siveness.

Setup. We employ datasets including four homophilic datasets
[37,38] and six heterophilic datasets [ 34]. For homophilic datasets

the test set, following the approach of [ 18]. For heterophilic graphs,
specifically Minesweeper, Tolokers, Roman-empire, and Questions,
we adhere to the partitioning scheme provided in [ 34], allocating
50% of the data for training, 25% for validation, and 25% for test-
ing. Similarly, for the processed heterophilic datasets Chameleon
and Squirrel, we also utilize the splits specified in [ 34]. As for the
baselines, we select several recent state-of-the-art spectral GNNs
[4,16,18,19], as well as extended node-wise filters [ 15]. Addi-
tionally, our comparison includes competitive Graph Transformer
models [ 2,3,26,43,44]. More details are available in Appendix D.2.1.
Results. As shown in Table 5, our model consistently outper-
forms most baseline models, especially excelling on heterophilic
datasets. Notably, when compared with spectral GNNs such as
ChebNetII, which utilize advanced techniques like Chebyshev In-
terpolation, and node-wise filters like DSF based on additional
positional encoding, our model showcases superior performance.
These results suggest that the introduction of node-wise filters,
PolyAttn, significantly boosts the expressive power of our model.
Furthermore, our model maintains competitive performance against
transformer-based approaches. This observation indicates that fo-
cusing on information within a limited scope, i.e., a truncation of
polynomial basis, provides the necessary expressiveness for achiev-
ing competitive results. Conversely, taking all node pairs into ac-
count may introduce redundant noise that diminishes the model’s
performance.
4.2.2 Node Classifications on Large-scale Datasets. In this subsec-
tion, we extend our model to large-scale datasets, demonstrating thescalability of our model, facilitated by its efficient node tokenization
methods and scalable node-wise filter.
Setup. We perform node classification tasks on two expansive
citation networks: ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-papers100M [ 20], in ad-
dition to two large-scale heterophilic graphs: Twitch-Gamers and
Pokec, sourced from [ 29] to demonstrating the scalability of our
model. For the citation datasets, experiments are conducted using
the given data splits in [ 20]. For the datasets Twitch-gamers and
Pokec, we utilize the five fixed data splits provided in [ 29]. We select
common GNN models, including [ 4,6,25]. For Graph Transformer
models, we use expressive Specformer [ 2], and three scalable base-
lines NAGphormer [ 3], Nodeformer [ 43] and SGFormer [ 44]. More
details are available in Appendix D.2.2.
Results. Table 6 shows the mean accuracy over multiple runs.
Due to our efficient node tokenization techniques and scalable
node-wise filters, PolyFormer exhibits great scalability up to the
graph ogbn-papers100M, which has over 100 million nodes . In
contrast, models such as NAGphormer [ 3] and Specformer [ 2] rely
on Laplacian eigenvectors or eigenvalues, which constrains their
scalability. Moreover, by leveraging expressive PolyAttn, our model
exhibits superior performance.
4.3 Complexity Comparison
In this subsection, we evaluate PolyFormer in comparison to other
attention-based models concerning accuracy, time, and GPU mem-
ory consumption.

Results. As shown in Figure 4, the x-axis represents training
time, and the y-axis represents accuracy, while the area of the circle
indicates the relative maximum GPU memory consumption. Poly-
Former achieves the best performance with low training time and
GPU memory overhead. With the optimal accuracy obtained, the
model possesses slightly more parameters, leading to a marginally
longer training time, which is still acceptable in practice. Addi-
tionally, we record the processing times for several methods: ap-
proximately 1110 seconds for Laplacian eigendecomposition in
Specformer, 40 seconds for truncated Laplacian eigendecomposi-
tion in NAGphormer, and merely 0.36 seconds for calculating poly-
nomial tokens in PolyFormer. Given the significant reduction in
preprocessing time, PolyFormer proves highly efficient in practical
applications. Furthermore, PolyFormer’s capability for mini-batch
training can result in even lower GPU consumption than reported,
thus facilitating scalability to graphs of any size.

tanh activation function with the vanilla attention (self-attention)
mechanism, which uses the softmax activation function. We com-
pare the ability of these two mechanisms to fit the predefined node-
wise filters when given the same polynomial tokens. For example,
SelfAttn (Mono) and PolyAttn (Mono) respectively refer to self-
attention and PolyAttn, with node tokens based on the Monomial
basis. The other experimental settings are consistent with those
described in 4.1.1.
Results. Table 7 presents the results of the ablation experiments,
which show the sum of squared errors in fitting node-wise filters -
where lower values indicate better fitting performance. It is clear
that the proposed PolyAttn that uses the tanh activation function
outperforms the vanilla attention mechanism in accurately fitting
node-wise filters, indicating the validity of our proposed PolyAttn.
5 Conclusion
In this study, we introduce PolyAttn, an attention-based node-wise
filter. PolyAttn utilizes polynomial bases to capture spectral infor-
mation efficiently, outperforming traditional node-unified filters
in expressiveness while maintaining scalability and efficiency. Fur-
thermore, we present PolyFormer, a scalable Graph Transformer
tailored for node-level tasks. PolyFormer strikes a balance between
expressive power and scalability. Extensive empirical evaluations
confirm the superior performance, efficiency, and scalability of
PolyFormer. A promising future direction involves enhancing Poly-
Attn and PolyFormer through the incorporation of more advanced
polynomial approximation and graph spectral techniques.

processed by the order-wise MLP, each row H(𝑖)

H(𝑖)
𝑗,:=MLP𝑗(H(𝑖)
𝑗,:). Subsequently, the query matrix Qand the
key matrix Kare calculated as Q=H(𝑖)W𝑄andK=H(𝑖)W𝐾,
respectively. The attention matrix A𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑛∈R(𝐾+1)×(𝐾+1)is then
formulated as(A𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑛)𝑖𝑗=𝑎𝑖𝑗=(QK⊤)𝑖𝑗.

Here,𝛼(𝑖)

𝑗is computed based
on the node’s token matrix H(𝑖). This value serves as a node-
wise weight for the polynomial filter and is determined by both
the node features and the topology information of the node 𝑣𝑖.
Consequently, the described PolyAttn mechanism functions as a
node-wise filter. □
B.2 Proof of the Propositions
In the following, we present a proof for Proposition 3.1.Proof. For node𝑣𝑖, the multi-head PolyAttn mechanism em-
ploys the sub-channel of the token matrix H(𝑖)
:,𝑗𝑑ℎ:(𝑗+1)𝑑ℎ−1for head
𝑗, where𝑗∈{0,...,ℎ−1}.
According to Theorem 3.1, there exists a set of node-wise coeffi-
cients for node 𝑣𝑖, denoted by 𝛼(𝑖)
(𝑗𝑑ℎ,(𝑗+1)𝑑ℎ−1)𝑘, with𝑘∈{0,...,𝐾}.
These coefficients are computed based on the corresponding sub-
channel of the token matrix H(𝑖)
:,𝑗𝑑ℎ:(𝑗+1)𝑑ℎ−1. The contribution of
head𝑗to the node representation Z𝑖,:can then be formally ex-
pressed as:
Z𝑖,𝑗𝑑ℎ:(𝑗+1)𝑑ℎ−1=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝛼(𝑖)
(𝑗𝑑ℎ,(𝑗+1)𝑑ℎ−1)𝑘(𝑔𝑘(P)X)𝑖,𝑗𝑑ℎ:(𝑗+1)𝑑ℎ−1.
(13)
By concatenating the contributions from all heads, we obtain
the complete node representation for node 𝑣𝑖. Throughout this
procedure, the multi-head PolyAttn mechanism performs a filtering
operation on each channel group separately. □
Below, we deliver a detailed proof for Proposition 3.2.
Proof. According to Proof B.1, when the PolyAttn functions as
a node-wise filter for node 𝑣𝑖, we have:
Z𝑖,:=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0H′(𝑖)
𝑘,:=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝛼(𝑖)
𝑘(𝑔𝑘(P)X)𝑖,:,
where
𝛼(𝑖)
𝑗=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝑠𝑘𝑗=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝜎(𝑎𝑘𝑗)𝛽𝑗,𝑗∈{0,...,𝐾}.
If the softmax function is employed, then for any node 𝑣𝑖in the
graph, the value ofÍ𝐾
𝑘=0𝜎(𝑎𝑘𝑗)remains positive after the softmax
operation. The sign of 𝛼(𝑖)
𝑗is thus determined by the bias 𝛽𝑗. Since
this bias is not node-specific, it implies that the coefficients of all
nodes are constrained by the bias 𝛽𝑗, thereby limiting the expressive
power of PolyAttn when acting as a node-wise filter. For instance,
when all biases 𝛽𝑗are positive, then
𝛼(𝑖)
𝑗=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝑠𝑘𝑗=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0𝜎(𝑎𝑘𝑗)𝛽𝑗>0,
PolyAttn with a Monomial basis can only serve as a low-pass filter
for all nodes [ 4]. In contrast, the activation function tanh(·)allows
the coefficient 𝛼(𝑖)
𝑗=Í𝐾
𝑘=0𝑠𝑘𝑗=Í𝐾
𝑘=0𝜎(𝑎𝑘𝑗)𝛽𝑗to vary across
nodes, enhancing the expressive power of PolyAttn. □
C Implementation Details
Multi-head PolyAttn. Here we provide pseudocode for the multi-
head PolyAttn mechanism as below.
Attention Bias. In implementation, we imposed constraints
on the bias corresponding to each order of polynomial tokens.
Specifically, for the learnable bias 𝜷, the attention bias matrix B∈
R(𝐾+1)×(𝐾+1)is defined as B𝑖𝑗=𝛽𝑗
(𝑗+1)𝑟, where hyperparameter 𝑟
is the constraint factor.
Order-wise MLP. To enhance the expressive capacity of the
order-wise MLP, we use the hyperparameter 𝑚to increase the
intermediate dimension of the order-wise MLP. Specifically, for an

D Experimental Settings
D.1 PolyAttn Experiments
D.1.1 Fitting Signals in Synthetic Datasets. Based on the raw signal
of each node in a graph, we apply one of two predefined filters.
For example, for nodes with signals 𝒙1<0.5, we define a low-
pass filterℎ1(𝜆)=exp(−10𝜆2), resulting in a filtered signal 𝒛1=
Uℎ1(Λ)U⊤𝒙1. Conversely, for nodes with signals 𝒙1≥0.5, we
implement a high-pass filter ℎ2(𝜆)=1−exp(−10𝜆2), yielding the
corresponding filtered signal 𝒛2=Uℎ2(Λ)U⊤𝒙2. For eigenvalues
𝜆∈[0,2], the predefined filters ℎ1(𝜆)andℎ2(𝜆)are shown in Table
3. Given the original graph signals 𝒙1,𝒙2and the filtered graph
signals 𝒛1,𝒛2, Models are expected to learn these filtering patterns.
In this experiment, every model uses a truncated order of 𝐾=10
within one layer. Additionally, We employed one head for PolyAttn.
All models have total parameters of approximately 50,000, achieved
by using an adaptive hidden dimension.
D.1.2 Performance on Real-World Datasets. To ensure a fair com-
parison, the truncated order 𝐾is set to 10for the Monomial, Bern-
stein, and Chebyshev bases, and 5and10for the optimal basis. The
number of layers is set to 1for both the node-unified filter and
PolyAttn. Additionally, the number of heads for PolyAttn is one.
Hyperparameters, including hidden dimensions, learning rates,
and weight-decay rates, are fine-tuned through 200 rounds of Op-
tuna [ 1] hyperparameter search. The best configuration is chosenbased on its performance on the validation set. The final outcomes
are the averages of 10 evaluations on the test set with a 95% confi-
dence interval using the optimal parameters.
The Optuna search space consists of 100 trials, with the searching
space provided below:
•Hidden dimension: {16,32,64,128,256};
•Learning rates:{5e-5, 2e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2 };
•Weight decays:{0.0, 1e-5, 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3 };
•Dropout rates:{0.0,0.1,0.2,..., 0.9};
There is one extra hyperparameter for PolyAttn:
•Multiplying factor 𝑚for order-wise MLP: {1.0, 2.0, 0.5}.
D.2 PolyFormer Experiments
D.2.1 Node Classifications. We train all models with the Adam
optimizer [ 24]. Early stopping is employed with the patience of 250
epochs out of a total of 2000 epochs. The mean test accuracy, along
with a 95% confidence interval, is reported based on 10 runs.
Hyperparameter selection is carried out on the validation sets.
To expedite the hyperparameter selection process, we utilize Op-
tuna [ 1], performing a maximum of 400 complete trials within the
following hyperparameter ranges:
•Truncated order 𝐾of polynomial tokens: {2,4,6,8,10,12,14};
•Number of layers:{1,2,3,4};
•Number of heads:{1,2,4,8,16};
•Hidden dimension: {16,32,64,128,256};
•Hidden size for FFN: {32,64,128,256,512};
•Learning rates:{0.00005,0.0001,0.0005,0.001,0.005,0.01};
•Weight decays:{0.0, 1e-8, 1e-7, 1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3 };
•Dropout rates:{0.0,0.1,0.2,..., 0.9};
•Constraint factor 𝑟:{1.0,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8,2.0};
•Multiplying factor 𝑚for order-wise MLP : {1.0,2.0,0.5}.
D.2.2 Node Classifications on Large-Scale Datasets. The reported
results for GNNs are sourced from He et al . [19] , whereas some
results for the Graph Transformer are sourced from Wu et al . [44] .
The remaining results are derived from recommended hyperparam-
eters or through hyperparameter searching. The mean test accuracy,
accompanied by a 95% confidence interval, is reported based on
either 5 or 10 runs.
We utilize the Adam optimizer [ 24] to train our models. Early
stopping is implemented with patience at 250 epochs within an
overall training span of 2000 epochs. The hyperparameter space
used for experiments on large-scale datasets is enumerated below:
•Truncated order 𝐾of polynomial tokens: {4,8,10};
•Number of layers:{1,2};
•Number of heads:{1,4,8};
•Hidden dimension: {128,512,1024};
•Hidden size for FFN: {512,1024};
•Learning rates:{0.00005,0.0002,0.01};
•Weight decays:{0.0,0.00005,0.0005,0.001};
•Dropout rates:{0.0,0.25,0.4,0.5};
•Constraint factor 𝑟:{1.0,2.0};
•Multiplying factor 𝑚for order-wise MLP: {0.5,1.0};
•Batch size:{10000,20000,50000}.
