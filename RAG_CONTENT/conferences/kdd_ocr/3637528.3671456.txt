ABSTRACT
Graph plays a significant role in representing and analyzing com-
plex relationships in real-world applications such as citation net-
works, social networks, and biological data. Graph intelligence is
rapidly becoming a crucial aspect of understanding and exploit-
ing the intricate interconnections within graph data. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) and prompt learning techniques
have pushed graph intelligence forward, outperforming traditional
Graph Neural Network (GNN) pre-training methods and setting
new benchmarks for performance. In this tutorial, we begin by offer-
ing a comprehensive review and analysis of existing methods that
integrate LLMs with graphs. We introduce existing works based
on a novel taxonomy that classifies them into three distinct cate-
gories according to the roles of LLMs in graph tasks: as enhancers,
predictors, or alignment components. Secondly, we introduce a
new learning method that utilizes prompting on graphs, offering
substantial potential to enhance graph transfer capabilities across
diverse tasks and domains. We discuss existing works on graph
prompting within a unified framework and introduce our developed
tool for executing a variety of graph prompting tasks. Addition-
ally, we discuss the applications of combining Graphs, LLMs, and
prompt learning across various tasks, such as urban computing, rec-
ommendation systems, and anomaly detection. This lecture-style
tutorial is an extension of our original work published in

1 INTRODUCTION
Graph theory, or simply graph, is integral to many sectors today, no-
tably in fields like technology, science, and logistics [ 37]. It involves
representing data as nodes and edges to highlight the relationships
and structural linkages among the elements within a graph. Diverse
datasets inherently structured as graphs include citation networks
[66], social networks [ 30], and molecular structures [ 91]. For pro-
cessing and analyzing these graph-based datasets, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) [ 41,85] have become increasingly prevalent. The
primary function of GNNs is to develop powerful representations
at the node, edge, or overall graph level, facilitating various ap-
plied tasks by utilizing recursive node-based message passing and
aggregation techniques.
Over recent years, there have been notable developments in
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Transformers [ 84], BERT
[40], GPT [ 3], and their various iterations. These models have
shown exceptional adaptability and effectiveness in handling nu-
merous natural language processing applications, including senti-
ment analysis, machine translation, text categorization [ 105], and
entity linking [ 45,68]. Initially focused on textual data, there is an
increasing exploration into broadening the applicability of LLMs to
manage different data formats, such as graphs, images, and videos,
enhancing their multi-modal functionality.
Enhancing Graph Tasks with LLMs. The utilization of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the interaction with
graph data, especially for graphs with text-related node attributes.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the convergence of LLMs and graph
technology has proven effective for a range of applications within
various graph-based domains. The synergy between LLMs and
traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offers reciprocal bene-
fits and augments the capabilities of graph analytics. GNNs excel
in processing structural data but often utilize node features that
are semantically limited, constraining their ability to fully articu-
late the complexities inherent in the nodes. By integrating LLMs,
GNNs gain access to enriched node features that encapsulate both
the structural and contextual dimensions more effectively. Con-
versely, while LLMs are adept at processing textual information,

they typically lack the capability to analyze the structural data
intrinsic to graphs. By combining LLMs with GNNs, the strengths
of LLMs in textual comprehension can be harmonized with the
structural analytical prowess of GNNs, resulting in enhanced graph
learning capabilities. Following the framework proposed in [ 9], we
organize a detailed first-level taxonomy that classifies the roles
of LLMs—such as enhancers, predictors, and aligners—within the
overall model architecture, introducing greater specificity to the
initial categorizations.
Graph Prompts help graph tasks. Recently, some researchers
have started to introduce prompt learning to graph data [ 7,21,26,
29,55,56,73,74,107]. However, some further studies have found
that the graph prompt is very different from their counterparts
in the NLP area [ 74]. First, the design of graph prompts proves
to be a far more intricate endeavor compared to the formulation
of language prompts. Classic language prompts often comprise
predefined phrases or learnable vectors appended to input text
[3,24]. Here, the primary focus lies in the content of the language
prompt. However, we actually do not know what a graph prompt
looks like. A graph prompt not only contains the prompt "content"
but also includes the undefined task of determining how to struc-
ture these prompt tokens and seamlessly integrate them into the
original graph. Second, the harmonization of downstream graph
problems with the pre-training task is more difficult than language
tasks [ 55,74]. For example, a typical pre-training approach for a
language model is to predict a masked word by the model [ 16].
Then many downstream tasks such as question answering, and sen-
timent classification can be easily reformulated as word-level tasks
[51]. Unlike NLP, where pre-training tasks often share a substantial
task sub-space, graph tasks span node-level [ 27], edge-level [ 100],
and graph-level objectives [ 72,76], making pre-training pretexts
less adaptable. Third, compared with prompts in NLP which are
usually some understandable phrases, graph prompts are usually
less intuitive to non-specialists. The fundamental nature and role
that graph prompts play within the graph model remain somewhat
elusive without comprehensive theoretical analysis. There is also
a lack of clear-cut evaluation criteria for the quality of designed
graph prompts. In addition, there are still many unclear questions
for us to further understand graph prompting. For example, how
effective are these graph prompts? What is their efficiency in terms

of parameter complexity and training burden? How powerful and
flexible do these prompts manipulate the original graph data? In
light of these intricacies questions, there is a pressing need for
delving deeper into the potential of graph prompts in AGI, thereby
paving the way for a more profound understanding of this evolving
frontier within the broader data science landscape.
2 PRELIMINARY
In this section, we begin by outlining the fundamental concepts of
two critical areas pertinent to our survey: Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Following this, we
provide a concise overview of the newly developed taxonomy.
2.1 Graph Neural Networks
Core Concepts. The majority of current Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) employ a message-passing framework, which encompasses
both message aggregation and feature updates, as seen in models
like GCN [ 41] and GAT [ 85]. These networks construct represen-
tations of nodes through a process of iteratively gathering and
updating neighbor information using non-linear transformations.
The forward propagation in these networks can be described by
the following equation:
ℎ(𝑙)
𝑖=U
ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑖,M(ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑖,ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑗|𝑣𝑗∈N𝑖)
Here,ℎ(𝑙)
𝑖represents the feature vector of node 𝑖at layer𝑙, andN𝑖
represents the set of neighboring nodes around node 𝑖. The function
Mis the message-passing function that aggregates information from
these neighbors, while Uis the update function that integrates the
features of the central node with those of its neighbors. By layering
these processes, GNNs are capable of incorporating messages from
extended neighbor networks.
Graph pre-training and prompting. While GNNs have achieved
some success in graph machine learning, they require expensive
annotations and barely generalize to unseen data. To remedy these
deficiencies, graph pre-training aims to extract some general knowl-
edge for the graph models to easily deal with different tasks without
significant annotation cost. The current mainstream graph per-
taining methods can be divided into contrastive and generative
6546Graph Intelligence with Large Language Models and Prompt Learning KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
approaches. For instance, GraphCL [ 97] and GCA [ 109] follow a
contrastive learning framework and maximize the agreement be-
tween two augmented views. [ 75] extend the contrastive idea to
hypergraphs. GraphMAE [ 32], S2GAE [ 78], and WGDN [ 11] mask
the component of the graph and attempt to reconstruct the original
data. The typical learning scheme of “pre-training and fine-tuning”
is based on the assumption that the pre-training task and down-
stream tasks share some common intrinsic task space. Instead, in
the NLP area, researchers gradually focus on a new paradigm of
“pre-training, prompting, and fine-tuning”, which aims to reformu-
late input data to fit the pretext. This idea has also been naturally
applied to the graph learning area. GPPT [ 73] first pre-trains graph
model by masked edge prediction, then modify the standalone node
into a token pair and reformulate the downstream classification
as edge prediction task. Additionally, All in One [ 74] proposes a
multi-task prompting framework, which unifies the format of graph
prompts and language prompts.
2.2 Large Language Models
Definitions. Although a precise definition for Large Language
Models (LLMs) remains elusive [ 67], this survey offers a specific de-
lineation for LLMs as mentioned in our discussion. Key distinctions
between LLMs and pre-trained language models (PLMs) are drawn
based on model size and training methodology, as highlighted in
influential surveys [ 94,105]. Specifically, LLMs refer to colossal
models (i.e., those with billions of parameters) that undergo ex-
tensive pre-training on vast datasets. In contrast, PLMs are earlier
models with relatively moderate parameter counts (i.e., millions),
designed for efficient fine-tuning on specific tasks to enhance per-
formance on downstream applications. Considering the typically
smaller parameter size of GNNs and their integration needs, we
align with the broader definition from [ 49], which encompasses
both LLMs and PLMs as previously defined.
Evolution. Large Language Models can be broadly categorized
into non-autoregressive and autoregressive models based on their
approach to language modeling. Non-autoregressive LLMs typi-
cally focus on natural language understanding, utilizing "masked
language modeling" during their pre-training phase. Examples of
such models include BERT [ 40], SciBERT [ 1], and RoBERTa [ 53].
On the other hand, autoregressive LLMs are geared towards natural
language generation, often employing a "next token prediction"
task for foundational training. Recent developments in this category
include models like Flan-T5 [ 14] and ChatGLM [ 99], which utilize
encoder-decoder structures, and models like GPT-3 [ 3], PaLM [ 13],
Galactica [82], and LLaMA [83], which are based on decoder-only
architectures. These advancements in architecture and training
methods have enabled LLMs to exhibit emergent capabilities, such
as performing complex tasks in few-shot or zero-shot settings,
facilitated by techniques like in-context learning [ 17,63] and chain-
of-thought reasoning [88].
2.3 Proposed Taxonomy
We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes methods that merge
graph and text modalities into three primary categories: (1)LLM
as Enhancer, where LLMs are deployed to boost the classification
effectiveness of GNNs; (2)LLM as Predictor, where LLMs leverage

graph structural data to perform predictions; and (3)GNN-LLM
Alignment, where LLMs provide semantic enhancements to GNNs
through various alignment methods. It’s important to note that
some models scarcely involve LLMs, making them challenging to
classify within these main categories. These exceptions are grouped
under an "Others" category. For instance, in LLM-GNN [ 10], the
LLM serves as an annotator, selecting nodes for ChatGPT to la-
bel, thereby enriching GNN training. GPT4GNAS [ 87] views the
LLM as a knowledgeable controller in the domain of graph neu-
ral architecture search, employing GPT-4 [ 60] to probe the design
landscape and forge new GNN frameworks. Moreover, ENG [ 98]
utilizes the LLM as a sample generator, creating additional labeled
training instances to ensure ample supervisory signals for GNNs.
In the sections that follow, we will delve into a thorough survey of
each primary category in our taxonomy, discussing the integration
of LLMs into graph-centric tasks.
3 INFERENCE FROM PRE-TRAINED MODEL
VIA LLMS
3.1 LLM as Enhancer
GNNs have emerged as effective instruments for analyzing data
with graph structures. Yet, predominant benchmark datasets such
as Cora and Ogbn-Arxiv utilize elementary techniques for encoding
text in text-attributed graphs (TAGs), relying on basic embeddings
like bag-of-words, skip-gram [ 58], or TF-IDF [ 65]. This simplistic
approach can limit the effectiveness of GNNs when applied to TAGs.
The LLM-as-enhancer strategy aims to elevate the quality of node
embeddings by leveraging the capabilities of advanced LLMs. These
enhanced embeddings are then integrated into the graph structure
for use by GNNs or directly fed into downstream classifiers for a
variety of tasks. We classify these methods into two main types:
explanation-based and embedding-based, based on whether the
LLMs are employed to generate additional textual content.
3.1.1 Explanation-based Enhancement. Methods that utilize expla-
nation enhancement to improve textual attributes take advantage
of the powerful zero-shot abilities of LLMs to grasp more intricate
information. Illustrated in Figure 3(a), these techniques generally
6547KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Jia Li, Xiangguo Sun, Yuhan Li, Zhixun Li, Hong Cheng, and Jeffrey Xu Yu
involve using LLMs to generate additional, semantically dense data
such as explanations, knowledge entities, and pseudo labels.
For instance, TAPE [ 31] is a pioneer in using explanation-based
enhancement, employing LLMs to generate explanations and pseudo
labels that augment the textual features. These enriched outputs
are then utilized to fine-tune smaller language models, which in
turn create initial node embeddings that incorporate rich semantic
details. Chen et al . [9] explore the applications of LLMs in graph
learning, starting with a comparison of LLMs with visibility to em-
beddings against traditional shallow embedding methods before
presenting KEA. KEA utilizes LLMs to generate a set of knowledge
entities with related text descriptions, which are encoded using
fine-tuned PLMs and sophisticated sentence embedding techniques.
LLM4Mol [ 61] investigates how LLMs can be used to predict molec-
ular properties, specifically by generating detailed explanations for
original SMILES strings, and then fine-tuning a smaller language
model for use in downstream tasks. LLMRec [ 89] aims to tackle
the issues of data sparsity and quality in graph-based recommen-
dation systems by enhancing the edges of user-item interactions
and generating supplementary information for users and items
through LLMs, followed by using a streamlined GNN to process
the enhanced recommendation network.
3.1.2 Embedding-based Enhancement. Embedding-based enhance-
ment methods directly employ LLMs to generate text embeddings
that are used as initial node embeddings in GNN training. This
approach demands the utilization of embedding-visible or open-
source LLMs, as it requires direct access to text embeddings or
the ability to fine-tune LLMs incorporating structural data. How-
ever, many leading-edge LLMs such as GPT4 [ 60] and PaLM [ 13]
are proprietary and only available through online platforms, with
strict controls that limit researchers’ access to their internal pa-
rameters and embeddings. Typically, embedding-based methods
use a sequential approach that leverages structural data during the
pre-training or fine-tuning of language models.
For instance, G ALM [ 92] pre-trains PLMs alongside a GNN aggre-
gator using a vast graph corpus to optimize the capture of useful in-
formation for broad applications, then refines the system on specific
downstream tasks to boost performance. Other studies like GIANT
[12], SimTeG [ 18], and TouchUp-G [ 106] incorporate structural
data in the fine-tuning phase of LLMs to generate node embeddings.
While GIANT utilizes the XR-Transformer to address extreme multi-
label classification rather than link prediction, TouchUp-G applies
negative sampling in link prediction, and SimTeG uses parameter-
efficient techniques to speed up fine-tuning. Additionally, G-Prompt
[36] integrates a graph adapter into PLMs to extract graph-aware
node features, using task-specific prompts post-training to pro-
duce interpretable node representations for various applications.
WalkLM [ 79] is an unsupervised method for learning generic graph
representations that initially generates attributed random walks on
graphs, subsequently creating textual sequences through an auto-
mated textualization program before fine-tuning an LLM to derive
representations. METERN [ 38] incorporates relation-specific prior
tokens to capture relevant signals, employing a single language
encoder to model shared knowledge across relations. LEADING
[93] efficiently fine-tunes LLMs and transfers risk knowledge to

downstream GNN models with reduced computational and memory
demands.
A novel approach, OFA [ 48], proposes a versatile graph learn-
ing framework capable of using a unified graph model for adap-
tive downstream predictions. It describes all nodes and edges in
human-readable text and encodes them across different domains
using LLMs, adapting to various tasks by integrating task-specific
prompts into the graph input. ZeroG [ 46] leverages a language
model to encode node attributes and class descriptions, employ-
ing prompt-based subgraph sampling and lightweight fine-tuning
strategies to address cross-dataset zero-shot transferability chal-
lenges in graph learning.
3.2 LLM as Predictor
The core idea behind this category is to utilize LLMs to make predic-
tions for a wide range of graph-related tasks, such as classifications
and reasonings, within a unified generative paradigm. However,
applying LLMs to graph modalities presents unique challenges,
primarily because graph data often lacks straightforward transfor-
mation into sequential text, as different graphs define structures
and features in different ways. We classify the models broadly into
flatten-based and GNN-based predictions, depending on whether
they employ GNNs to extract structural features for LLMs.
3.2.1 Flatten-based Prediction. The majority of the existing at-
tempts that utilize LLMs as predictors employ the strategy of flat-
tening the graph into textual descriptions, which facilitates direct
processing of graph data by LLMs through text sequences. As shown
in Figure 4(a), flatten-based prediction typically involves two steps:
(1)utilizing a flatten function to transform a graph structure into
a sequence of nodes or tokens, and (2)a parsing function is then
applied to retrieve the predicted label from the output generated by
LLMs. As the core of flatten-based prediction, a variety of flatten
functions has been leveraged.
GPT4Graph [ 28] utilizes graph description languages such as
GML and GraphML to represent graphs. These languages provide
standardized syntax and semantics for representing the nodes and
edges within a graph. Inspired by linguistic syntax trees, GraphText
[104] leverages graph-syntax trees to convert a graph structure to
a sequence of nodes, which is then fed to LLMs for training-free
graph reasoning. Furthermore, ReLM [ 69] uses SMILES strings to

provide one-dimensional linearizations of molecular graph struc-
tures. GIMLET [ 102] adopts distance-based position embedding to
extend the capability of LLMs to perceive graph structures. Graph
data can be also represented through methods like adjacency matri-
ces and adjacency lists. Several methods [ 8,22,47,86,101] directly
employ numerically organized node and edge lists to depict the
graph data in plain text. GraphTMI [ 15] further explores different
modalities such as motif and image to integrate graph data with
LLMs.
The use of natural narration to express graph structures is also
making steady progress. [ 9] and [ 33] both integrate the structural in-
formation of citation networks into the prompts, which is achieved
by explicitly representing the edge relationship through the word
“cite” and representing the nodes using paper indexes or titles. [ 34],
on the other hand, does not use the word “cite” to represent edges
but instead describes the relationships via enumerating randomly
selected𝑘-hop neighbors of the current node. Similarly, Instruct-
GLM [ 96] designs a series of scalable prompts based on the max-
imum hop level. These prompts allow a central paper node to es-
tablish direct associations with its neighbors up to any desired
hop level by utilizing the described connectivity relationships ex-
pressed in natural language. In addition, GPT4Graph [ 28] and [ 9]
imitate the aggregation behavior of GNNs and summarize the cur-
rent neighbor’s attributes as additional inputs, aiming to provide
more structural information.
3.2.2 GNN-based Prediction. GNNs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding graph structures through recursive in-
formation exchange and aggregation among nodes. As illustrated in
Figure 4(b), in contrast to flatten-based prediction, which converts
graph data into textual descriptions as inputs to LLMs, GNN-based
prediction leverages the advantages of GNNs to incorporate inher-
ent structural characteristics and dependencies present in graph
data with LLMs, allowing LLMs to be structure-aware. GNN-based
prediction also relies on a parser to extract the output from LLMs.
Integrating GNN representations into LLMs often requires tuning,
making it easier to standardize the prediction format of LLMs by
providing desirable outputs during training.
Various strategies have been proposed to fuse the structural pat-
terns learned by GNNs and the contextual information captured by
LLMs. For instance, GIT-Mol [ 50] and MolCA [ 54] both implement
BLIP-2’s Q-Former [ 42] as the cross-modal projector to map the
graph encoder’s output to the LLM’s input text space. Multiple
objectives with different attention masking strategies are employed
for effective graph-text interactions. GraphLLM [ 5] derives thegraph-enhanced prefix by applying a linear projection to the graph
representation during prefix tuning, allowing the LLM to synergize
with the graph transformer to incorporate structural information
crucial to graph reasoning. Additionally, both GraphGPT [ 81] and
InstructMol [ 4] employ a simple linear layer as the lightweight
alignment projector to map the encoded graph representation to
some graph tokens, while the LLM excels at aligning these tokens
with diverse text information. DGTL [ 62] injects the disentangled
graph embeddings directly into each layer of the LLM, highlighting
different aspects of the graph’s topology and semantics.
3.3 GNN-LLM Alignment
The integration of GNNs with LLMs provides an effective strategy
for merging graph and textual data. This approach maintains the
unique strengths of each model by aligning their embedding spaces
at a specific juncture. Alignment methods can be classified into two
types: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric alignment considers
GNNs and LLMs on equal footing, while asymmetric alignment
gives precedence to one model over the other.
3.3.1 Symmetric. Symmetric alignment treats graph and text data
equally during the process of alignment, ensuring that the encoding
systems for each modality perform well in their respective uses.
The architecture of symmetric alignment, depicted in Figure 5(a),
typically features a dual-tower design, with distinct encoders for
graph and text data processing. These modalities only interact
once in the alignment process. Traditional methods such as SAFER
[6] often employ straightforward concatenation to merge these
embeddings.
Recent advancements in dual-tower architectures have embraced
contrastive learning techniques, following models such as CLIP [ 63],
to enhance the alignment of different data types. This process usu-
ally involves first extracting representations from both graphs and
texts, which are then aligned using a modified InfoNCE loss [ 59].
Text2Mol [ 19] implements a cross-modal attention mechanism that
facilitates the early integration of graph and text embeddings. It uti-
lizes a transformer decoder that processes the output from an LLM
as the source sequence and from a GNN as the target sequence,
which are then used in contrastive learning with GNN outputs.
Models like MoMu [ 71], MoleculeSTM [ 52], ConGraT [ 2], and RLM-
Rec [ 64] follow a similar approach, aligning paired graph and text
embeddings using contrastive learning. MoMu and MoleculeSTM,
sourcing molecules from PubChem, pair these with texts from sci-
entific articles and molecule descriptions, respectively. ConGraT
6549KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Jia Li, Xiangguo Sun, Yuhan Li, Zhixun Li, Hong Cheng, and Jeffrey Xu Yu
expands this pairing method to include social, knowledge, and ci-
tation networks, while RLMRec integrates semantic spaces from
LLMs with interaction signals in recommendation systems through
contrastive learning. Further refinements in contrastive learning
are seen in G2P2 [90] and GRENADE [43], where G2P2 applies con-
trastive learning at multiple levels—node-text, text-text summary,
and node-node summary—during pre-training, and uses prompts
for downstream tasks. G RENADE enhances alignment by incorpo-
rating graph-centric dual-level knowledge alignment, focusing on
both individual nodes and their neighborhoods.
Iterative alignment, illustrated in Figure 5(b), offers a unique
approach by enabling ongoing interactions between modalities.
For instance, GLEM [ 103] uses an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
framework, where encoders iteratively generate pseudo-labels for
each other, continually refining the alignment of the two represen-
tation spaces.
3.3.2 Asymmetric. Symmetric alignment equally considers both
modalities, while asymmetric alignment gives precedence to one,
often using GNNs to enhance LLMs through structural processing.
Prominent techniques in this area include graph-nested transform-
ers and graph-aware distillation.
The graph-nested transformer, highlighted by Graphformer [ 95]
in Figure 5(c), showcases asymmetric alignment by embedding
GNN capabilities into each transformer layer. In this setup, the node
embeddings are derived from the initial token-level embeddings,
specifically from the [ CLS] token. The method involves aggregating
embeddings from pertinent nodes and processing them through a
graph transformer. The resulting output is merged with the initial
embeddings and forwarded to the subsequent transformer layer.
Patton [ 39] builds on this by introducing network-contextualized
masked language modeling and masked node prediction, achiev-
ing notable results in various applications such as classification,
retrieval, reranking, and link prediction.
GRAD [57] utilizes graph-aware distillation to align both modal-
ities, as illustrated in Figure 5(d). This approach uses a GNN as
a teacher model to create soft labels that train an LLM. As the
LLMs share parameters, updates to these parameters also benefit
the GNN by refining its text encodings. Through repeated updates, a
graph-informed LLM is developed, which offers increased inference
scalability due to the elimination of the GNN in the final model.
Similarly, THLM [ 110] uses a heterogeneous GNN to augment LLMs
with advanced topology learning capabilities. This method involves
co-training an LLM and an auxiliary GNN through Context Graph
Prediction and Masked Language Modeling tasks. After the co-
training phase, the auxiliary GNN is removed, allowing the refined
LLM to be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.
4 INFERENCE FROM PRE-TRAINED MODEL
VIA GRAPH PROMPT
In this section, we introduce a comprehensive framework for graph
prompt design. As depicted in Figure 6, a graph prompt comprises
three essential components: prompt tokens with an associated vec-
tor; token structures that preserve the intrinsic correlations among
tokens; and insertion patterns for integrating the original graph
with prompts. This framework prompts several pivotal inquiries:

are downstream tasks redefined to align with pre-training tasks?
Question 3: What methods are effective for prompt learning? With
these questions, we summarize the most representative works pub-
lished recently and present them in Table 2.
4.1 Design Aspects of Graph Prompts
Question 1: How are Graph Prompts Designed?
A. Prompt Representation as Tokens. The fundamental con-
cept of a graph prompt entails augmenting the original graph fea-
tures with additional attributes [ 108]. For instance, consider a graph
feature matrix X={𝑥1,···,𝑥𝑁}∈R𝑁×𝑑, where𝑥𝑖∈R1×𝑑rep-
resents the 𝑖-th node’s feature, and 𝑑signifies the feature space
dimension. Studies such as Fang et al . [20] and Shirkavand and
Huang [70] conceptualize the basic prompt as a learnable vector
𝑝∈R1×𝑑, which, when added to each node feature, transforms
the feature matrix to X∗={𝑥1+𝑝,···,𝑥𝑁+𝑝}. This restructured
feature matrix facilitates the utilization of pre-trained graph models
for processing the graph. Subsequent research [ 21] has extended
this concept to multiple tokens, enhancing performance. Various
approaches, including PGCL [ 26] and VNT [ 80], have introduced
distinct prompt vectors for semantic and contextual interpretations,
applying them to graph-level representations through element-wise
multiplication. Differently, GraphPrompt [ 55] employs prompt to-
kens at the model’s hidden layers, optimizing for graph pooling
operations, thus differing in prompt token dimensionality and ap-
plication.
B. Prompt Representation as Graphs. Innovative approaches
such as All in One [ 74] conceptualize the graph prompt as an ad-
ditional learnable subgraph, incorporating nodes that parallel the
original nodes in representation size and semantic space. This de-
sign facilitates direct manipulation of node features through prompt
tokens. The structural design of prompts encompasses both intra-
token links and cross-links between the prompt and original graphs,
allowing for seamless integration and processing as a unified graph
within pre-trained models.

4.2 Task Alignment via Answering Mechanisms
Question 2: Reformulation of Downstream Tasks to Pretexts.
A. Addressing Diverse Task Levels. All in One [ 74] demon-
strates a method to adapt the graph model for graph-level con-
trastive learning, aiming to unify node-level, edge-level, and graph-
level tasks via induced subgraphs. This approach posits that the
addition of a graph prompt inherently simulates various graph ma-
nipulations, thereby enabling the straightforward reformulation of
downstream tasks.
B. Learnable Answering Mechanisms. Adaptable task heads
[74], such as MLPs, facilitate the output of downstream task results
by leveraging graph-level representations from pre-trained models.
This versatility allows for minimal data requirements during tuning,
promoting ease of alignment between tasks [20, 21, 80].
C. Predefined Answering Mechanisms. To minimize tuning
complexity, strategies such as predefined non-trainable answeringfunctions have been proposed. These functions categorize nodes by
aligning them with specific prompts corresponding to node types,
leveraging pre-trained models for direct classification without ad-
ditional trainable components [25, 35, 56, 73].
4.3 Efficient Learning of Graph Prompts
Question 3: Optimizing Graph Prompt Learning.
A. Application of Meta-Learning. To ascertain optimal prompt
parameters, techniques from meta-learning, specifically the Model-
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework [ 23], are employed.
This approach facilitates the derivation of prompts that exhibit
generalizability across a diverse array of graph-based tasks, thereby
enhancing their versatility and effectiveness.
B. Task-specific Fine-tuning. While studies such as All in One
[74] aim for general applicability across tasks, others focus on opti-
mizing prompts for specific challenges, such as graph classification.

This targeted approach allows for the precise tuning of prompts
and associated task heads, ensuring maximum performance for
given objectives. For instance, GPF [ 20] optimizes its methodology
specifically for graph classification tasks, aligning the tuning of
prompt tokens and task heads with the goal of enhancing prediction
accuracy.
C. Alignment with Pretext Tasks. Prompt tuning that is coher-
ent with the objectives of pretext tasks offers a natural and effective
strategy for learning. By adopting loss functions and learning ob-
jectives that mirror those used in pre-training, approaches such as
GraphPrompt [ 55] and GPPT [ 73] ensure that the adaptation and
integration of prompts are intrinsically aligned with the underlying
models’ capabilities and training paradigms.5 CONCLUSION
The application of LLMs and graph prompts to graph tasks has
emerged as a prominent area of research in recent years. In this
survey, we aim to provide an in-depth overview of existing strate-
gies for adapting LLMs and graph prompts to graphs. Firstly, we
introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing techniques
based on the different roles played by LLMs. Secondly, we systemat-
ically review the representative studies according to the taxonomy.
Thirdly, by exploring the interplay between graph prompts and
models, we’ve revealed fresh insights into the essence of graph
prompts, highlighting their pivotal role in reshaping AI for graph
data. Through this comprehensive review, we aspire to shed light
on the advancements and challenges in the field of graph learning

and applications in graph intelligence.
