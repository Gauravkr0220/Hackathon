ABSTRACT
This paper introduces FedSecurity, an end-to-end benchmark that
serves as a supplementary component of the FedML library for
simulating adversarial attacks and corresponding defense mecha-
nisms in Federated Learning (FL). FedSecurity eliminates the need
for implementing the fundamental FL procedures, e.g., FL training
and data loading, from scratch, thus enables users to focus on devel-
oping their own attack and defense strategies. It contains two key
components, including FedAttacker that conducts attacks during FL
training, and FedDefender that implements defensive mechanisms
to counteract these attacks. FedSecurity has the following features:
i) It offers extensive customization options to accommodate a broad

1 INTRODUCTION
Federated Learning (FL) [ 69] facilitates training across distributed
data and enable clients to utilize their local data to train machine
learning models collaboratively. Instead of collecting data to a cen-
tralized server, FL clients train models on their local data and share
the local models with the FL server, and the FL server then ag-
gregates the local models into a global model. FL has attracted
considerable attention across various domains and has been uti-
lized in numerous areas such as next-word prediction [ 16,36,79],
hot-word detection [ 56], financial risk assessment [ 12], and cancer
risk prediction [18], etc.
Recently, FL applications are expanded with large language mod-
els (LLMs), i.e.,federated LLMs [14]. Currently, there are industry
products that utilize FL (or distributed training) to train LLMs, such
as Deepspeed ZeRO [ 77,94], HuggingFace Accelerate [ 34], Pytorch
Lightning Fabric [ 2], and FedLLM [ 24]. FL facilitates LLM training
due to the following reasons: i)Distributed nature of LLM train-
ing data: LLMs are pre-trained using large amounts of data that
often reside in different locations. Collecting such data to a central
server is expensive and may leak sensitive user information, while
a viable way is to train LLMs in a federated manner. ii)Scalability
and efficiency: LLMs, such as GPT-3 [ 11], have an extremely large
number of parameters. Training LLMs on a single machine is infea-
sible and inflexible, while FL can be a good choice. iii)Continuous
improvement with user data: LLMs can be deployed in a federated
manner and local instances of the models can be further finetuned
based on the local data, which enables the global model to improve
over time based on users’ data without ever having direct access
to the data. This is particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive fields
such as healthcare [3, 103] and finance [68, 74].
FL, as well as federated LLMs, aim to maintain privacy and se-
curity of client data by allowing clients to train locally without
sharing their data to other parties. However, its decentralized and
collaborative nature inadvertently introduce privacy and security
vulnerabilities. Adversarial clients compromise the integrity of the
global model by submitting spurious models to prevent the global
model from converging [ 4,5,17,23,26,61,96] and/or planting
backdoors to induce the global model to mis-classify specific sam-
ples [ 4,5,92,95]. Adversaries can also reconstruct training data
from model updates or gradients [ 19,30,43,44,110]. Meanwhile,
a wide range of defense mechanisms has emerged to mitigate the
impact of these attacks [ 10,15,17,28,47,50,51,60,66,67,75,76,89,
90,99,101,106,108]. Despite the efforts for addressing the vulner-
ability of FL systems, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark
for comparing approaches under unified sittings.
Moreover, while existing works have explored effectiveness of
attacks and defenses on small-scale models, there remains a signifi-
cant gap in understanding how these mechanisms perform against
LLMs. Given that LLMs possess a large number of parameters and
are trained on complex datasets obtained from unregulated sources,
the effectiveness of attacks and defenses may be diminished whenTable 1: Attacks Implemented in FedSecurity

applied to LLMs. These motivate an urgent need for a standard-
ized and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate baseline attack and
defense strategies in the context of FL and federated LLMs.
This paper introduces FedSecurity1, a benchmark that simulates
attacks and defenses in FedML [ 38]. FedSecurity comprises two
primary components: FedAttacker and FedDefender. FedAttacker
simulates attacks in FL to help understand and prepare for potential
security risks, while FedDefender is equipped with the state-of-
the-art defense mechanisms to counteract the attacks injected by
FedAttacker. We summarize our contributions as follows:
i) Enabling benchmarking of several different attacks and
defenses in FL. FedSecurity implements attacks and defenses that
are widely considered in the literature. We summarize the attacks
and the defenses in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Security supports configurations using a .yaml file. Sample con-
figurations for attacks and defenses are shown in Figures 1a and
Figures 1b, respectively. FedSecurity also provides APIs to enable
customizing attacks and defenses.
iii) Supporting various models and FL optimizers. FedSecu-
rity can be utilized with a wide range of models, including Lo-
gistic Regression, LeNet [ 55], ResNet [ 40], CNN [ 54], RNN [ 84],
GAN [ 31], etc. FedSecurity is compatible with various FL optimiz-
ers, such as FedAVG [ 71], FedSGD [ 86], FedOPT [ 81], FedPROX [ 59],
FedGKT [37], FedGAN [80], FedNAS [39], FedNOVA [97], etc.
iv) Extensions to federated LLMs and real-world applications.
FedSecurity can simulate attacks and defenses during training of
federated LLMs. It can also be integrated with real-world FL ap-
plications; see Exp 7, where we utilize edge devices from Theta
Network [91] as clients instead of simulating on a single machine.

Key takeaways :i) While defense mechanisms can help mitigate
attacks, it might also bring a loss of accuracy to the aggregation
results. Therefore, when integrating defenses into FL applications,
it’s crucial to weigh the benefits against potential drawbacks. ii)
Nearly all existing defense mechanisms are impractical in real-
world FL applications, as they compromise accuracy even if no
attack happened. However, attacks happen infrequently in practice.
A defense strategy that is practical for real-world systems is in need,
where the defense should satisfy: 1) it must detect if attacks have
happened and only activate the defense mechanism when attacks
are detected; and 2) it must identify malicious clients accurately
without harming benign local models. iii) Based on our findings,
we have developed a novel defense strategy; see [35] for details.
2 PRELIMINARIES AND OVERVIEW
This section discusses existing FL security frameworks, then intro-
duces adversarial models, and finally overviews FedSecurity.
2.1 Existing Benchmark Frameworks
Recent years, researchers have proposed multiple benchmarks for
FL [1,7,21,52,58,62,63,82,83,87,102,111]. Among these, only
Blades [ 58] and FederatedScope [ 102] study the implications of
adversarial attacks in FL. Blades implements a wide range of at-
tacks, such as [ 5,23,57,85,100], as well as corresponding defenses
against those attacks, e.g., [ 10,48,104,104]. While Blades focuses
more on model poisoning attacks and data poisoning attacks, it
fails to include an important line of work, i.e., data reconstruc-
tion attacks. FederatedScope [ 102] implements data reconstruction
attacks that utilize models or gradients to revert sensitive informa-
tion, including GAN-based leakage attack [ 42], Passive Property
Inference [ 73], and DLG attack [ 110]. However, it neglects to ad-
dress attacks prevalent in the research literature, e.g., Byzantine
attacks [ 105,106]. It also does not include any defense mechanisms
for FL. It is worth noting that, while FederatedScope integratessecret-sharing [ 6] for enhancing data privacy, it is in the scope of
federated analytics [22, 46, 78, 93], instead of FL.
FedSecurity implements attacks that are widely considered in
the literature and covers attacks that are injected at different stages
of FL, such as model poisoning attacks, data poisoning attacks,
and data reconstruction attacks [ 4,5,17,19,23,26,30,61,92,95,
96,110]. It also integrates defense mechanisms to protect against
the attacks [ 10,17,28,35,47,75,76,90,99,101,106]. Moreover,
FedSecurity offers flexible configurations and APIs, which enables
users to customize their attack and defense strategies efficiently.
2.2 Adversarial Model
Adversaries in FL can be active or passive, corresponding to security
risks and privacy threat in FL, respectively.
Active Adversaries. Active adversaries intentionally manipulate
training data or trained models to achieve malicious goals. This
might involve altering models to prevent global model from con-
verging (e.g., Byzantine attacks [ 17,23]), or subtly misclassifying a
specific set of samples to minimally impact the overall performance
of the global model (e.g., backdoor attacks [ 4,95,109]). Active adver-
saries can take different forms, including: 1) malicious clients who
manipulate their local models [ 4,17,23,109] or submit contrived
models without actual training [ 96]; 2) a global “sybil” [ 28,92] that
has full access to the FL system and possesses complete knowledge
of the entire system, including local models and global models, as
well as clients’ local datasets. This “sybil” may also modify clients’
local datasets and their local models submitted to the server; and 3)
external adversaries or hackers that monitor the communication
channel between the clients and the server, thereby intercepting
and altering local models during the transfer process.
Passive Adversaries. Passive adversaries do not modify data or
models, but can still breach data privacy by inferring sensitive
information, such as local training data, from model updates or
gradients [ 110]. Examples of passive adversaries include: 1) an
adversarial FL server that tries to guess local training data using

Adversaries can inject attacks at different stages of FL. Active
adversaries can conduct model poisoning attacks to manipulate
local models or data poisoning attacks to tamper with local data,
while passive adversaries pose privacy threats by exploiting model
updates or gradients, i.e.,data reconstruction attacks.
2.3 Overview of FedSecurity
FedSecurity serves as an external component of FedML [ 38] and in-
jects attacks and defenses at different stages of FL training, without
altering the existing FL procedures. FedSecurity utilizes FedAttacker
and FedDefender to initiate two instances to simulate attacks and
defenses, respectively. Such two instances are initialized once and
are accessed by other objects in the FL system, a design achieved
using the singleton design pattern [29].
We summarize the injections of attacks and defenses to the FL
framework in FedSecurity in Figure 2. We also provide detailed
algorithms for injecting attacks and defenses to different stages of
FL training, as shown in Algorithm 1 (for server aggregation) and
Algorithm 2 (for client training). Below we introduce injections of
attacks and defenses, respectively.
2.3.1 Injection of attacks. Without loss of generality, we classify
the attacks into the following categories based on their targets:
(1)Data poisoning attacks conducted by active adversaries to mod-
ify clients’ local datasets and are injected at clients [19, 92].
(2)Model poisoning attacks that are also conducted by active ad-
versaries to temper with local models submitted by clients that
participate in the current FL iteration [8, 23, 85].

The input local_models is a list of tuples that contain the number of samples and the local models submitted by clients in each FL iteration.
The input auxiliary _info can be any information that is utilized in the attack functions, e.g., the global model in the last FL iteration.
(3)Data reconstruction attacks that are conducted by passive adver-
saries by exploring local models, model updates, or gradients to
infer information about the training data [25, 65, 72, 98, 107].
Without loss of generality, FedAttacker injects data poisoning
attacks and model poisoning attacks before the aggregation of
local models in each FL training round at the server, such that the
FedAttacker instance can get access to all client models submitted
in the FL training round. FedAttacker injects data reconstruction
attacks at the FL server as well, where the FL server has access
to all local models and the global model of each iteration and can
perform the attacks with high flexibility.
2.3.2 Injection of defenses. FedDefender incorporates defenses to
mitigate, if not completely nullify, the impacts of injected attacks.
The defenses are designed to address issues related to tampered
local models or manipulated local datasets, which lead to compro-
mised model integrity, or information leakage during the exchange
of model updates between clients and the FL server. The defenses
manipulate local models and the aggregation procedure to counter-
act the attacks.
To facilitate this, FedDefender deploys defenses at the FL server,
and provides flexible APIs that enable obtaining all local models and
the global model of each FL round while allowing for a customized
aggregation process. FedDefender utilize three functions at different
stages of FL aggregation:
(1)Before-aggregation functions that modify local models at the
server before aggregating them.
(2)On-aggregation functions that modify the FL aggregation func-
tion to mitigate the impacts of malicious local models.
(3)After-aggregation functions that modify the aggregated global
model (e.g., by adding noise or clipping) to protect the real
global model or improve its quality.
3 IMPLEMENTATION OF ATTACKS
FedAttacker injects model poisoning, data poisoning, and data
reconstruction attacks at different stages of FL training and providesAPIs for these attacks. We summarize the customization APIs in
Table 3 and introduce each type of attacks in details.
3.1 Model Poisoning Attacks
Model poisoning attacks modify the local models uploaded by
clients in FL iterations. FedAttacker injects such attacks before
FL aggregation in each FL iteration and modifies the local models
directly. As an example, FedAttacker implements three modes of
Byzantine attacks [61, 104–106], as follows.
(1)Zero mode [ 61] that poisons the client models by setting their
weights to zero;
(2)Random mode [61] that manipulates client models by attributing
random values to model weights; and
(3)Flipping mode [104] that updates the global model in the oppo-
site direction by formulating the local model as w𝑔+(w𝑔−wℓ),
where w𝑔is the global model, and wℓis the real local model.
3.2 Data Poisoning Attacks
Data poisoning attacks modify local datasets of one or multiple
clients to achieve some malicious goals, e.g., degrading the perfor-
mance of the global model or inducing the global model to misclas-
sify some samples. As an example, in label flipping attack [ 92], a
global “sybil” controls some clients and modifies their local data
by mislabeling samples of some classes to wrong classes. Given a
source class (or label) 𝑐sand a target class 𝑐t, all samples with class
𝑐son the poisoned clients are re-labeled to an incorrect label 𝑐t.
While poisoning local data can be performed by either a global
“sybil” or malicious clients, to address a more general case, FedAt-
tacker offers APIs to enable control over each local dataset.
3.3 Data Reconstruction Attacks
Data reconstruction attacks are performed by passive adversaries
that attempts to infer sensitive information without actively inter-
fering with the FL training or the local data. We assume that there
is no leakage during the local training process in FL, as clients are

assumed to be on their fully trusted local machines, according to
the motivation of FL. As a result, data reconstruction attacks take
the trained models (either the global model or the local models)
or model updates to revert training data. For example, Deep Leak-
age from Gradients (DLG) attack [ 110] infers local training data
from the publicly shared gradients. A passive adversary can use the
global model from the previous FL training round and the newly
obtained model to compute a “model update” between models in
different FL training rounds to deduce the training data.
3.4 Integration of a New Attack
To customize a new attack, users should follow these steps.
(1)Determine the type of the attack, i.e., model poisoning, data
poisoning, or data reconstruction.
(2)Create a new class for the attack and implement functions to
inject attacks at the appropriate stages of FL training using
the provided APIs, e.g.,attack _model(∗),poison _data(∗), and
reconstruct _data(∗).
(3)Add the attack name to the corresponding enabler functions,
e.g.,is_model _poisoning _attack(), within the FedAttacker class
to ensure that the injected attacks are activated at the proper
stages of FL training.
4 IMPLEMENTATION OF DEFENSES
FedDefender injects defense functions at different stages of FL ag-
gregation at the server. Based on the point of injection, FedDefender
provides three types of functions to support defense mechanisms,
including 1) before-aggregation, 2) on-aggregation, and 3) after-
aggregation. Note that a defense may inject functions at one or
multiple stages of FL aggregation. The APIs for defense functions
in FedDefender are summarized in Table 4.4.1 Before-Aggregation Defenses
Before-aggregation functions operate on local models at the FL
server before aggregating the local models. Such functions may
compute scores for the local models to identify potentially mali-
cious local models, or re-weight the local models to mitigate the
impacts of the malicious ones. We use Krum [ 10] as an example to
demonstrate before-aggregation defenses.
Krum. Krum [ 10] tolerates 𝑓Byzantine clients among 𝑛clients by
retaining only one local model that is the most likely to be benign as
the global model. That is, Krum selects a single model as the global
model in aggregation. A generalization of Krum is 𝑚-Krum [ 10] that
selects 𝑚client models with the 𝑚lowest scores for aggregation,
instead of choosing only one local model. This approach requires
less than𝑛−𝑚
2−1clients to be malicious.
4.2 On-Aggregation Defenses
On-aggregation defense functions modify the aggregation function
to a robust version that tolerates or mitigates impacts of the poten-
tial adversarial client models. As an example, RFA [ 76] computes
a geometric median of the client models in each iteration as the
aggregated model, instead of simply averaging the client models.
In practice, the geometric median is calculated using the Smoothed
Weiszfeld Algorithm [ 76]. RFA defense effectively mitigates the
impact of poisoned client models, as the geometric median can
represent the central tendency of the client models, and the median
point is chosen in a way to minimize the sum of distances between
that point and the other client models of the current FL iteration.
4.3 After-Aggregation Defenses
After-aggregation defense functions modify the aggregation result,
i.e., the global model, of each FL iteration to mitigate the effects of
poisoned local models or protect the global model from potential
adversaries. As an example, CRFL [ 99] clips the global model to
bound the norm of the model each time after aggregation at the

global model before distributing the global model to the clients for
the next FL iteration.
4.4 Integration of a New Defense
The steps to integrate a customized defense mechanism are sum-
marized as follows.
(1)Determine the stages where the defense operates, i.e., before-
aggregation, on-aggregation, or after-aggregation.
(2)Add a class for the new defense and implement the correspond-
ing defense functions to inject functions at appropriate stages of
FL using the provided APIs, i.e.,defend _before _aggregation(∗),
defend _on_aggregation(∗), and defend _after _aggregation(∗).
(3)Add the name of the defense to the enabler functions to activate
the defense functions at the different stages of FL.
Note that some defenses involve more than one stage, thus, users
need to implement all relevant functions.
5 EVALUATIONS
This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of FedSecurity
to benchmark some well-known attacks and defenses in FL.
Experimental setting. A summary of datasets and models for
evaluations can be found in Table 5. We utilize FedAVG in our
experiments. By default, we employ ResNet20 and the non-i.i.d. CI-
FAR10 dataset (partition parameter 𝛼=0.5), as the non-i.i.d. setting
captures real-world scenarios closely. We further extend our evalu-
ations to i.i.d. cases and other models and datasets. For evaluations
on LLMs, we utilize FedLLM [ 24] that trains LLMs in a federated
manner. We employ the Pythia-1B model [ 9] and PubMedQA [ 45],
a non-i.i.d. biomedical research dataset that contains 212,269 ques-
tions for question answering. We utilize the “artificial” subset for
training and the “labelled” subset for testing. Evaluations are con-
ducted on a server with 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs.
By default, we use 10 clients for FL training, corresponding to
real-world FL applications where the number of clients is typically
less than 10, especially in business-to-business (B2B) scenarios. We
also increase the number of clients to 100 in Exp 5, and set the
number of clients to 70 in the real-world experiment, where we
utilize real edge devices from Theta network [ 91] to showcase the
scalability of FedSecurity (Exp 10). Unless otherwise noted, we
set the percentage of malicious clients to 10%, and evaluate results
with the accuracy of the global model. We employ three attack
mechanisms, including label flipping [ 92] and Byzantine attacks of
random mode and flipping mode [ 17,23,104]. For the label flipping
attack, we set the attack to modify the local and test data labels
of malicious clients from label 3 to label 9 and label 2 to label 1.
We utilize three defense mechanisms: 𝑚-Krum [ 10], Foolsgold [ 28],
and RFA [ 76]. For 𝑚-Krum, we set 𝑚to 5, which means 5 out of 10
local models participate in aggregation in each training round.5.1 Evaluations on FL
Exp 1: Attack Comparisons. We evaluate the impact of attacks
on test accuracy, using a no-attack scenario as a baseline. As illus-
trated in Figure 3, Byzantine attacks, specifically in the random and
zero modes, substantially degrade accuracy. In contrast, the label
flipping attack and the flipping mode of the Byzantine attack show
a milder impact on accuracy. This can be attributed to the nature
of Byzantine attacks, where Byzantine attackers would prevent the
global model from converging, especially for the random mode
that generates weights for models arbitrarily, causing the most
significant deviation from the benign local model. In subsequent
experiments, unless specified otherwise, we employ the Byzantine
attack in the random mode as the default attack, as it provides the
strongest impact compared with the other three attacks.
Exp 2: Defense Comparisons. We investigate potential impact
of defense mechanisms on accuracy in the absence of attacks, i.e.,
whether defense mechanisms inadvertently degrade accuracy when
all clients are benign. We incorporate a scenario without any de-
fense or attack as our baseline. As illustrated in Figure 4, it becomes
evident that when all clients are benign, involving defense strategies
to FL training might lead to a reduction in accuracy. This decrease
might arise from several factors: the exclusion of some benign local
models from aggregation, e.g., as in 𝑚-Krum, adjustments to the
aggregation function, e.g., as in RFA, or re-weighting local models,
e.g., as in Foolsgold. Specifically, the RFA defense mechanism signif-
icantly impacts accuracy as it computes a geometric median of the
local models instead of leveraging the original FedAVG optimizer,
which introduces a degradation in accuracy.
Exp 3: Evaluations of defense mechanisms against activated
attacks. This experiment evaluates the effect of defense mecha-
nisms against some attacks. We include two baseline scenarios: 1)
an “original attack” scenario with an activated attack without any
defense in place, and 2) a “benign” scenario with no activated attack
or defense. We select label flipping attack and the random mode
of Byzantine attack based on their impacts in Exp1, where label
flipping has the least impact and the random mode of Byzantine
attack exhibits the largest impact, as shown in Figure 3. Results for
the label flipping and the random mode of Byzantine attacks are in
Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. These results indicate that the
defenses may contribute to minor improvements in accuracy for
low-impact attacks, e.g., Foolsgold in Figure 5. In certain cases, it
is noteworthy that the defensive mechanisms may inadvertently
compromise accuracy, such as the case with RFA in Figure 5. For
high-impact attacks, such as the Byzantine attack of the random
mode, Krum exhibits resilience, effectively neutralizing the negative
impact of the attacks, as shown in Figure 6.
Exp 4: Evaluations on i.i.d. data. We select the random mode of
the Byzantine attack, and employ Foolsgold, 𝑚-Krum ( 𝑚=5), and
RFA to counteract the adverse effects of this attack. As shown in
Figure 7, 𝑚-Krum is the most effective one among all the defense

mechanisms, where the test accuracy is close to the case where all
the FL clients are honest, i.e., no attack scenario.
Exp 5: Scaling the number of clients to 100. We scale the number
of clients to 100 and evaluates the defense mechanisms against the
random mode of the Byzantine attack. We employ Foolsgold, 𝑚-
Krum (with 𝑚=5), and RFA to counteract the adverse effects of
this attack. As shown in Figure 8, 𝑚-Krum is the most effective one
among all the defense mechanisms, and the test accuracy is very
close to the case where no attack happens. That is because in each
FL iteration, 𝑚-Krum selects 5 local models that are more likely to
be benign, which can represent the other local models, thus can
achieve comparable accuracy compared with the benign case.
Exp 6: Evaluations on different models. We evaluate defense
mechanisms against the random mode of the Byzantine attack with
different models and datasets, including: i) ResNet56 + CIFAR100,
ii) RNN + Shakespeare, and iii) CNN + FEMNIST. The results are
shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11, respectively. The results show that
while the defense mechanisms can mitigate the impact of attacks
in most cases, some attacks may fail some tasks, e.g.,𝑚-Krum fails
RNN in Figure 10, and Foolsgold fails CNN in Figure 11. This is
because the two defense mechanisms either select several local
models for aggregation in each FL training round, or significantlyre-weight the local models, which may eliminate some local models
that are important to the aggregation in the first several FL training
iterations, leading to unchanged test accuracy in later FL iterations.
Exp 7: Varying the number of malicious clients. This experi-
ment evaluates the impact of varying numbers of malicious clients
on test accuracy. We utilize 𝑚-Krum to protect against 1, 2, and
3 malicious clients out of 10 clients in each FL training round. As
shown in Figure 12, the test accuracy remains relatively consistent
across different numbers of malicious clients, as in each FL training
round, 𝑚-Krum selects a local model that is the most likely to be
benign to represent the other models, effectively minimizing the
impact of malicious client models on the aggregation.
5.2 Evaluations on Federated LLMs
We employ two LLMs, BERT [ 20] and Pythia [ 9], to showcase the
scalability of FedSecurity and its applicability to federated LLM
scenarios. We notice that some defenses (e.g., Foolsgold [ 28]) that
require memorizing intermediate results, such as models of previous
FL training rounds, might encounter limitations when integrated
with LLMs due to the significant cache introduced. Considering this,
we utilize 𝑚-Krum for our experiments, as it does not require storing
intermediate results and demonstrates consistent performance in
most of our previous experiments.
Exp 8: Evaluations of Krum against model replacement back-
door attack on BERT. This experiment utilizes BERT [ 20] and
the 20 news dataset [ 53] for a classification task. We employ 10
clients and set 1 client to be malicious in each FL training round.
We set 𝑚to 5 in 𝑚-Krum, i.e., 5 out of 10 local models participate
in aggregation in each FL training round. Results in Figure 13 show
that 𝑚-Krum effectively mitigates the adversarial effect, bringing
the accuracy closer to the level of the attack-free case.
Exp 9: Evaluations of Krum against the Byzantine attack on
Pythia-1B. In this experiment, we utilize 𝑚-Krum to counter the

Byzantine attack of the random mode. We employ 7 clients for FL
training, where one client is malicious in each round of FL training.
We set the 𝑚parameter in 𝑚-Krum to 2, signifying that two out of
the 7 local models participate in the aggregation in each FL training
round. The performance is evaluated with the test loss. Results in
Figure 14 show that Byzantine attack significantly increases the test
loss during training. Nevertheless, 𝑚-Krum effectively mitigates
the adversarial effect.
5.3 Evaluation in Real-World Applications
To demonstrate the scalability of our benchmark, we include an
experiment using real-world devices, instead of simulations.
Exp10: Evaluations in real-world applications. We utilize edge
devices from the Theta network [ 91] to validate the scalability of
FedSecurity to real-world applications. The FL client package is
integrated into Theta’s edge nodes, and periodically fetches data
from the Theta back-end. Subsequently, the FL training platform
leverages the Theta edge nodes and their associated data to train
and deploy machine learning models.
We select 𝑚-Krum as the defense and the Byzantine attack of
random mode as the attack. Considering the challenges posed by
real-world environments, such as devices equipped solely with
CPUs (lacking GPUs), potential device connectivity issues, network
latency, and limited storage on edge devices (for instance, somemobile devices might have less than 500MB of available storage),
we choose a simple task by employing the MNIST dataset for a
logistic regression task. In our experimental setup, we deploy 70
client edge devices, designating 7 of these as malicious for each FL
training round. For 𝑚-Krum, we set 𝑚to 35, meaning that 35 out
of the 70 local models are involved in aggregation during each FL
training round. As illustrated in Figure 15, 𝑚-Krum mitigates the
adversarial effect of the random-mode Byzantine attack. We also
include a screenshot for the FL training process in Figure 16.
6 CONCLUSION
This paper presents FedSecurity, a benchmark for adversarial at-
tacks and corresponding defense strategies in FL. FedSecurity con-
tains two components: FedAttacker that simulates various attacks
that can be injected during FL training, and FedDefender that fa-
cilitates defense strategies to mitigate the impacts of these attacks.
The limitation of FedSecurity is that it does not support asynchro-
nous FL and vertical FL yet. FedSecurity is open-sourced, and we
welcome contributions from the research community to enrich the
benchmark repository with novel attack and defense strategies to
foster a diverse, comprehensive, and robust foundation for ongoing
research in FL security.
