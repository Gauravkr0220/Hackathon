ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success
across various domains, but their capability in understanding and
resolving complex graph problems is less explored. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GraphInstruct, a novel instruction-tuning dataset
aimed at enabling language models to tackle a broad spectrum of
graph problems through explicit reasoning paths. Utilizing GraphIn-
struct, we build GraphWiz , an open-source language model capable
of solving various graph computational problems while generating
clear reasoning processes. To further enhance the model’s perfor-
mance and reliability, we integrate the Direct Preference Optimiza-
tion (DPO) framework within the graph problem-solving context.
The improved model, GraphWiz -DPO, achieves an average accuracy
of 65% across nine tasks with different complexity levels, surpassing
GPT-4 which has an average accuracy of 43.8%. Our study also in-
vestigates the relationship between training data volume and model
performance, emphasizing the risk of overfitting as data volume
increases. Additionally, we explore the transferability of the pro-
posed model across different tasks and datasets, demonstrating its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. GraphWiz offers a new
blueprint and valuable insights for developing LLMs specialized in
graph reasoning and problem-solving.1

1 INTRODUCTION
After witnessing the remarkable capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in text processing, the research community is now
exploring their applicability across diverse modalities such as vi-
sion, audio, tabular, and spatio-temporal data [ 8,19,27,40,42,51].
Graphs, with their non-Euclidean nature and relationship-centric
characteristics, present a particularly challenging yet promising
frontier for LLM exploration. The synergy between graphs and
LLMs has sparked considerable interest due to their potential for
bi-directional benefits: integrating graph-based approaches can
advance the reasoning abilities of LLMs, enabling them to tackle
complex logical tasks such as mathematical problem-solving [ 5,48]
and commonsense reasoning [ 44]. Conversely, LLMs offer powerful
capabilities to augment graph analysis, particularly in the realm of
semantically-rich, text-attributed networks [10, 31, 37].
While the intersection of graphs and LLMs is an emerging field,
it remains uncertain to what extent LLMs can comprehend a graph
merely from the context. Current graph machine learning tasks, such
as node classification and link prediction, primarily require LLMs
to focus on the semantic aspects of graphs [ 6,7,13,14,29,30,38,45,
49]. This often entails a basic understanding of local subgraph struc-
tures. Although benchmarks like mathematical problem-solving
[5,35,48] and knowledge-oriented question-answering [ 4,45–47]
necessitate multi-hop reasoning within a graph, they do not always
demand an in-depth understanding of the entire graph’s structure.

Connectivity ：
task -specific Q𝑮-Q: Determine whether two nodes are connected in an 
undirected graph. In an undirected graph, ( i,j) means that 
node iand node j are connected with an undirected edge. 
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are: 
(0,1) (0,7) (0,6) (1,7) (1,5) (1,6) (5,9) (2,8) (2,4) (2,3) (3,8). Is 
there a path between node 7 and node 9?Input
R: Node 7 is connected to node 1, node 1 is 
connected to node 5, node 5 is connected 
to node 9. We can follow the path: [7 ->1->5-
>9], so the answer is yes.

Figure 1: An example of solving the Connectivity task explicitly within natural language via LLMs.
To address this, newer benchmarks like GraphQA [ 10,24] and
NLGraph [ 37] introduce more diverse and complex graph compu-
tational problems to LLMs, demanding a more profound grasp of
graph structures—challenges typically addressed by specific compu-
tational algorithms. Figure 1 showcases giving an undirected graph
and two nodes in this graph, the LLM needs to answer whether
these two nodes are connected through a path. Other similar prob-
lems include finding the shortest path and subgraph isomorphism,
etc.
Current methodologies for tackling graph problems with lan-
guage models largely rely on the art of prompt design, seeking to
enhance the performance of LLMs through well-crafted prompts
[10,37]. Notably, this strategy has shown more effectiveness in
closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4 [ 22] and PaLM 2 [ 1]. In con-
trast, open-source LLMs like LLaMA [ 34] demonstrate consider-
ably weaker results using the same methods. Additionally, com-
plex prompts that transform edges into sentences can lengthen the
context, restricting model’s scalability for larger graphs. Indeed,
previous studies [ 3,10,24,37] have limited graph sizes to very small
scales (e.g., fewer than 20 nodes and 100 edges). Existing methods
also lack the capability to control or understand the output rea-
soning process. This raises concerns about whether the model is
accurately deducing answers through logical reasoning or simply
making correct guesses. Significantly, there is a noticeable gap in the
availability of an open-source language model proficient in explicitly
and accurately solving these graph problems.
In this paper, we aspire to enhance the graph problem-solving
abilities of current open-source LLMs and finetune a single model
that can solve various types of graph problems and meanwhile out-
put explicit reasoning paths, as the example of connectivity shown
in Figure 1. However, developing instruction-following models for
graph problems is challenging due to the absence of a robust train-
ing corpus equipped to aid models in producing explicit reasoning
paths. Such paths are critical for understanding and evaluating the
model’s reasoning process. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a
novel instruction-tuning dataset named GraphInstruct, which is de-
signed to serve as a foundational corpus, enabling language models
to not only comprehend graph problems but also articulate clear
and logical reasoning paths. GraphInstruct is constructed with the
“self-augment” idea: we first sample multiple explicit predictions
for each graph problem sample using few-shot Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) [ 42] prompting method based on GPT-4, and then finetune a
smaller LLM on these predictions. Given a graph problem, the fine-
tuned model is used to augment the original corpus by generating
diverse reasoning paths. This self-augmentation process is crucial
in enhancing the diversity and complexity of the reasoning paths,thereby enriching the dataset and making it more representative
of various graph problems. GraphInstruct offers 72,785 training
samples across nine graph problem tasks, ranging from linear and
polynomial complexity to NP-complete, extending the scope and
scale of previous benchmarks.
Upon constructing a corpus specialized for explicit reasoning
in graph problems, we fine-tuned current open-source LLMs, in-
cluding the LLaMA 2 families [ 33,34] and Mistral [ 15,16]. The
resulting model, GraphWiz , achieves superior performances in solv-
ing various graph computational problems. Our training strategy
involves mixed-task instruction tuning and directly preference op-
timization (DPO) alignment. This dual-focused approach ensures
the model not only imitates the best examples but also actively
avoids common errors. As a result, the most advanced version of
GraphWiz -DPO achieves an average accuracy of 65% across all tasks,
significantly outperforming GPT-4, which has an average accuracy
of 43.8%. Finally, we delve into the nuanced relationship between
training volume, model performance, and overfitting risks. We find
that while increasing training data volume generally leads to im-
proved model performance, there is a threshold beyond which the
benefits diminish and the risk of overfitting becomes pronounced.
Additionally, we explore the potential of transferring the model’s
reasoning ability across different graph computational problems.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
•We collect the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset named
GraphInstruct specifically designed for training LLMs on a vari-
ety of graph computational tasks. This dataset enables the trained
models to output explicit reasoning paths and arrive at final an-
swers, significantly enhancing the models’ interpretability.
•We introduce GraphWiz , the first open-source LLM specialized
for solving graph problems of various types and scales through
explicit reasoning. This model markedly outperforms the current
best closed-source model, GPT-4, demonstrating superior capa-
bility in understanding complex graph structures and addressing
related tasks.
•We analyze potential factors that impact model performance in
detail, such as the volume of training data and the sampling
strategy for dispreferred samples within the DPO framework.
This analysis provides valuable insights into model optimization
and performance enhancement across diverse graph tasks.

the models’ inherent ability to process and generate language, re-
fining it to follow specified tasks more accurately. Concretely, it
involves providing a model with a set of instructions or prompts
that define specific tasks it should perform. These instructions are
formulated in natural language and are designed to guide the model
in understanding and executing various tasks. The process then in-
volves adjusting the model’s parameters to optimize its performance
on these tasks. To date, it’s recognized as an essential approach to
enhance the LLMs’ ability to understand and execute a broad range
of tasks based on natural language instructions. In this work:
We aim at leveraging instruction-tuning to build a powerful
instruction-following LLM that can understand textural
descriptions of graph structures and solve various graph
problems explicitly in natural language.

open-source LLMs (e.g., 4096 tokens), we eliminate excessively long
graph problems to maintain compatibility, ensuring no graph ex-
ceeds 100 nodes. (3) Unique Instances. To build a robust dataset,
it is crucial that each problem within the training and testing sets
is unique. (4) Efficient Graph Description. In the textual descrip-
tions of each problem, we only specify the total number of nodes
and depict edges using tuples ( 𝑢,𝑣), where𝑢and𝑣represent the
connected nodes. As illustrated in Figures 1, 8 and Table ??, this
graph description language maximize graph sizes within the limits
of input length constraints.We curate an initial set of 27,000 graph problems ( G-𝑄) for train-
ing, distributed across nine tasks, with 3,000 pairs allocated to each.
Furthermore, we prepare 3,600 graph problems ( G-𝑄) for testing,
also divided among nine tasks, with each task receiving 400 pairs.
Notably, we only annotate Rfor the training problems.
3.1.3 Generation of Explicit Reasoning Paths. The most distinctive
aspect of GraphInstruct is that each G-𝑄pair is coupled with an
explicit reasoning path, R. Given the intensive effort required to
manually annotate these paths for graph tasks, we utilize GPT-4 to
generate preliminary reasoning paths. Each G-𝑄is fed into GPT-4
with a CoT prompt designed to draw out an explicit reasoning path,
concluding with “The answer is,” to direct the model towards a
definitive solution. To promote diversity in responses, we employ
a sampling strategy with a temperature setting of 0.9, repeating
the procedure three times for each problem. We then select only
thoseG-𝑄pairs that demonstrate accurate reasoning paths—those
leading to the correct answer—to form our initial dataset, 𝐷1, which
includes fewer than 8,000 samples.
 
356GraphWiz: An Instruction-Following Language Model for
Graph Computational Problems KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
Data Augmentation with Rejection Sampling. Observations
indicate that GPT-4 struggles with numerous graph tasks, such as
yielding fewer than 100 correct samples for the Maximum Flow
task in𝐷1. To enrich the dataset with a broader range of reasoning
paths, we implement a rejection sampling strategy [ 5]. Using𝐷1,
we develop a specialized data augmentation model, designated as
M1, serving two primary functions: (1) IncreasingG-𝑄quan-
tity:M1is aimed at correctly answering questions that GPT-4
previously mishandled, thus increasing the number of viable G-𝑄
pairs. (2) Generating diverse paths: M1is also designed to gen-
erate multiple diverse reasoning paths for the same G-𝑄, thereby
enhancing the diversity of our dataset. Specifically, Specifically,
M1processes the initial 27,000 graph problems, with the goal of
producing multiple reasoning paths per problem through repeated
sampling, aiming to significantly broaden the dataset’s diversity.
Diverse Reasoning Path Selection. A pivotal aspect of rejection
sampling involves selecting correct and diverse reasoning paths to
ensure the dataset’s quality and utility. Balancing accuracy with
diversity presents significant challenges in this phase. To tackle
these, we employ refined strategies divided into string-based and
semantic-based approaches for selecting distinct generated reason-
ing paths:
•String-based strategies: These include using edit distance, TF-
IDF[2], and Jaccard similarity to evaluate the uniqueness and
relevance of the reasoning paths, ensuring a broad representation
of problem-solving techniques.
•Semantic-based strategies: We utilize Sentence-BERT [ 26] to
encode the reasoning paths and apply cosine similarity andK-
means clustering [20] to assess their semantic coherence and
diversity, encouraging distinct and logically coherent paths.
In our string-based and semantic-based selection strategies, ex-
cept for K-means clustering, the methodology necessitates a ref-
erence or anchor sample to effectively measure the diversity of
reasoning paths. This anchor acts as the pivot for assessing the
diversity of other paths. We select the longest correct reasoning path
generated for each problem as the anchor, based on the assumption
that it is likely to encompass a comprehensive and detailed reason-
ing process [ 17], thus serving as an ideal reference for evaluating
the diversity of other paths.
After applying each selection strategy, we compile the final
GraphInstruct, 𝐷, by incorporating the reasoning paths that ex-
hibit the greatest diversity compared to the anchor path, as deter-
mined by each strategy. In contrast, K-means clustering groups
the generated reasoning paths based on their semantic similar-
ity, from which we identify and select a representative path from
each cluster, filtering out repetitive reasoning paths and ensuring
the left paths remain diverse and distinct. This approach guaran-
tees that GraphInstruct contains not only correct solutions to graph
problems but also a broad spectrum of reasoning styles and method-
ologies. GraphInstruct fosters the development of LLMs capable of
generating explicit and interpretable reasoning paths, significantly
enhancing their problem-solving proficiency across a diverse array
of graph computational problems. Through this endeavor, we aim
to bridge the gap between the current capabilities of LLMs and the
complex demands of graph problem-solving.3.1.4 GraphInstruct Statistics. GraphInstruct encompasses 17,158
graph-question (G-𝑄) pairs, 313,051 nodes ( V), and 72,785 rea-
soning paths (R), with each graph problem potentially linked to
multiple paths. Easy tasks are more prevalent, while tasks like Max-
imum Flow and Topology Sort are less common. This imbalance is
primarily due to the difficulty of generating correct reasoning paths,
even with advanced models such as GPT-4. Reasoning paths are piv-
otal in our dataset, as a single G-𝑄pair may correspond to multiple
unique paths, thereby enriching the diversity of GraphInstruct. Ad-
ditionally, the test set introduces more complex challenges, where
an increased number of nodes generally indicates greater difficulty
in graph-related problems. This comprehensive dataset forms a
robust foundation for training and testing models across a range of
graph computational challenges, from basic to advanced levels, as
the comparison in Table 3.
3.2 GraphWiz
Based on the GraphInstruct dataset, we develop GraphWiz , which
is designed to enhance the capabilities of current LLMs in solving
graph computational problems with explicit reasoning paths. The
training methodology for GraphWiz involves a novel two-phase pro-
cess. Initially, we employ Mixed-Task Instruction Tuning to refine
the model’s ability to interpret and solve a diverse array of graph
problems. The subsequent phase, DPO Alignment, further sharpens
the model’s reasoning by training it to differentiate between more
and less effective problem-solving paths. This approach, especially
the application of DPO in the realm of graph problems, marks a
significant advancement in teaching LLMs not only to generate ex-
plicit answers but also to develop and adhere to a logical reasoning
process that mimics expert problem-solving behavior.
3.2.1 Phase 1: Mixed-Task Instruction Tuning. The initial phase
of our training, called Mixed-Task Instruction Tuning, involves
training the model simultaneously on all nine graph tasks from
the GraphInstruct dataset. This strategy is designed to provide the
model with comprehensive capabilities to solve a diverse array of
graph problems by adhering to task-specific instructions. Addition-
ally, it leverages the synergies among different tasks to enhance
overall model performance.
During this phase, we employ Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
with a conventional language modeling loss. The model is trained
to process both the graph Gand its corresponding prompt question
𝑄as inputs and to generate textual reasoning paths Ras outputs.
The SFT loss is computed based on the discrepancy between the
model’s predicted reasoning paths and the actual reasoning paths
in the dataset, formally defined as follows:
LLM=−𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝑀∑︁
𝑗=1logP(R𝑖,𝑗|G𝑖,𝑄𝑖;𝜃) (2)
where𝑁represents the number of examples, 𝑀is the total number
of reasoning paths for G𝑖-𝑄𝑖, and𝜃are the parameters of the model.
This optimization process trains the model to map graph struc-
tures and textual prompts to their corresponding reasoning paths,
thereby fostering a deep understanding of how to navigate and solve
graph problems using explicit reasoning. The model developed in
Phase 1 is namedM(𝜃)sft.

3.2.2 Phase 2: DPO Alignment of Reasoning Abilities. The sec-
ond phase of training incorporates Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to enhance the model’s reasoning capabilities. DPO refines
the learned SFT model, M(𝜃)sft, by aligning it more closely with
preferred outcomes using a training corpus similar to the SFT data
domain. Specifically, DPO employs input pairs labeled ( R𝑤,R𝑙),
whereR𝑤andR𝑙denote the preferred and less preferred reasoning
paths, respectively. In the context of graph problem-solving, the
challenge is: how do we obtainR𝑤andR𝑙for eachG-𝑄pair?
To generate these pairs for each G-𝑄, we start by generating
a new set of 9,000 graph problems. Using the SFT model M(𝜃)sft,
we infer outcomes 20 times for each problem. Consistent with the
approach in Section 3.1.3, we select the longest correct path as the
preferred reasoning path ( R𝑤). For less preferred paths ( R𝑙), the
selection process includes: (1) Using the preferred sample as an
anchor, we employ the string-based and semantic-based selection
methods (excluding K-means) described in Section 3.1.3 to iden-
tify the closest incorrect path to the preferred one. (2) We then use
Majority Voting [ 39] to determine the most frequently occurring
incorrect path across these strategies, which serves as our dispre-
ferred sample.
This methodology not only ensures the identification of rea-
soning paths that align with the model’s understanding but also
targets hard-negative examples similar to the preferred paths but
are fundamentally incorrect. This approach significantly enhances
the effectiveness of the DPO stage by rigorously challenging the
model to distinguish and preferentially align its reasoning capabili-
ties toward more accurate and logical problem-solving strategies.
Finally, we collect 6,166 G-𝑄-R𝑤-R𝑙samples for our DPO training
corpus, with detailed statistics available in the Appendix, Table 7.

4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate the proposed GraphWiz by addressing
the following research questions: RQ1: How does GraphWiz per-
form on these graph tasks, particularly in comparison to the most
powerful closed-source model, such as GPT-4? RQ2: What is theimpact of training data volume variations on GraphWiz ’s perfor-
mance? RQ3: How transferable is GraphWiz across different graph
tasks? RQ4: How do changes in the number of nodes in a graph
affect GraphWiz ’s performance, and what is the maximum com-
plexity of graphs it can effectively handle? RQ5: How does hyper-
parameter𝛽influence model performance.
4.1 Experimental Settings
Experimentally, we define baselines across two principal settings: (1)
In-Context Learning, where the model parameters remain fixed.
We utilize state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs as robust baselines,
including GPT-3.5 ( turbo-0613 ) and GPT-4 ( 2023-03-14-preview ).
Their effectiveness is evaluated using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt-
ing, which provides the model with a sequence of examples that
sequentially address task solutions. These models are then tasked
to replicate this reasoning in their outputs for new problems. We
assess their performance under zero-shot and 2-shot scenarios. For
zero-shot prompts, the phrase “Let’s think step by step” is included
to stimulate the generation of autonomous CoTs. (2) Training with
Naive Labels: Our focus here is on training smaller-scale LLMs
with simplified labels—direct answers like ‘yes’ or ‘no’, without de-
tailed reasoning paths. This approach is termed Naive-SFT. Addi-
tionally, we test three Graph Neural Network (GNN) models—Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) [ 18], Graph Isomorphism Network
(GIN) [ 43], and Graph Attention Network (GAT) [ 36]—on seven of
the nine tasks using identical training and test sets as GraphWiz .
Topology and Hamilton are excluded as they require path-based
reasoning, which GNNs are not originally support.
4.1.1 Implementation. In this work, we use open-source LLaMA
2-7B/13B and Mistral-7B as backbone models, allowing us to build
GraphWiz in multiple scales and architectures. Our codebase is built
on DeepSpeed and Huggingface Library. For all models, we set the
learning rate, epochs, and max length as 2e-5, 3, and 2048, running
on NVIDIA 8*A800 GPUs. The batch size is set to 16 or 32. We
use the alpaca-instruction format during training. For the GraphIn-
struct generation in Section 3.1.3, we use 2-shot CoT prompting
for GPT-4. For rejection sampling to augment the data, we train
LLaMA 2-13B model for this purpose. Specifically, we sample 30
times with a temperature of 0.9 for each sample, pursuing a high
diversity of reasoning paths. For testing, we set temperature as
0 and maximum output tokens as 1024, ensuring the stable and
reasonable generation. All GNNs use a hidden dimension size of 16,

4.2 Performance of GraphWiz (RQ1)
We repeat our evaluation three times and report the average results
in Table 4 and Figure 4. Notably, our models exhibit exceptional
results across various backbones, significantly surpassing GPT-
4’s performance.This consistency is maintained across a range of
tasks, from easy to difficult. DPO further enhances the average
performance across tasks. However, DPO might adversely affect
specific tasks, indicating that while DPO generally improves model
reasoning, it may require further tuning to avoid negative impacts
on certain problem types. Although Naive SFT shows commendable

performance, even slightly better than GPT-4, it is unclear if the
outcomes are from random guessing or actual task understanding.
Dataset Transfer. In addition to our constructed test set, we also
utilize NLGraph [ 37] as part of our testing suite. Given the im-
balanced distribution of graph task samples within NLGraph, we
select three tasks for evaluation: Cycle Detection, Maximum Flow,
and Shortest Path. We directly test our models without any exam-
ple prompts or further training. Our approach also demonstrates
robust cross-dataset transfer capabilities. Figure 4 illustrates that
both GraphWiz maintains a higher level of accuracy compared with
GPT-3.5, underscoring the effectiveness of our methodology across
datasets with varying distributions.
Comparison with GNNs. GNNs have competitive results on
simple graph binary classification tasks like Cycle, Bipartite, and
Connectivity. However, as task complexity increases, requiring

multi-step numerical reasoning, GNNs’ performance markedly de-
clines compared to GraphWiz . Beyond the results, we highlight
three fundamental differences between GNNs and GraphWiz : (1)
Unification : GNNs require separate training for each task, often ne-
cessitating distinct model structures to accommodate different task
inputs. In contrast, a single GraphWiz model is capable of handling
all tasks effectively. (2) Generalization. GraphWiz has the potential
to perform zero-shot task transfer: train on some tasks and test
on other tasks, a capability absent in GNNs. (3) Explainability. Al-
though both models perform similarly on simple tasks such as cycle
detection, GraphWiz offers added value by providing step-by-step
solutions and identifying specific locations of the cycle, thereby
enhancing its explainability. While combining GNNs and LLMs may
offer mutual benefits, it also introduces new challenges in model
design and joint training. Addressing these challenges in solving
graph computational problems remains an area for future work.
4.3 Results of GraphWiz with Reasoning Path
Increasing (RQ2)
Table 5 illustrates the average performance of two variants of
GraphWiz , Mistral 7B and LLaMA 2-7B, across various task cat-
egories. Detailed task results are provided in the Appendix, Table 8.
The performance metrics consider varying ratios of graph to rea-
soning path (G:R), which represent the data volume and diversity
of reasoning paths employed during training. Across all tasks, both
models exhibit consistent performance enhancements in correla-
tion with an expanded training corpus. This trend suggests that a
greater variety of reasoning paths typically boosts model efficacy
across graph-based problems.
Nevertheless, specific tasks such as Triangle Sum and Hamil-
ton Path display negligible or even reduced accuracy improve-
ments with larger data volumes. For instance, the accuracy for
GraphWiz (Mistral-7B) in the Triangle Sum task declines from
47.00% at a 1:1 ratio to 38.75% at a 1:5 ratio, potentially indicat-
ing issues such as overfitting where the model excessively learns
specific training data patterns at the expense of generalization to
new problems. This observation underscores the importance of
careful monitoring and validation during model training to ensure
broad applicability and effectiveness.

GPT-4 GraphWiz (Mistral 7B)Figure 6: Performance of GPT-4 (2 shot) and GraphWiz based
on Mistral 7B with different graph sizes (nodes range) on
two tasks. In this work, we use the number of nodes as an
indicator of graph complexity.
Furthermore, theG:Rratios in tasks such as Maximum Flow do
not strictly conform to anticipated increments like 1:2 or 1:3. Specif-
ically, in the Maximum Flow task, the GraphInstruct dataset records
aG:Rratio below 1:2 (see Table 2). Despite these deviations, both
models can exhibit improved performance in this task, indicating
that data volume increases in certain tasks might impact results in
others. This suggests the potential for cross-task learning, where
models apply reasoning paths learned from one task to enhance
performance on another, even without a proportional increase in
the data volume for the latter.
4.4 Transferability of GraphWiz (RQ3)
To explore the transferability of GraphWiz , we establish an addi-
tional model variant to explore this aspect: GraphWiz -High. This
model is trained exclusively on two high-complexity (NP-Complete)
graph tasks: Hamilton Path and Subgraph Matching. To investigate
its transferability, we conduct two comparative experiments:
Comparison on High-Complexity Tasks. We first compare
GraphWiz -High with the regular GraphWiz on high-complexity
tasks. Figure 5 (a) indicates that GraphWiz performs better, vali-
dating the effectiveness of mixed-task training. This outcome also
suggests that the model is capable of transferring skills learned
from other tasks to specific high-complexity tasks.
Zero-Shot Transfer Capability. We further test the zero-shot
transfer capability of GraphWiz -High on low and medium-complexity
tasks it has never been trained on. As can be seen from Figure 5 (b),
GraphWiz -High shows a significant performance improvement com-
pared to the Mistral-7B backbone. Even when compared to GPT-3.5,
our model managed to maintain comparable performance. Con-
sidering the vast difference in the number of parameters between
GPT-3.5 and GraphWiz -High, this indicates that ours possesses a
commendable ability to generalize across tasks.
4.5 Results of GraphWiz with Increasing
Problem Complexity (RQ4)
To address the questions regarding how the model’s performance
varies with different graph sizes and to figure out the largest graph
size the model can effectively solve, we present Figure 6 showcasing
the performance of the GraphWiz model on the best-performing

task (a) Cycle Detection, and the most challenging tasks (b) Short-
est Path. From the figure, we draw the following conclusions: (1)
Both GraphWiz and GPT-4 exhibit a decrease in performance as the
size of the graph increases. However, our model consistently out-
performs GPT-4 across most graph sizes, indicating a more robust
understanding and processing of graph structures. (2) We observe
that the performance on the latter task, Shortest Path, needs im-
provement, with a notable decline as the number of nodes increases.
This decline can likely be attributed to two main factors: The latter
tasks demand high reasoning and memory capabilities as higher
time complexity, as well as strong computational skills, which may
pose an additional challenge to the models’ capacities; Experimen-
tally, we find that both models primarily rely on enumeration to
arrive at solutions. Consequently, as the graph size enlarges, the
required enumerative reasoning grows exponentially, leading to a
significant drop in accuracy when the number of nodes exceeds 60,
after which they exhibit almost no accuracy.
These observations suggest that while GraphWiz shows a clear
advantage over GPT-4 in handling graph-related tasks, there is
a upper bound of complexity—particularly evident in tasks that
require numerical computation—at which the performance of even
the most advanced models starts to diminish significantly.
4.6 Sensitivity Analysis (RQ5)
We perform sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of
hyperparameter 𝛽onGraphWiz . Figure 7 present the average per-
formance of our models based on LLaMA 2-7B and 13B versions in
easy, medium andhard tasks. The results indicate that the optimal
value of𝛽varies depending on the task difficulty and the model
size. A higher 𝛽seems to favor performance on Hard tasks to some
extent, but this is not a strictly linear relationship and does not
hold consistently across different model sizes. This study highlights
the importance of hyperparameter tuning in achieving the best
possible model performance across a range of tasks. The analysis
suggests that careful tuning of 𝛽is necessary to achieve the best
trade-off performances.
4.7 Case Study
In this subsection, we present a case study of a complex cycle detec-
tion problem that involves an undirected graph with 89 nodes in
Figure 8, a scale that poses substantial challenges even for human
solvers. For a human to detect a cycle in such an extensive graph
would require external aids or substantial time, as it is impractical

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
GPT -4: No, there is no cycle in this graph.  ×
GraphWiz : There are many possible ways to find a cycle in this graph, but one example is: Starting 
from node 0, we can go to node 73 (via edge 0 -73), then to node 82 (via edge 73 -82), then to node 44 
(via edge 82 -44), then to node 17 (via edge 44 -17), then to node 36 (via edge 17 -36), then to node 28 
(via edge 36 -28), and back to node 0 (via edge 28 -0). This forms a cycle [ 0-73-82-44-17-36-28-0] 
without revisiting any edge. So, there is a cycle in this graph. √Figure 8: A typical case of GraphWiz and GPT-4.
to resolve purely through mental computation. We could observe
that GPT-4 outputs a very short incorrect answer, which could
arise from the model’s constraints in processing long inputs or
from an erroneous interpretation of the graph’s intricate structure.
This limitation reflects the challenges that conventional LLMs en-
counter when adapting to graph-theoretic problems. In contrast,
GraphWiz correctly detects a cycle, providing a clear and detailed
reasoning path. This demonstration of GraphWiz ’s spatial reason-
ing and memory retention capabilities is significant. It indicates
that the model has effectively internalized the principles of graph
theory to the extent that it can autonomously navigate through and
reason about large-scale and complex graph structures. This case
study is a testament to the feasibility of employing GraphWiz for
sophisticated graph problems. The model’s ability to accurately
resolve such complex tasks suggests it has substantial practical ap-
plications, offering a robust tool for researchers and practitioners.
5 CONCLUSION
This paper tackles the challenge of equipping LLMs not only to
process but to reason explicitly on a variety of graph computational
problems. We introduce GraphInstruct, a novel instruction-tuning
dataset encompassing a broad spectrum of graph problems, de-
signed to enhance the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of
LLMs. We subsequently fine-tune open-source LLMs on this dataset,
notably from the LLaMA 2 and Mistral series, leading to the creation
ofGraphWiz . This model not only surpasses GPT-4 in performance
but also showcases the potential for cross-task transferability of
reasoning skills. Our experimental analysis highlights the critical
balance needed in training volume to maximize model effectiveness
and proposes a promising direction on cross-task transfer learning.
Future endeavors will focus on devising more efficient model ar-
chitectures and training methods to further improve GraphWiz ’s
performance and generalization capabilities.

Graph Computational Problems KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
A TASK DEFINITION
In this section, we provide a detailed definition of each task in our
GraphInstruct benchmark. For binary classification tasks, we filter
the data to create a balanced set of graphs with both positive and
negative labels.
•Task 1: Cycle Detection. In an undirected graph G={V,E},
the task is to detect the existence of a cycle. A cycle can be defined
as a sequence of vertices 𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑘with𝑘≥3, that forms a
closed loop, meaning 𝑣1=𝑣𝑘. Additionally, for all 1≤𝑖<𝑘,
each vertex 𝑣𝑖must be distinct from the others, and there must
be an edge connecting 𝑣𝑖to𝑣𝑖+1.
•Task 2: Connectivity. Given an undirected graph G={V,E},
the task is to assess if two randomly chosen nodes 𝑢and𝑣are
connected through a sequence of edges.
•Task 3: Bipartite Graph Check. This task is to determine if
a directed graphG={V,E}is bipartite. A graph is considered
bipartite if its nodes can be split into two distinct sets UandV
such that no two nodes within the same set are adjacent.
•Task 4: Topological Sort. The task entails finding a valid topo-
logical sort of a directed graph G={V,E}. In a topological sort,
nodes are linearly ordered such that for each directed edge (𝑢,𝑣)
from node𝑢to node𝑣, the node𝑢is positioned before 𝑣in the
sequence.
•Task 5: Shortest Path. The task requires identifying the shortest
path between two nodes in an undirected, weighted graph G=
{V,E,𝑤}, where𝑤:E → R+assigns a positive weight to
each edge. The goal is to find a path connecting the two nodes
such that the total sum of the edge weights along this path is
minimized.
•Task 6: Maximum Triangle Sum. Given an undirected, weighted
graphG={V,E,𝑙}, where𝑙:V→ R+is a function assigning a
positive weight to each node, the task involves finding a triangle,
a cycle of three connected vertices (𝑣1,𝑣2,𝑣3), that maximizes
the weight sum 𝑙(𝑣1)+𝑙(𝑣2)+𝑙(𝑣3).
•Task 7: Maximum Flow. Consider a directed, weighted graph
G={V,E,𝑐}, where𝑐:E → R+is a function assigning a
positive capacity to each edge, representing the maximum flowthat the edge can support. Given a source node 𝑣𝑠and a sink
node𝑣𝑡inG, the task is to devise a plan to maximize the flow
from the source 𝑠to the sink𝑡.
•Task 8: Hamilton Path. This task is to determine whether
there is a Hamilton path in an undirected graph G={V,E}. A
Hamilton path is defined as a path that traverses each node in
the graph exactly once.
•Task 9: Substructure Matching. Given two graphs, GandG′,
whereG={V,E}andG′={V′,E′}, the task is to determine
whether there exists a subgraph within Gthat is isomorphic to
G′.
B ADDITIONAL DATASET INFORMATION
Table 7 shows the detailed statistics of our DPO training corpus.
Table 6 shows the training and testing instruction of our model. Due
to the space limit, we only keep all task prompts used for testing
GPT-4 and ChatGPT in our GitHub Repository.
C ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS
Results on other graph types. GraphWiz is primarily trained on
Erdős-Rényi (ER) graphs due to their representation as general ran-
dom graphs. To evaluate the generalization ability of GraphWiz , we
tested it on the Barabási–Albert (BA) model, Path graph, Star graph,
and Complete graph. Each graph type included 200 examples for
each of the six tasks (Cycle, Connectivity, Bipartite, Hamilton, Short-
est, and Flow). The results demonstrate that GraphWiz -Mistral-7B
achieves an average accuracy of 68.12% on BA graphs, 54.48% on
Path graphs, 63.17% on Star graphs, and 83.33% on Complete graphs,
all of which outperform the 47.93% accuracy on ER graphs. These
findings indicate that GraphWiz trained on ER graphs can effec-
tively generalize to other graph types. Notably, GraphWiz achieves
100% accuracy on the Cycle, Connectivity, and Bipartite tasks for
Complete graphs.
Effect on the number of reasoning paths. As shown in Table
5, Table 8 provides detailed results of our model’s performance on
each task as the ratio of the graph to reasoning paths increases.
