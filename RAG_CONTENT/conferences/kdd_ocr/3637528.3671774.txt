ABSTRACT
Label noise is a common challenge in large datasets, as it can signif-
icantly degrade the generalization ability of deep neural networks.
Most existing studies focus on noisy labels in computer vision;
however, graph models encompass both node features and graph
topology as input, and become more susceptible to label noise
through message-passing mechanisms. Recently, only a few works
have been proposed to tackle the label noise on graphs. One sig-
nificant limitation is that they operate under the assumption that
the graph exhibits homophily and that the labels are distributed
smoothly. However, real-world graphs can exhibit varying degrees
of heterophily, or even be dominated by heterophily, which results
in the inadequacy of the current methods.
In this paper, we study graph label noise in the context of ar-
bitrary heterophily, with the aim of rectifying noisy labels and
assigning labels to previously unlabeled nodes. We begin by con-
ducting two empirical analyses to explore the impact of graph
homophily on graph label noise. Following observations, we pro-
pose a efficient algorithm, denoted as 𝑅2LP. Specifically, 𝑅2LP is
an iterative algorithm with three steps: (1) reconstruct the graph
to recover the homophily property, (2) utilize label propagation
to rectify the noisy labels, (3) select high-confidence labels to re-
tain for the next iteration. By iterating these steps, we obtain a
set of “correct” labels, ultimately achieving high accuracy in the
node classification task. The theoretical analysis is also provided to
demonstrate its remarkable denoising effect. Finally, we perform
experiments on ten benchmark datasets with different levels of
graph heterophily and various types of noise. In these experiments,
we compare the performance of 𝑅2LP against ten typical baseline
methods. Our results illustrate the superior performance of the
proposed𝑅2LP. The code and data of this paper can be accessed at:

1 INTRODUCTION
Graphs are ubiquitous in the real world, such as social networks [ 14],
biomolecular structures [ 37] and knowledge graphs [ 9]. In graphs,
nodes and edges represent entities and their relationships respec-
tively. To enrich the information of graphs, each node is usually
associated with a descriptive label. For example, each user in Face-
book has interest as its label. Recently, to learn from graphs, graph
neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success, which
can seamlessly integrate node features with graph structure to learn
node representations. GNNs generally adopt the message passing
strategy to aggregate information from nodes’ neighbors and then
update node representations. After that, the learned representations
are fed into various downstream tasks, such as node classification.
Despite their great performance, GNNs still encounter challenges
from label noise, which is a pervasive issue in real-world datasets.
For example, non-expert sources like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
and web pages can be used to collect labels, which could uninten-
tionally lead to unreliable labels and noise. It is well known that
deep neural networks are very sensitive to noise, thereby degrading
their generalization ability [ 33]. To address the problem, there have
been a majority of neural network models [ 10,18,20,31] proposed
in the field of computer vision (CV) to tackle label noise in images.
Unfortunately, we cannot directly apply these approaches to graph-
structured data as graphs are non-Euclidean data types. Therefore,
exploring the issue of graph label noise is highly necessary.
Recently, very few works have been proposed to deal with graph
label noise [ 4,29]. These models still attenuate graph label noise

based on an explicit homophily assumption that linked nodes in a
graph are more likely to be with the same label. However, ho-
mophily is not a universal principle in the real world. In fact,
graph datasets often exhibit varying degrees of homophily, and
may even be heterophily-dominated. Methods based on the ho-
mophily assumption evidently cannot handle these heterophilous
graphs. As shown in Figure 1, we compare the performance of GCN,
H2GCN [ 35] and GloGNN [ 16], which are specially designed for
homophilous and heterophilous graphs, against two state-of-the-art
methods for graph label noise, LPM [ 29] and NRGNN [ 4], on the
heterophilous benchmark dataset Cornell andActor with flip noise1
ranging from 0% to 60%. The results indicate that on heterophilous
graphs, current methods for label noise (LPM and NRGNN), are still
underperformed by GNN models designed for graph heterophily
(H2GCN and GloGNN). The problem of graph label noise deserves
further investigation.
In this paper, we study graph label noise in the context of ar-
bitrary heterophily, with the aim of rectifying noisy labels and
assigning labels to previously unlabeled nodes. We first explore the
impact of graph homophily on graph label noise by conducting a
series of experiments on benchmark heterophilous datasets. Specif-
ically, we manipulate graph homophily by graph reconstruction
to see if existing methods could improve their classification per-
formance against label noise. The observations demonstrate that a
high graph homophily rate can indeed mitigate the effect of graph
label noise on GNN performance. In addition, we find that label
propagation (LP) [ 36] based methods achieve great performance as
graph homophily increases.
These inspirations led us to propose a effective algorithm, 𝑅2LP,
incorporating graph Reconstruction for homophily and noisy label
Rectification by Label Propagation. We further refine this basic
solution in several aspects. In terms of effectiveness, we implement
a multi-round selection process as opposed to correcting noisy
labels all at once. Specifically, we select high-confidence noisy labels
to augment the correct label set, and then repeat the algorithm,
achieving higher accuracy. With respect to efficiency, we reduce
the time complexity to linear time by unifying the computation of
graph construction and label propagation. Ultimately, we provide
a theoretical proof of 𝑅2LP, illustrating its impressive denoising
effect in addressing graph label noise.
To summarize, our main contributions are:
1Flip noise and uniform noise are explained in Section 6.1.•Empirical Analysis: We first investigate the influence of graph
homophily on label noise through the manipulation of homophily
levels and noise ratios within real-world datasets. Moreover, we
incorporate three common homophilous graph reconstruction mod-
ules into existing approaches, to evaluate the performance improve-
ment of these approaches in heterophilous graphs.
•Algorithm Design and Theoretical Proof: Based on empirical
observations, we propose a effective algorithm 𝑅2LP to deal with
the issue of graph label noise. Specifically, 𝑅2LP is an iterative
algorithm with three steps: (1) reconstruct the graph to recover
the homophily property, (2) utilize label propagation to correct
the noisy labels, (3) select high-confidence corrected labels and
add them to the clean label set to retain for the next iteration. By
repeating these steps, we obtain a set of “correct” labels to achieve
accurate node classification. We also provide a theoretical analysis
of the denoising effect of 𝑅2LP.
•Extensive Experiments: We conduct extensive experiments on
two homophilous datasets and eight heterophilous datasets with
varying noise types and ratios. Our proposed 𝑅2LP outperforms
baselines in the majority of cases, demonstrating the superior per-
formance of 𝑅2LP. The ablation studies are also done to verify the
necessity of each component of 𝑅2LP.
2 PRELIMINARIES
Problem Definition. We consider the semi-supervised node classi-
fication task in an undirected graph G=(V,E)whereV={𝑣𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1
is a set of nodes and E⊆V×V is a set of edges. Let the label set
asYwith𝑐classes, andV=C∪N∪U , whereCis set of labeled
nodes with clean labels 𝑌C,Nis a set of labeled nodes with noise
labels𝑌NandUis set of unlabeled nodes. In the paper, 𝑌Cdenotes
the set of known clean labels, while 𝑌Nrepresents the collection
containing a certain proportion of noisy labels. Both of them are
given as inputs. It is unknown which labels in 𝑌Nare erroneous.
Let𝐴be the adjacency matrix of Gsuch that𝐴𝑖𝑗=1if there exists
an edge between nodes 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗; 0, otherwise. For the initial node
feature matrix, we denote it as 𝑋. Our goal is to design an effective
algorithm to predict the class label for noisy and unlabeled nodes.
GNN and Label Propagation Basics. Most graph neural networks
follow the message-passing mechanism, which consists of two main
steps: aggregation and update. GNNs first aggregate information
from neighboring nodes ˆℎ(𝑙)
𝑖=AGGREGATE(ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑗,∀𝑣𝑗∈N𝑖),
and then update each node embeddings ℎ(𝑙)
𝑖=UPDATE(ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑖,ˆℎ(𝑙)
𝑖).
After𝐿aggregations, the final node embedding 𝐻(𝐿)is obtained
and then fed into a softmax layer to generate probability logits for
label prediction. Different from GNNs, label propagation directly
aggregates the labels from neighboring nodes through the formula
𝑌(𝑙)
𝑖=(1−𝛼)·𝑌(𝑙−1)
𝑖+𝛼·AGGREGATE(𝑌(𝑙−1)
𝑗,∀𝑣𝑗∈N𝑖). It con-
verges when labels do not change significantly between iterations.
Depending on the various utilization of labels, the robustness of
GNNs and LP to graph label noise is also different.

LABEL NOISE?
In this section, we investigate the potential of mitigating the effect
of graph label noise by decreasing the graph heterophily rate. To do

Figure 2: The impact of edge homophily on graph label noise across various methods (flip noise)
this, we first outline existing approaches for graph label noise. Next,
we introduce three graph reconstruction modules to transform the
original graphs into homophilous ones. Ultimately, we modify the
graph structure in heterophilous datasets through two manipula-
tions: (1) converting the heterophilous edges into homophilous
ones based on the ground-truth labels and (2) reconstructing the
homophilous graph. We then apply the existing approaches to the
modified datasets and several critical observations are derived from
these experiments.
3.1 Existing Approaches
Here we introduce two state-of-the-art methods for graph label
noise, LPM [29] and NRGNN [4].
•LPM is proposed to tackle graph label noise by combining label
propagation and meta-learning. It consists of three modules: a GNN
for feature extraction, LP for pseudo-label generation and an aggre-
gation network for merging labels. Initially, the similarity matrix
𝐴′
𝑖𝑗=𝐴𝑖𝑗
𝑑(ℎ𝑖,ℎ𝑗)+𝜏is calculated based on the adjacency matrix 𝐴and
the node embeddings ℎ𝑖andℎ𝑗. These embeddings are learned
by the GNN feature extraction. The function 𝑑(·,·)represents a
distance measure, and 𝜏is an infinitesimal constant. Then LP is
performed on 𝐴′to generate pseudo-labels. Lastly, the aggregation
network is used to integrate the original labels and pseudo-labels,
resulting in the final labels through meta-learning.
•NRGNN is also designed to deal with graph label noise and label
sparsity, including three modules: an edge predictor, a pseudo-label
predictor, and a GNN classifier. The edge predictor first generates
extra edges to connect similar labeled and unlabeled nodes by the
link prediction task. As a result, the newly generated adjacency ma-
trix𝐴′becomes denser. Then the pseudo-label predictor estimates
pseudo-labels 𝑌′for unlabeled nodes. The GNN classifier outputs
the final predictions based on the updated 𝐴′and𝑌′.Formally, the overall process of these two methods can be for-
mulated into three steps:
𝐴′=𝑓reconstruct(𝐴,𝑋),
𝑌′=𝑓pseudo-label(𝑌,𝐴′),
𝑌final=𝑓predict(𝑋,𝐴′,𝑌,𝑌′).(1)
Note that both LPM and NRGNN depend on the graph homophily
assumption. Further, they mainly concentrate on pseudo-label gen-
eration, while overlooking the correction of noisy labels.
3.2 Graph Reconstruction with Homophily
While both LPM and NRGNN reconstruct the original graph, their
methods have clear limitations. For LPM, it only adjusts the weights
of raw edges in the graph, which cannot add new edges. Further,
NRGNN employs link prediction as objective to predict new edges,
which takes existing edges in the graph as positive samples. This
restricts its wide applicability in graphs with heterophily. Therefore,
we next introduce three common methods to convert heterophilous
graphs into homophilous ones.
First, the primary goal is to directly construct a similarity matrix
that serves as the homophilous graph. Specifically, we train a GNN
𝑓(·)to aggregate node features and topological structure, and ob-
tain the hidden representation ℎ𝑖for node𝑣𝑖. We then proceed to
calculate the distance between nodes by utilizing the cosine simi-
larity metric. The existence of edge 𝑍𝑖𝑗between nodes 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗is
decided by a fixed threshold 𝜖:
𝑍𝑖𝑗=1if distance(ℎ𝑖,ℎ𝑗)<𝜖; 0,otherwise (2)
This method can be considered as a direct extension to the one used
by LPM. On the one hand, both methods compute the similarity
between nodes based on node embddings learned by GNN. On the
other hand, our method can further add new edges into the graph,
while LPM cannot.

The second option is to learn a new graph adjacency matrix. The
representative method is GloGNN [ 16], which learns the hidden
representation 𝐻for nodes and the new homophilous graph 𝑍
together. Specifically, in the 𝑙-th layer, it aims to obtain a coefficient
matrix𝑍(𝑙)∈R𝑛×𝑛and node embeddings 𝐻(𝑙)∈R𝑛×𝑑satisfying
𝐻(𝑙)≈𝑍(𝑙)𝐻(𝑙). Each element 𝑍(𝑙)
𝑖𝑗represents how well node 𝑣𝑗
characterizes node 𝑣𝑖. The objective is formulated as:

where𝛽1and𝛽2are two hyper-parameters to control term im-
portance.𝐻(0)could be a simple transformation of initial node
features𝑋and adjacency matrix 𝐴(e.g., MLP(Concat(𝑋,𝐴))), and
𝛾is to balance the importance of initial and current embeddings.
ˆ𝐴𝑘denotes the 𝑘-hop sub-graph, and 𝐾is the pre-set maximum
hop count. Equation 3 has a closed-form solution:

Here,𝑍(𝑙)∗characterizes the connections between nodes. After 𝐿
layers, we use 𝑍(𝐿)∗to denote homophilous graph structure.
In the third option, 𝑍(𝐿)∗can be further adjusted to be symmetric
and non-negative. Formally, we add the following formula after
the calculation of Equation 4, and still optimize the objective in
Equation 3:
ˆ𝑍(𝐿)=ReLU(1
2(𝑍(𝐿)∗+(𝑍(𝐿)∗)T). (5)
3.3 Empirical Analysis
We next investigate the relationship between graph homophily
and graph label noise using two types of empirical experiments. In
the first experiment, we directly enhance the homophily level by
converting heterophilous edges into homophilous ones based on
the ground-truth labels, and then run existing methods to compare
their performance. In the second experiment, we integrate thethree homophilous graph reconstruction modules with existing
approaches and evaluate them in heterophilous datasets.
3.3.1 Graph Homophily Mitigates the Effect of Graph Label Noise.
We modified the edge homophily level and label noise level on two
real-world heterophilous datasets, Chameleon andActor. In order
to maintain the same sparsity of the dataset, we randomly replace
a heterophilous edge in the original graph with a homophilous
one. We conducted experiments on four methods, including two
classical methods: LP and GCN; and two SOTA methods for graph
label noise: NRGNN and LPM. Figure 2 shows the performance of
all the methods under different levels of flip label noise.
From the figures, we observe that: (1) For all the methods and
noise rates, the classification accuracy consistently improves with
the increase of graph homophily on both Chameleon and Actor
datasets. Surprisingly, when graph homophily gets larger, even
under a high noise rate (e.g., 0.6 for LP, NRGNN and LPM, 0.4 for
GCN), these methods can still achieve better performance than their
corresponding results in the original heterophilous graph without
label noise. This indicates that graph homophily can effectively
mitigate the negative impact of label noise. (2) When the noise
rate is 0.6, GCN performs poorly, while LP can still achieve the
best results among all the methods in some cases. This shows that
although both GCN and LP apply the smoothing operation on
node features and labels, respectively, GCN is adversely affected by
the coupling of node features and learnable transformation matrix,
which is also pointed out in [ 13]. This insight also demonstrates that
LP excels at correcting noisy labels through label smoothing under
various conditions of graph homophily. We will give theoretical
proofs in Sec. 4.4 later. To sum up, all the results empirically show
that graph homophily plays a significant role in denoising labels.
3.3.2 Integration of Homophilous Graph Reconstruction and Exist-
ing Approaches. In the previous section, we show the importance
of graph homophily. However, the experiments use ground-truth
labels to change the level of graph homophily, which is not practical.
Instead, we adapt three kinds of reconstruction modules (denoted
asR1,R2andR3) as introduced in Sec. 3.2 to LPM and NRGNN,
and evaluate their performance in two heterophilous datasets under
 
436Resurrecting Label Propagation for Graphs with Heterophily and Label Noise KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
different noise ratios. In detail, we directly replace the computation
of𝐴′, and keep𝑌′and𝑌finalunchanged for LPM and NRGNN in
Equation 1. For different reconstruction modules (R1, R2andR3),
𝐴′is replaced by 𝑍in Equation 2, 𝑍(𝐿)∗in Equation 4, or ˆ𝑍(𝐿)in
Equation 5. Figure 3 summarizes the results of all the variants.
From the figures, we see that (1) The replacement of homophilous
graph reconstruction modules can generally improve the perfor-
mance of LPM and NRGNN in heterophilous datasets. (2) The re-
construction module R1, which is based on cosine similarity, only
considers node representations learned by the GNN model, and
employs a hard threshold to determine the existence of edges. It
heavily relies on the selected GNN and the pre-set threshold. Con-
sequently, it cannot provide consistent improvement for both LPM
and NRGNN. (3) The reconstruction modules R2andR3can clearly
enhance the performance of LPM and NRGNN. This is because they
directly learn the graph structure. Interestingly, the overall perfor-
mance of R2surpasses that of R3, suggesting that 𝑍derived in a
closed-form solution can better capture the true relations between
nodes. To summarize, incorporating graph reconstruction with
homophily can effectively enhance existing approaches for graph
noise labels. Among the tested modules, the second reconstruc-
tion module computed by Equation 4 demonstrates the best overall
performance. We will employ it in our following experiments.
4𝑅2LP: GRAPH RECONSTRUCTION AND
NOISY LABEL RECTIFICATION BY LABEL
PROPAGATION
Based on the above empirical analysis, we have identified two
key findings. First, graph homophily can mitigate the effect of
graph label noise. Second, label propagation is a simple yet effective
approach to rectify incorrect labels when graph homophily is high.
These findings inspire us to utilize homophily graph reconstruction
and label propagation, and propose a new approach 𝑅2LP against
arbitrary heterophily and label noise.

4.1 Basic version
Assume we have a graph Gwith arbitrary heterophily, and a set
of clean labels 𝑌Cand noisy labels 𝑌N. Our goal is to obtain the
correct labels for both noisy and unlabeled nodes. As previously
designed, we first reconstruct the graph structure explicitly andcompute the matrix 𝑍(𝐿)∗by Equation 4. Simultaneously, the node
representation 𝐻(𝐿)is obtained. The training of the reconstruction
module relies on the clean labels 𝑌C, which allows us to establish
a mapping from 𝐻(𝐿)to𝑌to generate the predicted labels 𝑌Pfor
all unlabeled nodes. While 𝑌Pis noisy, it still contains rich correct
labels that are useful in label propagation.
Label propagation [ 34,36] is a graph-based method to propagate
label information across connected nodes. The fundamental assump-
tion of LP is label smoothness, which posits that two connected
nodes tend to share the same label. Thus, propagating existing
labeled data (including clean/noisy/predicted labels) throughout
the graph can effectively help us rectify noisy labels and assign
appropriate labels to previously unlabeled nodes.
Here we set the similarity graph 𝑆=𝑍(𝐿)∗, and𝐹∈R𝑛×𝑐as the
soft label matrix for nodes. When 𝑡=0, we establish the initial label
matrix𝐹(0)=𝛼2𝑌C+𝛼3𝑌N+𝛼4𝑌P. Note that in addition to the
clean labels 𝑌C, both𝑌Nand𝑌Pcould be noise-corrupted. Hence,
we introduce three hyper-parameters 𝛼2,𝛼3and𝛼4to control the
reliability of these initial labels. After that, in the 𝑡-th iteration, LP
can be formulated as:
𝐹(𝑡+1)=𝛼1𝑆𝐹(𝑡)+𝛼2𝑌C+𝛼3𝑌N+𝛼4𝑌P, (6)
whereÍ4
𝑗=1𝛼𝑗=1and each𝛼𝑗∈[0,1]. With iterations in Equa-
tion 6, we derive:
𝐹(𝑡)=(𝛼1𝑆)𝑡−1𝐹(0)+𝛼2𝑡−1∑︁
𝑖=0(𝛼1𝑆)𝑖𝑌C+𝛼3𝑡−1∑︁
𝑖=0(𝛼1𝑆)𝑖𝑌N+𝛼4𝑡−1∑︁
𝑖=0(𝛼1𝑆)𝑖𝑌P.
(7)
Hence, we can also have a closed-form solution:
𝐹∗=lim𝑡→∞𝐹(𝑡)=(𝐼−𝛼1𝑆)−1(𝛼2𝑌C+𝛼3𝑌N+𝛼4𝑌P).(8)
4.2 Efficiency Improvement
Directly calculating 𝐹∗by Equation 8 is computationally infeasible
due to the cubic time complexity involved in computing 𝑍(𝐿)∗
in Equation 4 and the inverse term (𝐼−𝛼1𝑆)−1. However, even
quadratic time complexity is still high for large graph datasets.
Therefore, we aim to accelerate the whole computation to achieve
linear time complexity.
First of all, we utilize the Woodbury formula [ 25] to replace the
inverse and transform Equation 4 into:
𝑍(𝑙)∗="
(1−𝛾)𝐻(𝑙)(𝐻(𝑙))T+𝛽2𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝜆𝑘ˆ𝐴𝑘−𝛾(1−𝛾)𝐻(0)(𝐻(𝑙))T#

(𝛽1+𝛽2)2𝐻(𝑙)1
(1−𝛾)2𝐼𝑑+1
𝛽1+𝛽2(𝐻(𝑙))T𝐻(𝑙)−1
(𝐻(𝑙))T#
(9)
After that, we use first-order Taylor expansion and derive
𝐹∗=(𝐼−𝛼1𝑆)−1𝐹(0)≈(𝐼+𝛼1𝑆)𝐹(0). (10)
The inverse term in Equation 9 is computed on a matrix in R𝑑×𝑑,
whose time complexity is only 𝑂(𝑑3). In this way, the overall time
complexity of computing 𝑍(𝐿)∗is𝑂(𝑛2), leading to a quadratic

·[1
(1−𝛾)2𝐼𝑑+1
𝛽1+𝛽2(𝐻(𝐿))T𝐻(𝐿)]−1(𝐻(𝐿))T𝐹(0).
(12)
In this way, we avoid computing 𝑍(𝑙)∗and(𝐼+𝛼1𝑆)explicitly,
and it can be further accelerated by matrix multiplication reorder-
ing. We first calculate 𝑄in a right-to-left manner. Due to the time
complexity𝑂(𝑑3)of computing the inverse term, the overall time
complexity of calculating 𝑄is𝑂(𝑛𝑐𝑑+𝑑3), where𝑐𝑑≪𝑛in the
large datasets. After that, we calculate 𝐹∗in Equation 11 in a simi-
lar right-to-left manner. For example, for the term 𝐻(0)(𝐻(𝐿))T𝑄,
we first compute(𝐻(𝐿))T𝑄. Then we left-multiply the result with
𝐻(0), leading to a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛𝑐𝑑). When computing the
termÍ𝐾
𝑘−1𝜆𝑘ˆ𝐴𝑘𝑄, we first calculate ˆ𝐴𝑄. Due to the sparsity of ˆ𝐴,
the time complexity is 𝑂(𝑝𝑐𝑛), where𝑝is the average number of
non-zero entries in each row of ˆ𝐴. The total time complexity forÍ𝐾
𝑘−1𝜆𝑘ˆ𝐴𝑘𝑄is𝑂(𝐾𝑝𝑐𝑛), where𝐾𝑝𝑐 is a coefficient. Finally, we
approximate the optimal label propagation results in a linear time.
4.3 Effectiveness Enhancement
To further enhance the effectiveness of 𝑅2LP, we employ a multi-
round selection strategy. Specifically, 𝐹∗is obtained after the com-
putation of graph reconstruction and label propagation. We then
calculate the confidence based on 𝐹∗for noisy nodes, select the
rectified nodes with the highest confidence and add them to the
clean label set 𝑌C. In each time, 𝜀∗|N| nodes are chosen, where 𝜀
is the pre-set ratio. The updated clean label set can be leveraged in
the next round to reconstruct the graph and refine the remaining
nodes. Finally, we obtain an augmented clean label set, upon which
we train a GNN classifier to obtain the node classification result.
The pseudo-code of 𝑅2LP is provided in Algorithm 1.
The input is a graph with the topology 𝐴and node features
𝑋, and we divide the nodes into three sets C,NandU. Here,C
represents clean labeled nodes, Ndenotes noisy labeled nodes, and
Urepresents unlabeled nodes. We have the labels 𝑌Cand𝑌N, and
we aim to predict 𝑌U. The whole process is a multi-round training
to select the noisy nodes with corrected labels into the clean node
setC. In each round, we first reconstruct the graph with homophily
based on the current clean labels, and train a GNN to obtain the
predicted labels for all the nodes as extra information. Next, we
employ label propagation to rectify noisy labels. Given the selection
ratio𝜀, we select a portion of the current noisy nodes based on the
confidence of 𝐹∗. Lastly, we transfer the selected noisy nodes with
their corrected labels from NtoCand initiate a new round. 𝑅2LP
typically runs for 10-20 iterations. After we end all the rounds, we
obtain the final clean set Cto train a GNN and predict the labels
for unlabeled nodes.
4.4 Theoretical Verification
In this section, we theoretically analyze the denoising effect of
label propagation. For clarity, we first assume the clean label is
corrupted by a noise transition matrix 𝑻∈[0,1]𝑐×𝑐, where 𝑻𝑖𝑗=
P(˜𝑌=𝐶𝑗|𝑌=𝐶𝑖)is the probability of the label 𝐶𝑖being corrupted
into the label 𝐶𝑗. For simplicity and following [ 24], we assumethe classification is binary and the noise transition matrix is 𝑻=1−𝑒 𝑒
𝑒 1−𝑒
. After label propagation, the propagated label of the
node𝑣𝑖becomes a random variable
ˆ𝑌𝑖=(1−𝛼)˜𝑌𝑖+𝛼
𝑑∑︁
𝑣𝑗∈N𝑖˜𝑌𝑗. (13)
which is decided by its own noisy label ˜𝑌𝑖and its𝑑neighbors’ noisy
labels ˜𝑌𝑗. We establish the following theorem for the propagated
label ˆ𝑌𝑖, and the detailed proof can be found in our full version2.
Theorem 1. (Label Propagation and Denoising) Suppose the label
noise is generated by 𝑻and the label propagation follows Equation 13.
For a specific node 𝑖, we further assume the node has 𝑑neighbors, and
its neighbor nodes have the probability 𝑝to have the same true label
with node𝑖, i.e.,P[𝑌𝑖=𝑌𝑗]=𝑝. After one-round label propagation,
the gap between the propagated label and the ground-true label is:
E(𝑌−ˆ𝑌)2=P(𝑌=0)E(ˆ𝑌|𝑌=0)2
+P(𝑌=1)
E(ˆ𝑌|𝑌=1)−12
+Var(ˆ𝑌),(14)
where we have
E(ˆ𝑌|𝑌=0)=(1−𝛼)𝑒+𝛼[𝑝𝑒+(1−𝑝)(1−𝑒)], (15a)
E(ˆ𝑌|𝑌=1)=(1−𝛼)(1−𝑒)+𝛼[𝑝(1−𝑒)+(1−𝑝)𝑒], (15b)
Var(ˆ𝑌)=(1−𝛼)2𝑒(1−𝑒) (15c)
+𝛼2
𝑑[𝑝𝑒+(1−𝑝)(1−𝑒)][1−𝑝𝑒−(1−𝑝)(1−𝑒)].
(15d)
(1)Heterophily and the impact of 𝑝:In Equation 14, 𝑝plays
the central role as a larger 𝑝can reduce all three terms in the bound.
The value of 𝑝is related to the heterophily of a specific node and a
more heterophilous node tends to have a smaller 𝑝. This is our major
motivation to construct 𝑍(𝐿)∗in the algorithm, which attempts to
connect the nodes from the same class.
(2)Label denoising effect: We consider two special cases to
see the label denoising by propagation. When we set 𝛼=0and do
not propagate the labels, E(𝑌−ˆ𝑌)2=E(𝑌−˜𝑌)2=𝑒. When we
set𝑝→1where all the neighbors have the same true labels, we
haveE(𝑌−ˆ𝑌)2≈𝑒2+1
𝑑𝑒(1−𝑒), which is strictly less than 𝑒. It
demonstrates the importance of neighbors. Besides, when we have
more neighbors, the distance becomes smaller. It is the reason that
𝑍(𝐿)∗is dense so each node could have more neighbors.
(3)The impact of clean and predicted labels: The bound in
Equation 14 monotonically decreases with 𝑒and therefore having
clean nodes can substantially reduce the bound. When the pre-
dicted labels are present, we have a larger number of neighbors for
propagation, which also increases the value 𝑑.
In the following theorem, we analyze the generalization error of
the final GNN classifier ˆ𝑓.
Theorem 2. (Generalization Error and Oracle Inequality) Denote the
node feature 𝑋sampled from the distribution 𝐷, the graph topology
as𝐴, the set of training nodes as 𝑆𝑛, the graph neural network as
𝑓(·,·), and the learned GNN classifier ˆ𝑓=inf𝑓Í

Suppose that the propagated label concentrated on its mean, i.e., with

2,||ˆ𝑌−𝑌|−E|ˆ𝑌−𝑌||≤𝜖1. We further assume
the generalization error is bounded with respect to the propagated
labels, i.e., with probability at least𝛿
2,
E𝑋∼𝐷|ˆ𝑌−ˆ𝑓(𝑋,𝐴)|−inf
𝑓E𝑋∼𝐷|ˆ𝑌−𝑓(𝑋,𝐴)|≤𝜖2.
Then we obtain the generalization error bound for training with noisy
labels and test on the clean labels, i.e., with probability at least 𝛿, the
generalization error trained with propagated labels is given by
E𝑋∼𝐷|𝑌−ˆ𝑓(𝑋,𝐴)|≤ inf
𝑓E𝑋∼𝐷|𝑌−𝑓(𝑋,𝐴)|+𝜖2+2(E|ˆ𝑌−𝑌|+𝜖1).The generalization error mainly depends on 𝜖2andE|ˆ𝑌−𝑌|.
Our algorithm iteratively rectifies the noisy labels and selects high-
confidence labels into the clean set, thereby reducing E|ˆ𝑌−𝑌|. In
addition, as shown in [ 6], using the predicted labels generated by
the same neural network is able to decrease 𝜖2. This is the reason
for the inclusion of predicted labels within our algorithm.
5 RELATED WORK
5.1 Deep Learning with Noisy Labels
Dealing with noisy labels can be approached through two main-
stream directions: loss adjustment and sample selection [ 21]. Partic-
ularly, loss adjustment aims to mitigate the negative impact of noise
 
439KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yao Cheng et al.
by adjusting the loss value or the noisy labels. For example, [ 18] ex-
plicitly estimates the noise transition matrix to correct the forward
and backward loss. Other effective techniques, such as [ 10,20],
refurbish the noisy labels by a convex combination of noisy and
predicted labels. Sample selection, on the other hand, involves
selecting true-labeled examples from a noisy training set via multi-
network or multi-round learning. For instance, Co-teaching [ 8]
and Co-teaching+ [ 31] use multi-network training, where two deep
neural networks are maintained and each network selects a set
of small-loss examples and feeds them to its peer network. Multi-
round learning methods [ 20,28] iteratively refine the selected set
of clean samples by repeating the training rounds. As a result, the
performance improves as the number of clean samples increases.
5.2 Learning GNNs with Noisy Labels
Graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 7,12,13,23,26,30] have emerged
as revolutionary technologies for graph-structured data, which can
effectively capture complex patterns based on both node features
and structure information, and then infer the accurate node labels.
It is also common that real-world graphs are heterophilous which
node is more likely to be connected with neighbors that have dis-
similar features or different labels. Many studies are proposed to
design GNNs for graphs with heterophily [1, 3, 16, 35].
The robustness of GNNs is well-studied, but most of them focus
on the perturbation of graph structure and node features [ 5,22,27,
38] while few works study the label noise. NRGNN [ 4] and LPM [ 29]
are the first two to deal with the label noise in GNNs explicitly. In
detail, NRGNN generates pseudo labels and assigns more edges
between unlabeled nodes and (pseudo) labeled nodes against label
noise. LPM utilizes label propagation to aggregate original labels
and pseudo labels to correct the noisy labels. However, they are only
suitable for homophilous graphs, and perform badly on graphs with
heterophily. Our proposed approach, 𝑅2LP relaxes the homophily
assumption and is more resilient to various types of noise.
6 EXPERIMENTS
6.1 Experimental Settings
[Label noise]. For each dataset, we randomly split nodes into 60%,
20%, and 20% for training, validation and testing, and measure the
performance of all models on the test set. We set 10% nodes with
clean labels, and corrupt the remaining training nodes with noise
in training set. Following [ 18], We consider two types of noise:
uniform noise means the true label 𝑐𝑖have a probability 𝑒to be
uniformly flipped to other classes, i.e. 𝑻𝑖𝑗=𝑒/(𝑐−1)for𝑖≠𝑗and
𝑻𝑖𝑖=1−𝑒;flip noise means the true label 𝐶𝑖have a probability 𝑒to
be flipped to only a similar class 𝐶𝑗, i.e.𝑻𝑖𝑗=𝑒and𝑻𝑖𝑖=1−𝑒. We
vary the value of 𝑒from 0% to 60%.
[Baselines]. We compare 𝑅2LP with 10 baselines, which can be
categorized into three types. The first type involves (1) GCN [12]
(2)GloGNN [16] and (3) H2GCN [35], three popular GNNs for
homophilous and heterophilous graphs. They are directly trained
on both clean and noisy training samples. The second type in-
cludes baselines that handle label noise: (4) Co-teaching+ [31] is a
multi-network training method to select clean samples. (5) Back-
ward [18] is to revise predictions and obtain unbiased loss on noisy
training samples. For fairness, we use GloGNN as a backbone GNNmodel for Co-teaching+ and Backward. The third type includes
five GNNs dealing with label noise: (6) NRGNN [4], (7) LPM [29],
(8)RTGNN [19], (9) ERASE [2], and (10) CGNN [32]. Since the
absence of publicly available code for CGNN, we validate 𝑅2LP
under the same settings in their paper and report the results of
CGNN directly from the paper. The results are presented in the
appendix C.1 due to the space limitation.
Due to the space limitation, we move details on baselines (Sec. A),
experimental setup (Sec. B), and other experimental results (Sec. C)
to Appendix.

Table 1 presents the performance results of all the methods on
10 benchmark datasets under different flip noise levels. We attach
Table 7 for various uniform noise levels in Appendix. Every method
was repeated 10 times for small-scale datasets and 5 times for large-
scale datasets over different random splits, and we report the mean
classification accuracy on the test set. From the tables, we make
the following observations: (1) 𝑅2LP consistently outperforms the
competitive methods across various noise settings in the majority
of cases. (2) The GNN models GCN, GloGNN and H 2GCN exhibit
good performance on homophilous graphs. However, their accuracy
drops dramatically as the noise ratio increases on heterophilous
graphs. (3) LPM, NRGNN, RTGNN and ERASE aim to address the
label noise in graphs, but their accuracy is limited on heterophilous
graphs because they rely on the assumption of graph homophily
and label smoothness. (4) Co-teaching+ and Backward are two
mainstream methods to address the label noise through sample
selection and loss correction. However, their accuracy significantly
declines when facing a high noise ratio.
Overall,𝑅2LP iteratively learns graph homophily to correct noise
labels, ensures high-quality labels for training the GNN model, and
achieves high and stable accuracy under different noises.
6.3 Ablation Study
The ablation study is done to understand the main components of
𝑅2LP. We first remove the whole label propagation step and call this
variant𝑅2LP-nlp (no label propagation step). Instead, we use self-
training [ 15] that just picks the most confident noisy labels in the

GNN and put them into the clean set to improve the performance.
Secondly, we replace the reconstructed graph with the similarity
matrix and call this variant 𝑅2LP-nz (no 𝒁(𝒍)∗). Further, we do
not propagate the noisy labels or the predicted labels in the label
propagation, respectively, and call these two variants 𝑅2LP-nnl (no
noisy labels) and𝑅2LP-npl (no predicted labels). We compare 𝑅2LP
with these four variants, and the results are presented in Figure 4.
Our findings show that 𝑅2LP outperforms all the variants on the
two datasets. Furthermore, the performance gap between 𝑅2LP and
𝑅2LP-nlp highlights the importance of label propagation for label
correction. The noise labels significantly enhance the performance
of label propagation, especially on heterophilous graphs.
6.4 Performance without Clean Set
For fairness, we remove the clean label set and further study the
model performance without clean set. The results on Cora and
Chameleon are given in Table 2. For each dataset, we compare
three noise rates from low to high under uniform/flip noise, which
leads to a total of 12 comparisons. From the table, we see that our
method𝑅2LP achieves the best or the runner-up results 11 times,
which shows that 𝑅2LP are still effective even without clean set.
For other competitors, although they perform well in some cases,
they cannot provide consistently superior results. For example,
under 40%uniform noise, Backward achieves the highest accuracy
of 65.46 on Chameleon, but its accuracy is only 80.18 on Cora (the
winner’s is 84.32). All these results demonstrate the robustness of
𝑅2LP against label noise.
6.5 The Homophily of Graphs with Iterations
We further study classification accuracy and the homophily of
the reconstructed graph with iterations. Specifically, we reported
the results at five-round intervals in Table 3 using the Chameleondataset. The initial homophily of Chameleon is 0.23. We observe
that: (1) Notably, 𝑅2𝐿𝑃significantly enhances the homophily of the
reconstructed graph with iterations under different situations. (2)
As the number of learning rounds increases, both the reconstructed
graph’s homophily and accuracy gradually improve and converge.

6.6 Runtime Comparison
We compare the running time using the Cora, Actor and arXiv-year
datasets in Table 4, where all processes are executed on a single
Tesla A100 GPU (80GB memory). From the table, we see that 𝑅2LP
is much faster than other baselines.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we address the problem of graph label noise under
graph heterophily. We begin by empirically exploring the relation-
ship between graph homophily and label noise, leading to two key
observations: (1) graph homophily can indeed mitigate the effect of
graph label noise on GNN performance, and (2) LP-based methods
achieve great performance as graph homophily increases. These
findings inspire us to combine LP with homophilous graph recon-
struction to propose a effective algorithm 𝑅2LP. It is a multi-round
process that performs graph reconstruction with homophily, label
propagation for noisy label refinement and high-confidence sample
selection iteratively. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments
and demonstrated the superior performance of 𝑅2LP compared to
other 10 state-of-the-art competitors on 10 benchmark datasets. In
the future, we plan to explore and improve 𝑅2LP in more challeng-
ing scenarios, where the clean label set is unavailable, or input data,
including node features and graph topology, also exhibits noise.

442Resurrecting Label Propagation for Graphs with Heterophily and Label Noise KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
A BASELINES
We compare 𝑅2LP with 10 baselines, which can be categorized into
three types. The first type involves (1) GCN [12] (2)GloGNN [16]
and (3) H2GCN [35], three popular GNNs for homophilous and
heterophilous graphs. They are directly trained on both clean and
noisy training samples. In the second type, we modify two typi-
cal loss correction and sample selection methods and make them
suitable for graph data. (4) Co-teaching+ [31] is a multi-network
training method to select clean samples. (4) Backward [18] is to
revise predictions and obtain unbiased loss on noisy training sam-
ples. For fairness, we use GloGNN as a backbone GNN model for
Co-teaching+ and Backward. In the third type, we compare with
five GNNs dealing with label noise, including (6) NRGNN [4], (7)
LPM [29], (8) RTGNN [19], (9) ERASE [2], (10) CGNN [32]. In
detail, NRGNN assigns more edges between unlabeled nodes and
(pseudo) labeled nodes against noise. LPM addresses the graph label
noise by label propagation and meta-learning. RTGNN introduce
self-reinforcement and consistency regularization as supplemental
supervision to explicitly govern label noise. ERASE introduce a
decoupled label propagation method to learn representations with
error tolerance by maximizing coding rate reduction. CGNN em-
ploy graph contrastive learning as a regularization term, which
promotes two views of augmented nodes to have consistent repre-
sentations which enhance the robustness of node representations to
label noise. Since the absence of publicly available code for CGNN,
we validated 𝑅2LP under the settings described in their paper and
compared them with it. The results are presented in the appen-
dix C.1.
B EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We implemented 𝑅2LP by PyTorch and conducted the experiments
on 10 datasets with one A100 GPU. The model is optimized by
Adam [ 11]. Considering that some methods are designed for sce-
narios without clean samples, we finetune these baselines on the
initial clean sets for fairness. To fine-tune hyperparameters, we
performed a grid search based on the result of the validation set.
Table 5 summarizes the search space of hyper-parameters in 𝑅2LP.

C.1 Performance Comparison with CGNN
We provide the mean accuracy of 5 runs for each baseline. In our
experiments, the training label rate is set to 0.01 and the percent ofnoisy labels is fixed at 20%. Table 6 presents the result on Coauthor
CS, Amazon Photo and Amazon Computers. From the tables, we
can see𝑅2LP consistently outperforms the competitive methods
across the uniform and flip noise settings in the majority of cases.

C.2 Hyper-parameter Sensitivity Analysis
Here we study the sensitivity of four hyper-parameters: the weight
𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3and the sample selection ratio 𝜀. The results are shown in
Figure 5. For all the hyper-parameters, 𝑅2LP consistently performs
well across a wide range of values, which demonstrates that these
hyper-parameters do not significantly impact the performance of
𝑅2LP.
C.3 Analysis of Selection Strategies
We compare the performance of 𝑅2LP by using different selection
functions: (1) Threshold [31] chooses the noisy labels whose con-
fidence is greater than a certain threshold; (2) Absolute number
selects an absolute number of noisy labels with high confidence
based on the current number of samples; (3) Statistical selection [17]
uses statistics to derive the threshold for sample selection; (4) 𝑅2LP
selects samples with high confidence based on a certain proportion
relative to the current noisy nodes. Figure 6 shows the results on
Cora and Chameleon datasets. From the figures, we observe that the
accuracy drops dramatically as the noise ratio increases when us-
ingThreshold andAbsolute number. The reason is that they choose
many noisy labels into the clean set. Statistical selection accurately
selects the node labels, but too stringent selection conditions limit
the number of selected labels. Compared with these functions, 𝑅2LP
selects the labels with respect to the suitable quantity and high
quality of remaining samples.
