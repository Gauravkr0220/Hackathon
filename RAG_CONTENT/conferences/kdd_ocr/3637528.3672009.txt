ABSTRACT
Prior research on neural architecture search (NAS) for adversarial
robustness has revealed that a lightweight and adversarially robust
sub-network could exist in a non-robust large teacher network.
Such a sub-network is generally discovered based on heuristic rules
to perform neural architecture search. However, heuristic rules
are inadequate to handle diverse adversarial attacks and differ-
ent “teacher” network capacity. To address this key challenge, we
propose Reinforced Compressive Neural Architecture Search (RC-
NAS), aiming to achieve Versatile Adversarial Robustness. Specifi-
cally, we define novel task settings that compose datasets, adver-
sarial attacks, and teacher network configuration. Given diverse
tasks, we develop an innovative dual-level training paradigm that
consists of a meta-training and a fine-tuning phase to effectively
expose the RL agent to diverse attack scenarios (in meta-training),
and make it adapt quickly to locate an optimal sub-network (in
fine-tuning) for previously unseen scenarios. Experiments show
that our framework could achieve adaptive compression towards
different initial teacher networks, datasets, and adversarial attacks,
resulting in more lightweight and adversarially robust architectures.
We also provide a theoretical analysis to explain why the reinforce-
ment learning (RL)-guided adversarial architectural search helps
adversarial robustness over standard adversarial training methods.

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have benefited many real-world
applications, such as image classification [ 16], object detection
[18], and natural language processing [ 24]. However, standard
DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising an effective
remedy to include deeper and/or wider blocks along with adver-
sarial training [ 20,23,32,34,37]. Since such strategies may in-
cur significant computational overhead, recent efforts have been
devoted to locating lightweight architectures that are robust to
different adversarial attacks through neural architecture search
(NAS) [6, 9, 12, 13, 25, 40].
One mainstream direction in NAS is to leverage a generative
process to seek the best-performed network architectures based on
a manually designed library of architectural ingredients. However,
given the complex nature of DNN architectures coupled with the
diverse types of adversarial attacks, such a process can become
too costly to cover various aspects, making it hard to guarantee
a good adversarially robust performance. Another line of work
suggests that there exists an optimal architectural configuration for
adversarial robustness in a large non-robust “teacher” architecture,
which enjoys a smaller parameter size and better robustness [ 12,25].
Consequently, network-to-network (N2N) compression could be
conducted to achieve adversarial robustness and has shown promis-
ing progress in recent works [ 12,13]. For example, Huang et al. [ 13]
investigated over 1,000 network architectures randomly sampled
from some large teacher networks and selected top-ranked robust
sub-networks. Empirically, they derived a set of useful rules that
can help to guide the design of robust ResNet ( RobustResNet ) archi-
tectures from different teacher networks and computation budgets,
varying from 5G to 40G. However, most of these rules are derived
in a heuristic way, offering no guarantee of achieving an optimal
trade-off between compression ratio and adversarial accuracy as
the learning environment changes, which thus may lead to subopti-
mal performance. As shown in Figure 1, RobustResNet [13] suffers
from a lower adversarial accuracy due to adopting the fixed config-
uration rules across different attacks and computation budgets.
To overcome the key limitations of existing solutions, we pro-
pose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, referred to as
Reinforced Compressive Neural Architecture Search ( RC-NAS ), that
leverages the flexibility of a specially designed RL agent supported

Figure 1: Architecture topology analysis of RobustResNet in different attack scenarios from the mildest (i.e., clean) to the
most severe (i.e., auto-attack) on Tiny-ImageNet. WRN-46-14 and WRN-70-16 are leveraged as teacher networks with 20 and
40 GFLOPs computation budgets, respectively. The corresponding student networks are referred to as RobustResNet-A3 and
RobustResNet-A4 . The entire teacher network architecture is partitioned into multiple (e.g., 3) stages as in [ 13] and we visualize
both depths and widths of the corresponding RobustResNet for each stage. In (a)-(d), the left three bar plots (in blue and orange)
show the depths and widths in the three stages of RobustResNet A3 and A4 that follow the same configuration rules; the right
three bar plots (in red and orange) show the adaptive configuration obtained by the proposed reinforced learning (RL) based
architecture search. In (e)-(h), the grey bars denote the capacity of the corresponding teacher networks and 𝐶denotes the
remaining percentage of each stage after compression.
by a powerful dual-level training paradigm to perform a systematic
search over a rich and complex space of architecture configurations.
The trained RL agent can quickly adapt to the highly diverse attack
scenarios and locate a compressed student sub-network with guar-
anteed adversarial robustness while meeting the computational
budget constraints. The ability to automatically adjust to distinct
attack scenarios and adaptively compress the teacher network in
different ways (instead of following fixed rules) is a critical step
towards realizing truly versatile adversarial robustness that signifi-
cantly advances the state of the art.
To achieve versatile adversarial robustness, it is essential to iden-
tify the key characteristics from different attack scenarios and train
the RL agent to recognize them and perform adaptive N2N compres-
sion given a specific attack setting. To this end, the proposed RL
framework collectively considers important features of the teacher
network, the nature of the dataset, the level of adversarial attack,
and the overall computational budget. Based on different attack
conditions as RL states, the compression ratio of each stage (RL
actions) should be adaptive to achieve the best compression and
robust accuracy trade-off. Specifically, given an RL state, the agent
performs an action to shrink the network by compressing the width
and depth at the stage level as well as determining specific config-
urations (e.g., convolution type, activation, and normalization) at
the block level. A specially designed award function that integrates
adversarial accuracy with computational budget constraint serves
as the feedback to encourage the RL to seek for architectures with
an optimal robust accuracy and compression trade-off.For the RL training, we introduce a novel dual-level training
paradigm that consists of a meta-training and a fine-tuning phases
to effectively expose the RL agent to diverse attack scenarios so
that it can quickly adapt to a sub-network customized towards the
unknown attacks during the test phase. In the meta-training phase,
a pool of diverse attack tasks with distinct characteristics is for-
mulated. The RL agent is iteratively trained by sampling different
tasks from the pool so that it can gain the capability to recognize
important patterns from different combinations of these key factors
and perform adaptive N2N compression. In the second phase, the
agent is given a more specific attack scenario and it performs fine-
tuning by leveraging the meta-trained model as the starting point
to achieve quick and effective adaptation. Figure 1 (a)-(d) shows that
the proposed RL framework can adapt to different attack scenarios
by finding highly customized robust sub-networks, instead of rely-
ing on a fixed set of configuration rules as in existing works. As a
result, it leads to much improved adversarial accuracy with a better
compression ratio. Furthermore, as shown in (e)-(h), highly distinct
compression ratios are applied to different stages of the teacher
network and an overall higher compression ratio is applied to a
larger teacher network. More interestingly, the compression ratios
also vary dramatically based on the level of attacks: for a more
severe attack (i.e., auto-attack), the first two stages are compressed
much less (to capture the subtle changes in the input) while the last
stage is compressed more significantly (to reduce the perturbation
caused by the attack). Our theoretical analysis provides further
insights on the compression behavior.
3002RC-NAS for Versatile Adversarial Robustness KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to provide a
principled RL framework for searching an adversarially robust archi-
tecture in a non-robust large teacher network (network-to-network
compression for adversarial robustness). Our main contributions
are summarized below:
•a novel Reinforced Compressive Neural Architecture Search
(RC-NAS ) framework that leverages the flexibility of reinforce-
ment learning to explore a rich and complex space of architec-
tures for lightweight and adversarially robust sub-networks,
•a simulated RL environment equipped with a specially designed
state encoder and an award function, allowing the RL agent to
encode key ingredients from the teacher architecture, the dataset,
level of adversarial attack, and the computational budget,
•dual-level RL training to enable quick adaption to specific attack
settings by exposing the RL agent to diverse attack scenarios,
•deeper theoretical analysis that reveals why the RL driven N2N
compression can lead to improved adversarial robustness.
We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed RC-NAS framework over different input conditions,
including different teacher network architecture with pairing com-
putation budgets (5G–40G), and visual learning tasks of varying
difficulty (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet). For the ad-
versarially trained RL compressed network, we compare it with the
latest N2N compression baselines for adversarial robustness and
show its superior performance across different teacher network
capacities, datasets, and adversarial attack test conditions. We also
emphasize that such good performance is attributed to the novel
RL framework and its unique dual-level training paradigm, which
is verified by multiple ablative studies and statistical analysis of RL
selected robust sub-network architectures.
2 RELATED WORK
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). There has been much work
on exploring the rich design space of neural network architectures
[6,14,40,41]. The principal aim of previous work in architecture
search has been to build models that maximize performance on
a specific dataset. There has been increasing interest in conduct
a N2N style architecture search to achieve adversarial robustness
[9,12,13]. For example, Wu et al. theoretically analyze why wider
networks tend to have worse perturbation stability on linearized
neural tangent kernels and develop a width adjusted regularization
(WAR) algorithm to address that [ 33]. Huang et al. emphasize that
a higher model capacity does not necessarily improve adversarial
robustness, especially in the last stage and there exists an optimal
architectural configuration for adversarial robustness under the
same parameter budget [ 12]. To this end, residual networks have
been intensively analyzed by considering architecture design at
both the block level and the network scaling level [ 13]. A robust
residual block and a compounding scaling rule have been derived to
properly distribute depth and width at the desired computation bud-
get. However, those proposed heuristic rules for N2N compression
are either too general or too specific for diverse adversarial learning
scenarios. A flexible way to achieve a robust architecture that can
adapt to the unique characteristics of each attack scenario is in
demand to achieve truly versatile adversarial robustness, which is
the focus of our work.Network pruning. Pruning-based methods preserve the weights
that matter most and remove the redundant weights [ 8,10,17].
While pruning-based approaches typically operate on the weights
of the model, our approach operates on a much larger search space
over both model weights and model architecture. Recently some
works have combined adversarial learning with network pruning
such as Hydra [ 25] and ADMM [ 36], but none of them have paid
attention to architecture search. Instead, our work focus on rein-
forced neural architecture search for adversarial robustness, thus
providing more flexible architectural design choices and enjoying
a compressed parameter space at the same time.
Reinforcement learning. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been
extensively applied in game agent training [ 21], natural language
contextual understanding [ 27], causal relationship inference [ 38],
image classification [ 11], object detection [ 3], time series analysis
[29] and information retrieval [ 30]. In the NAS domain, there are
some works [ 2,41] focusing on designing an RL agent to sample a
sub-network within a pre-defined architecture search space. For ex-
ample, Ashok et al. perform student-teacher knowledge distillation
for clean accuracy on small datasets [ 2]. However, none of existing
efforts pay attention to the relationship between the adversarial
robustness and the reinforced network-to-network compression,
which is main design focus of our RL framework.
3 METHODOLOGY
Overview. The overall goal of the proposed RC-NAS framework is to
train a RL agent so that it can perform adaptive N2N compression of
a large teacher network to achieve lightweight sub-networks robust
to specific adversarial attacks. Given a different attack scenario, the
RL agent needs to recognize its key characteristics and formulates a
customized policy to generated compression actions. To this end, we
propose a dual-level training paradigm and employ a meta-training
phase to expose the RL agent to diverse attack scenarios. For the
action design, we want our RL agent to control both macro stage-
level width/depth configuration and micro block-level details, such
as convolution types, activation and normalization. To support RL
training, we define a formal Markov Decision Process that provides
the key building blocks of the RL environment.
3.1 Markov Decision Process
The Markov Decision Process (MDP) for our proposed RC-NAS
defines its own state, action, reward and state transition function:
•State: State 𝑠𝑡is an embedding encoding the input teacher net-
work topology, adversarial attack level, dataset complexity, and
corresponding computation costs.
•Action: Action 𝑎𝑡is an embedding designating RL compressed
stage-level and block-level configurations given the input archi-
tecture for the current time step.
•Reward: Reward 𝑟𝑡is the trained RL-compressed sub-network’s
evaluation accuracy on a separate evaluation set of the same
difficulty as input training set, weighted by compression ratios
and normalized by the initial teacher network’s performance.
Also we consider the desired computation budget and set an
annealing penalty if it is not satisfied.
•State Transition Function: Transition function 𝑠𝑡+1∼T(·|𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡)
is achieved by multiple buffers, i.e. an architecture buffer which

Figure 2: Overview of the RC-NAS framework: In each time step, we sample the input teacher architecture, adversarial attack,
as well as a dataset and encode them into the next state 𝑠𝑡+1by leveraging the state encoder shown in Figure 2a. Then, the
multi-head policy network takes 𝑠𝑡+1to generate a compression action 𝑎𝑡+1that specifies the compression operations, such as
the remaining percentage of depth and width for each stage, as well as the application of robust block configurations. After
getting the newly sampled sub-network, it is included into the architecture buffer and the RL agent moves to the next step.
The reward is calculated based on the adversarial accuracy normalized by the robust accuracy from the teacher network, and
weighted by the compression ratio comparing to the teacher network. The whole RL framework illustrated in Figure 2b is
trained by vanilla policy gradient based on the above defined reward.
stores all the candidate teacher architectures to compress, a Data
buffer containing small/medium/large dataset choices, and an
Attack buffer consisting of different adversarial attack meth-
ods. For each time step, we randomly sample one architecture-
dataset-attack combination from these buffers as the new input
task setting for state encoding.
We introduce the detailed RL settings in the following section.
3.2 Reinforced Neural Architecture
Attack task formulation An attack task is formed by combining
an adversarial attack method P, a dataset𝐷, and an initial teacher
architecture 𝑓𝜓sampled their corresponding buffers. An evaluation
set𝐷𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 is further separated from the dataset for reward eval-
uation (we assign 256 data samples to the evaluation set in our
experiments). After the RL agent is fully trained, it will sample a
sub-network from the target task’s teacher network 𝑓𝜓, and then
the selected sub-network will be trained using a standard adversar-
ial training process on the clean training set 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and evaluated
onP-attacked test set 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡from the target task.
State encoder. As shown in Figure 2a, the state encoder takes the
initial teacher network topology as input, including each stage’s
width (scalar), depth (scalar), stride step of its first layer indicat-
ing whether to down-sample the input feature map into half from
the last stage output (binary), and the application of robust block
[13] inside each stage (binary). We split above information into
stage encodings which summarize each stage’s related informa-
tion. These stage encodings ST𝑖,∀𝑖∈[1,𝑁𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒]will go through a
bi-directional LSTM to output forward and backward encodings
𝐻𝐹
𝑖and𝐻𝐵
𝑖, respectively. The forward encoding summarizes all
previous stage information while the backward encoding considers
the afterward stage information beyond the current stage.To capture the level of adversarial attack, we propose to evaluate
the Lipschitz coefficient [ 28] of the attacked dataset with respect
to the teacher network. This can be achieved through three steps:
1) Train the teacher network using a standard adversarial training
process on the training set. 2) Perform adversarial attack on the
clean trained teacher network with evaluation set data applying
the adversarial attack method from the same input task setting. 3)
Calculate the Lipschitz coefficient of each adversarial attacked data
instance on the evaluation set by comparing to the network output
from the same clean instance,
LIPS=∥𝑓𝜓(P(𝑥𝑖;ˆ𝜖))−𝑓𝜓(𝑥𝑖)∥1
∥P(𝑥𝑖;ˆ𝜖)−𝑥𝑖∥∞,𝑥𝑖∈𝐷𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 (1)
where𝑓𝜓is the adversarially trained teacher network, Pis the
chosen adversarial attack, and 𝐷𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙is the evaluation set.
Finally, the capacity of the current input teacher network is rep-
resented by its inference speed cost on every data instance of the
evaluation set, which is measured by GFLOPs, resulting into another
embedding vector CT. By concatenating all four embedding vec-
tors, we generate the state embedding concat(LIPS,𝐻𝐹
𝑖,𝐻𝐵
𝑖,CT).

for constructing a two-dimensional
Gaussian distribution N(𝜇𝑖,Σ𝑖), to sample the remaining percent-
age of the width and depth after RL compression. We use a diagonal
co-variance matrix Σ𝑖by assuming that width and depth are in-

the probabilities 𝑝=(𝑝𝑖,1,𝑝𝑖,2)for sampling two binary signals
through a multi-Bernoulli distribution 𝐵𝑒𝑟to designate whether to
half down-sample the input feature map in the stage’s first layer
through the first binary signal and whether to apply the robust block
configuration in that stage through the other binary signal. For
those Gaussian and Bernoulli heads with parameters 𝜙Nand𝜙B,
we train them with vanilla policy gradient using the reparametriza-
tion trick [ 15], and the gradients from two heads will both trace
back to and update the shared feature extraction module parameters

where𝜎is the sigmoid activation function.
RL reward design. The evaluation reward is defined in Eq. (4). First,
the generated network compressed by the RL actions is trained on
the training set of the given task using standard adversarial train-
ing, and then evaluated on the adversarially attacked evaluation
set of the task to get the adversarial accuracy ˜𝐴𝑅𝐿. Then, the accu-
racy is normalized by the adversarially trained teacher network’s
evaluation accuracy ˜𝐴𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑟 and then weighted by a compression
ratio𝐶comparing to the teacher network, we use the quadratic
form𝐶(2−𝐶)to smoothly encourage a higher compression due to
the characteristics of the quadratic curve, where 𝐶=1reaches the
peak of curve 𝐶(2−𝐶). We also consider the desired computation
budget𝐶𝐵which is measured by GFLOPs. If the average inference
speed (GFLOPs) of the RL compressed sub-network on evaluation
set𝜁𝑅𝐿=𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡)surpasses this computation budget, the
reward will be penalized by an annealing factor 𝜖which starts 1 and
gradually reduce to 0 as training goes. Therefore in the beginning of
training, RL agent is encouraged to find the best adversarial robust
architectures suitable to the task setting while not paying too much
attention to the computation budget limit, and as it is trained to
grasp the necessary knowledge about architecture choices, it will
try to fulfill the computation budget requirements while following
its summarized rules for compressing the network.

Optimization. The state encoder is pre-trained separately as Fig-

weight will be frozen during RL framework training to guarantee
the training stability and success. For RL framework optimization,
only the actor will be updated by an RL training algorithm, namely
vanilla policy gradient (VPG), through multiplying the reward with
the probability of action leading to that reward. The training objec-
tive optimization of VPG is defined as Eq. (5), and the parameter 𝜙of the policy network 𝑓𝜙(·)will be updated.

3.3 Dual-level Training Paradigm
We develop a dual-level training paradigm for the RL framework.
The meta-training phase aims to expose the RL agent to diverse
adversarial attack scenarios so that it can it can gain a general
knowledge from learning a wide range of tasks of varying levels of
attack, dataset difficulty, input teacher architecture, and computa-
tional budget. In the second phase, the agent performs fine-tuning
on the target task by leveraging the meta-trained model as the start-
ing point to achieve quick and effective adaptation. For RL training,
we train the RL sampled sub-network on the training set with stan-
dard adversarial training and test its adversarial performance on
corresponding evaluation set of the same input task setting.
•Meta RL training: In each RL time step as shown in Figure 2b, first
we randomly sample a different task 𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘=(𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎,𝑎𝑑𝑣,𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑟)
from three initialized data, adversarial attack and architecture
buffers. Then, we calculate the Lipschitz coefficient and inference
cost encodings ( LIPS ,CT) and teacher network stage encoding
ST𝑖,𝑖∈[1,𝑁𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒]. We concatenate these embeddings and pass
to the state encoder and get the state 𝑠𝑡. Through the policy
network𝑓𝜙(·), we get the action 𝑎𝑡for different stages and then
conducting RL compression. For the newly RL compressed sub-
network, we evaluate its reward using Eq. (4)and train the RL
using Eq. (5)with VPG. Then, the sub-network will be added
into the architecture buffer and move to the next time step by
sampling next input task setting. When the maximum time step
𝑇is reached, we start a new RL iteration by re-initializing all
the buffers until maximum RL iteration 𝑀is reached.
•Downstream RL fine-tuning: After meta RL training, we let the
RL agent quickly adapt to the target domain by conducting a
few iterations of fine-tuning. We conduct similar operations as
in meta RL training and the only exception is that the target task
setting could be repeatedly provided as fine-tuning task input
instead of randomly sampling. We set 𝑇=1,𝑀=˜𝑀for an one
time-step, limited iteration RL fine-tuning.
The detailed training process is described in the Appendix C.
3.4 Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we theoretically demonstrate how the proposed
RL-guided compressed student sub-network trained on adversarial
samples results in a better adversarial accuracy compared to the
dense network trained using standard adversarial training. To prove
this, we leverage the idea of the dense mixture accumulation con-
cept and extend the recently developed theoretical framework that
justifies the effectiveness of the adversarial training to improve the
robustness performance [ 1]. For this, first, we define the problem
setup that involves the key concepts used in our theoretical analysis
along with some assumptions to make the proof easier. Next, we
present a lemma, demonstrating how the proposed RL-compressed
student sub-network leads to the tighter gradient update bound
compared to one without compression. Finally, based on the lemma,
3005KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Dingrong Wang, Hitesh Sapkota, Zhiqiang Tao, and Qi Yu
we present the main theorem that shows how the proposed RL-
compressed student sub-network achieves better robust accuracy
on adversarial training by ensuring the more reduction in the dense
mixture components compared to the the one without compres-
sion. For brevity, we denote RL-compressed student sub-network
trained using adversarial samples as 𝑆𝐴
𝑅𝐿−𝐶and the one without
compression as 𝑆𝐴
𝑈.
Problem setup. Let us assume x𝑖∈R𝐷indicates the 𝑖𝑡ℎdata
sample that is used to train the student sub-network obtained using
our proposed RC-NAS framework. Also, let us assume that the data
sample x𝑖∈R𝐷is generated from the sparse coding mechanism
with x=Mz+ˆ𝜖, where M∈R𝐷×𝐷is a sparse matrix whose basis
functions is learned by student sub-network. Further z∈R𝐷is the
sparse hidden vector with sparsity defined by parameter 𝑘.ˆ𝜖∈R𝐷
is the Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of
𝜎𝑥. Also, for the sake of simplicity let us assume that the final
student sub-network obtained using RC-NAS is a simple, two-layer
symmetric neural network with ReLU activation. Then with 𝚯𝑖,𝑡
being the hidden weight for the 𝑖𝑡ℎneuron at time 𝑡, the student
sub-network can be represented as:
𝑓𝑡(Θ;x,𝜌)
=𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1 ReLU[⟨Θ𝑖,𝑡,x⟩+𝜌𝑖−𝑏𝑡]−ReLU[−⟨Θ𝑖,𝑡,x⟩+𝜌𝑖−𝑏𝑡](6)
where𝑏𝑡is the bias at 𝑡𝑡ℎat training step 𝑡, and𝜌𝑖∼N( 0,𝜎2𝑝)is the
smoothing of the original ReLU. Then at any clean training 𝑡, the
weight learned by 𝑖𝑡ℎneuron can be decomposed as the following
Θ𝑖,𝑡≈𝑔𝑖,𝑡+𝑣𝑖,𝑡 (7)
where𝑔𝑖,𝑡=O(1)M𝑗indicates pure features’ contribution to pro-
duce the desired output and 𝑣𝑖,𝑡=Í

the dense mixture learned during the clean training in the direction

𝑗that are responsible to generate inaccurate response during
the adversarial attack. It should be noted that we have a big portion
of the robust (pure) features along with some small dense mixtures
during the training process in a given neuron. Also, 𝑗∈N𝑗where
N𝑗indicates the subset on which we have a highly correlated pure
features. Based on this problem setup we present the following
lemma for the gradient update.
Lemma 3.1. Let T be the total iterations for the clean training and 𝑇′
be the additional iterations for the adversarial training. Considering
𝛿be the l2-perturbation applied on input sample for the adversarial
training with a radius of the perturbation defined as ||𝛿||2≤𝜏. Then
gradient movement bound for 𝑆𝐴
𝑅𝐿−𝐶is lower than that of the 𝑆𝐴
𝑈.
Specifically let Δ𝐿𝑅𝐿−𝐶
𝑡be the gradient movement in 𝑆𝐴
𝑅𝐿−𝐶andΔ𝐿𝑈
𝑡
be the gradient movement in the 𝑆𝐴
𝑈, then the following inequality
holds at any iteration 𝑡
Δ𝐿𝑅𝐿−𝐶
𝑡≤Δ𝐿𝑈
𝑡 (8)
Remark. It should be noted that in the case of the 𝑆𝐴
𝑅𝐿−𝐶, we re-
duce the width as well as the depth of the given network. This is
the same as zeroing out unnecessary edges in our dictionary matrix
M. However, zeroing out the pure (robust) features in dictionary
Mwill lead to a smaller reward. Intuitively, we can infer that tomaximize the reward, the RL-agent is forced to compress less impor-
tant (mostly the dense mixture) components in the given network.
Based on this, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.2. Let𝑣𝑇+𝑇′
𝑖,𝑅𝐿−𝐶be the final dense mixture component for
the𝑖𝑡ℎneuron of𝑆𝐴
𝑅𝐿−𝐶and𝑣𝑇+𝑇′
𝑖,𝑈be the dense mixture for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ
neuron of𝑆𝐴
𝑈. Then, based on the gradient update Lemma 3.1 with
high probability we have the following:
max
𝑖∈𝑁||𝑣𝑇+𝑇′
𝑖,𝑅𝐿−𝐶||2≤max
𝑖∈𝑁||𝑣𝑇+𝑇′
𝑖,𝑈||2 (9)
Remark. This theorem indicates that our proposed RC-NAS based
sparsification mechanism on a teacher network has the potential
to further lower the dense mixture components compared to with-
out sparsification. This is because, through the sparsification, our
RL-agent strives to find the sparse student sub-network that can
potentially improve the adversarial accuracy by zeroing out the
many non-robust entries in the dictionary M. Please refer to [ 31]
for the detailed proof.
4 EXPERIMENTS
Datasets. We have three datasets as our test beds, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-
100 and Tiny-ImageNet. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are widely used
benchmark datasets in computer vision for image classification
tasks. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes,
with 6,000 images per class, while CIFAR-100 has the same number
of images but in 100 classes. In Tiny-ImageNet, there are 100,000
images divided up into 200 classes. Every image in the dataset is
downsized to a 64×64 colored image. For every class, there are 500
training images, 50 validating images, and 50 test images.
Adversarial attacks. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [ 20] is an
iterative FGSM method by iteratively conducting FGSM until the
image is misclassified or a certain number of iterations is reached.
In our setting, we try 𝑃𝐺𝐷20attack methods with an attack radius
ˆ𝜖=8/255and with a maximum number of iterations 20. Also, we
investigate a traditional Carlini & Wagner ( 𝐶𝑊40) attack [ 4], which
utilizes two separate losses: An adversarial loss to make the gen-
erated image actually adversarial, i.e., is capable of fooling image
classifiers, and an image distance loss to constrain the quality of
the adversarial examples so as not to make the perturbation too
obvious to the naked eye. Auto-attack [ 5] is a prevailing compre-
hensive attack method which is a parameter-free, computationally
affordable, and user-independent ensemble of existing attacks.
Experimental settings. Given four initial teacher networks (WRN-
28-10, WRN-34-12, WRN-46-14, WRN-70-16) corresponding to dif-
ferent computation budgets (5G,10G,20G,40G), we apply a range of
diverse adversarial attacks targeting on the trained teacher network
on the clean training set with the evaluation set and test set data. In
RL training and downstream RL finetuning, we leverage the train-
ing set and adversarially attacked evaluation set only. Once we get
the RL compressed sub-network architectures for the target task,
we train it with standard adversarial training on clean training set
and test its adversarial performance using classification accuracy on
the adversarially attacked test set generated above from the same
task setting. For fair comparison, all baselines (architectures found
by other research works given same computation budgets) will be

from the same task setting and evaluated their performance on the
same test split in the target task setting. The standard adversar-
ial training (AT) method is TRADES [ 37] with auto-attack as the
adversarial attack choice.
Baselines. We compare our proposed RC-NAS with other latest
neural architecture search works for adversarial robustness, such as
RobNet-large-v2 [ 9], AdvRush [ 22], RACL [ 7], WRN-34-R [ 12] and
RobustResNet A1-A4 [ 13] corresponding to computation budgets
5G, 10G, 20G, 40G, respectively. We also include the performance of
the teacher network in the beginning of each computation budget
category for reference. For fair comparison, we align the network
capacity of AdvRush and RACL to different computation budgets
by adjusting the number of repetitions of the normal cell N and the
input channels of the first normal cell C, denoted as (N@C). The
additional details of those baselines are described in Appendix D.
4.1 Results and Comparison
For target task settings, we use CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-
ImageNet as dataset choices, and train all baseline models under
four computation budgets using standard adversarial training on
the same clean training set and test their adversarial performance
on the clean test set or test set with three different adversarial attack
categories ( 𝑃𝐺𝐷20,𝐶𝑊40, AutoAttack). For the compressed sub-
networks selected by the RL agents which are fine-tuned given dif-
ferent target tasks, we train them with standard adversarial training
and report its their respective test performance on the correspond-
ing task setting, i.e.,CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 test set with no attack or
three different kinds of adversarial attacks, same as other baselines.
We summarize the comparison results of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100Table 2: Baseline Comparison on Tiny-ImageNet

in Table 1, and results of Tiny-ImageNet in Table 2. From Tables 1
and 2, our model consistently achieves better classification accuracy
under different computation budgets and adversarial attacks on
the test sets, either for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 or Tiny-ImageNet,
compared to all the other baselines of similar budgets. The RL de-
cided sub-network is not only superior in robust accuracy against
adversarial attacks, but also smaller regarding its parameter size
(See column #𝑃(𝑀)) and achieves faster inference speed, denoted
by GFLOPs in column #𝐹(𝐺).
Remark. We would like to clarify that we included PGD, which can
be regarded as an iterative FGSM. Since it is more severe than FGSM,
we did not report FGSM result separately. Instead, we provide a
more detailed analysis that varies the PGD attack upper boundary
rate from 4/255 to 16/255 and the results are summarized in Table 3.
As can be seen, RC-NAS maintains a clear advantage other strong
baselines such as RobustResNet-A1, A2 in 5G/10G computational
budgets under different perturbation rates.

4.2 SoTA Adversarial Attacks
As for black-box attacks, we already included auto-attack [ 5]. By
investigating latest adversarial attack methods, we conducted exper-
iments by adding advanced boundary attack [ 26], neuron-based at-
tack [ 39] and latest adaptive auto-attack methods ( 𝐴3) [35], (𝐴3) [19].
Specifically, we fine-tune our meta-trained RL agent under above
SoTA adversarial attacks on CIFAR-10 within WRN-28-10 (5G bud-
get). The comparison result with RobustResNet-A1 is shown in Ta-
ble 4. It can be seen that RC-NAS remains robust under these SoTA
attacks, and achieves clear advantage comparing to the strongest
baseline RobustResNet-A1, thanks to the achieved versatile adver-
sarial robustness.
4.3 RL Training and Fine-tuning Costs
Thanks to the unique dual-level training paradigm, the model can
learn the key characteristics from different attack scenarios through
meta-training, which takes around 45 hours. For other baselines,
to discover suitable sub-networks, they need to randomly sample
a large number of architectures and evaluate each one. For exam-
ple, RobustResNet samples 1,000 subnetworks, easily taking more
than 75 hours. More importantly, as shown in our paper, when
the learning environment changes, the heuristically derived rules
usually lead to suboptimal performance. This implies that a large
number of architectures need to be re-sampled and evaluated to
meet the new requirements, which is much more expensive than
RC-NAS’s adaptive training strategy. The fine-tuning time of our
models under different data sets, teacher networks with various
budgets are detailed in Table 5, which only takes 10 iterations and
3-9 hours to converge.
4.4 Ablation Study
4.4.1 Effectiveness of RL guided exploration. We investigate the ef-
fectiveness of the RL guided architectural exploration by replacing
it with other existing techniques, including advanced adversarial
training methods (TRADES, SAT, MART) and network pruning
methods (Hydra, HARP). In Table 6, we use Tiny-ImageNet as
our test bed and apply 20G, 40G as model’s computation budgets.
Then, we apply TRADES, SAT, MART to the teacher network using
adversarial training and conduct network pruning to the teacher
network with score masks (Hydra) or with a holistic aggressive
opinion (HARP) to construct baselines. Table 6 clearly shows that
the teacher network trained from all non-RL baselines cannot sur-
pass our RL decided sub-network. We further show similar results
on cifar datasets in Table 8 of Appendix D.2.
4.4.2 Effectiveness of dual-level training paradigm. Given the ef-
fectiveness of RL mechanism, we further investigate whether the
(a) RL downstream fine-tuned
 (b) RL downstream trained

training) selected sub-networks on target task setting: WRN-
46-14 (20G budget) on auto attacked Tiny-ImageNet.
novelly designed dual-level training paradigm helps improve the
test performance, which includes a meta RL training phase to opti-
mize under different adversarial tasks and a downstream RL fine-
tuning phase to let the meta-trained RL agent quickly adapt to the
target task setting. We name the RL agent trained directly on the
target task setting (without meta training phase) as R-NAS, and
the agent trained with the dual-level training paradigm as RC-NAS.
Table 6 shows that on a large dataset Tiny-ImageNet, under same
computation budgets, RC-NAS consistently improves over R-NAS,
as well as enjoys a lower variance because meta training gives RC-
NAS a good weight initialization that can be smoothly adapted into
any downstream tasks, without suffering the instability resulting
from potentially biased training under a repeated target setting.
Such phenomenon has also been verified by the detailed evaluation
curves along their respective downstream fine-tuning or training
process, where the RL downstream fine-tuned curve with RL meta
training will converge fast at earlier training iterations comparing
to the RL downstream trained curve w/o meta RL training, shown
as Figure 3.
4.4.3 Ablative Study on RL critical design components. We use RL
compressed teacher network WRN-46-14 (20G) on Tiny-ImageNet
as an example. Given the target task, we first train and downstream
fine-tune the RL agent using different design ablation component
settings and get the corresponding RL agent with its compressed
sub-network. Then, we test the sub-network’s classification ac-
curacy on the test set from the same target task, after standard
adversarial training. The result is shown in Table 7. We can clearly
see that model’s performance on all categories will largely drop
after the Lipschitz-guided data difficulty embedding 𝐿𝐼𝑃𝑆 being
removed in state formulation. Also, without 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 which reflects the
teacher network’s inference costs and capacity, the performance
will drop a little around 1%. Annealing represents the model is using
soft annealing penalty when constraints are not satisfied, otherwise

4.4.4 Statistical Analysis. Given different teacher networks (WRN-
28-10, WRN-34-12) with computation budgets (5G, 10G), we can
analyze the RL agent compress decisions on them for auto attacked
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. For WRN-28-10 as teacher net-
work input, it lacks enough generalization ability to auto attack for
either CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, resulting into a relatively higher

teacher model WRN-34-12, especially for CIFAR-100 which is more
complex to classify. For the total width to total depth ratio, 5G model
is much higher than 10G model on either CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100,
because the model needs to expand width more to effectively learn
the important features for classification given the relatively smaller
budget. For the 10G model, it possesses enough parameter learning
space and prefers adversarial robustness more than generalization
ability, thus tending to reducing the width for higher adversarial
robust accuracy. The statistical comparison is shown in Figure 4.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a RC-NAS framework trained by a novel
dual-level training paradigm to achieve reinforced compressive
neural architecture architecture search. Specifically, given an input
teacher network, a dataset and adversarial attack, our RL agent
is able to recognize its difficulty level based upon the capacity of
the given teacher network and perform the adaptive stage-level
and block-level compression to generate a robust sub-network ar-
chitecture. Experiments show that our proposed RL sub-network
achieves an improved test performance on a wide range of target
task’s test set across different datasets, adversarial attacks and ini-
tial teacher networks. We further investigate the topology of the
RL generated sub-network to illustrate its effectiveness in selecting
a unique and adversarial robust network architecture given the
target task requirements.

Appendix
A ORGANIZATION
We first describe the stage encoder pre-training process in Section B. We then describe the meta RL training and downstream fine-tuning
process in Section C. After that, we present details of the baselines along with some additional experimental results in Appendix D. Finally,
we discuss the broader impact of our work in Section E and provide the link to the source code in section F.
B STATE ENCODER PRE-TRAINING
Figure 5 shows the training process of the state encoder. Specifically, we pre-train it with randomly sampled diverse tasks, where the stage
encoding𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖, data difficulty embedding 𝐿𝐼𝑃𝑆 and inference cost embedding 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 are input into the state encoder to generate the state 𝑠𝑖
𝑡.
Then we decode 𝑠𝑖
𝑡into the same inputs again with an additional decoder using the supervision by the input concat(LIPS,ST𝑖,CT)itself.
The training target is formulated as Equation (10), where 𝐷𝐸𝜃𝑑(𝑠𝑖
𝑡)means the decoder network.

C META RL TRAINING AND DOWNSTREAM FINE-TUNING
The meta RL training process is shown in Algorithms 1. For meta-training, we set 100 iterations for the RL agent to learn the general
knowledge. Each iteration includes 5 time steps so 500 architectures will be trained. State and action generation are fast as they only perform
forward passes. Reward evaluates current selected sub-network. We train each such subnetwork in 5 epochs and evaluate their accuracy to
get the reward. For the downstream RL fine-tuning process, we provide the details in [31], which includes an algorithm formulation.
D ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT
D.1 Baseline Description
Guo et al. [ 9] take an architectural perspective and investigate the patterns of network architectures that are resilient to adversarial attacks.
Dong et al. [ 7] explore the relationship among adversarial robustness, Lipschitz constant, and architecture parameters and show that an
appropriate constraint on architecture parameters could reduce the Lipschitz constant to further improve the robustness, namely RACL.
Mok et al. [ 22] propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture search algorithm, based upon a finding that
independent of the training method, the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the smoothness of its input
loss landscape. Specifically, we align the network complexity of AdvRush and RACL models by adjusting the number of repetitions of the
normal cell N and the input channels of the first normal cell C, denoted as (N@C). Huang et al. [ 12] propose WRN-34-R based on three
key observations derived via a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on the robustness of adversarially
trained DNNs. Additionally, in the latest work [ 13], Huang et al. propose a portfolio of adversarially robust residual networks, dubbed
RobustResNets A1-A4, spanning a broad spectrum of model FLOP budgets (i.e., 5G - 40G FLOPs), based on a series of architecture search
rules found by a large-scale architecture investigation on CIFAR-10 dataset.
D.2 Additional Comparison Results
We further collect the adversarial training, network pruning and RL based methods test performance comparison results on a wide range of
target task settings in Table 8, including two cifar datasets, four clean/adversarial attack categories and two initial teacher network with 5G
and 10G computation budgets. All non-RL based methods follow the same training and test procedures in the same task setting as compared
RL method for fair comparison. We find that with RL dual-level training mechanism, the proposed RC-NAS is consistently better than other
non-RL based baselines or the baseline without meta RL training, which aligns with the conclusion in Table 6. Additional ablation study and
topology comparison results can be found in [31].

E BROADER IMPACT
The input data from many real-world settings is multimodal, diverse, and potentially noisy. Meanwhile, there has been an increasing trend
of running applications on edge devices which have limited storage and compute power. Therefore, shrinking the parameter size without
harming the generalization and adversarial robustness of a large network offers an effective vehicle to address the above challenges. Our
method provides an important step in realizing this objective by developing a generic RL based framework for compressive architecture
search while ensuring that the resulting compact network remains robust to a wide range of adversarial attacks.
