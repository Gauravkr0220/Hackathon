ABSTRACT
Learning path recommendation aims to provide learners with a rea-
sonable order of items to achieve their learning goals. Intuitively, the
learning process on the learning path can be metaphorically likened
to walking. Despite extensive efforts in this area, most previous
methods mainly focus on the relationship among items but overlook
the difficulty of items, which may raise two issues from a real walk-
ing perspective: (1) The path may be rough: When learners tread the
path without considering item difficulty, it’s akin to walking a dark,
uneven road, making learning harder and dampening interest. (2)
The path may be inefficient: Allowing learners only a few attempts
on very challenging items before switching, or persisting with a dif-
ficult item despite numerous attempts without mastery, can result

1 INTRODUCTION
Learning path recommendation (LPR) as an essential component of
adaptive learning has seen significant adoption in recent years [ 25,
38]. Unlike traditional education which employs a “one-size-fits-all”
strategy, learning path recommendation aims to generate personal
learning paths that consider individual differences [2, 21, 28].
In the literature, many works have been devoted to the LPR task.
Existing methods can be categorized into two approaches for path
generation: complete generation, where a fixed path is provided
to learners at once, and step-by-step generation, where a dynamic
path is generated based on real-time feedback from learners [ 2,29].
Among them, the complete generation approach is often considered
inflexible as it may disregard the evolving knowledge states (i.e.
mastery level) of learners [ 7,28]. In contrast, the step-by-step based
methods, which better account for the dynamic interaction between
learners and items (e.g. concepts, exercises, etc.), have increasingly
gained prominence and are the main focus of this paper. In this
branch, some works use traditional recommendation algorithms or
deep learning-based methods to recommend similar learning paths
to comparable users [ 9,27]. On the other hand, since learning path
recommendation can be regarded as a sequential decision making
problem, some works adopt advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods by formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) [21, 25, 33].
Despite the significant success achieved by these methods, there
are still some underlying issues that need to be addressed. Intu-
itively, the learning process on the learning path can be metaphor-
ically likened to walking. From a real walking perspective, most
existing methods tend to exhibit the following two issues: 1) The
path may be rough: In the learning path, the included items often
present a range of difficulty levels, with the difficulty levels fluctuat-
ing unpredictably. This dynamic nature of learning can be likened to
walking a dark road with uneven terrain. As illustrated in Figure 1,
when the difficulty of items sharply rises or falls, e.g., recommend
item𝑥3−𝑥2=4before item 2𝑥−5=3is correctly solved or
recommend items similar to 2+3after item 23+76has been solved
successfully, it can lead to a decrease in learners’ learning interest
and satisfaction. 2) The path may be inefficient: Treating differentdifficulty levels of items in the learning path with equal effort is
akin to taking the same number of steps regardless of the distance
of the journey. As depicted by the dashed backtracking path of
𝑐→𝑑→𝑒in the higher half of Figure 1, allowing learners only a
few practice attempts on very challenging items before switching
to others (e.g., only two attempts on concept 3, same as the easier
concept 2), or persisting with a difficult item despite numerous at-
tempts without mastery, can result in inefficiencies in the learning
journey. The root cause of these issues lies in the disregard for item
difficulty, which consequently hinders their ability to recommend
efficient and smooth learning paths that meet learners’ satisfaction.
In this paper, to conquer the above issues, we propose a novel
method named Difficulty-constrained Learning Path Recommen-
dation (DLPR) to achieve a more satisfactory learning path with
efficiency and smoothness by considering the difficulty of items.
Specifically, unlike most previous methods that primarily focused
on the granularity of single items (e.g. concepts), to adequately
capture the difficulty characteristics of different items and leverage
higher-order information, we first explicitly categorize items into
learning items (e.g. concepts or skills) and practice items (e.g. ex-
ercises or questions). Then construct a hierarchical graph where
each learning item is associated with one or more practice items.
Information from multiple levels of the hierarchy is aggregated
using Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) [ 33]. Next, we
develop the Difficulty-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learn-
ing (DHRL) framework, which consists of two agents with item
difficulty awareness. The high-level L-Agent operates at the learn-
ing item level, responsible for selecting subsequent learning items
for practice. The low-level P-Agent operates at the practice item
level, selecting practice items related to the learning item chosen by
the L-Agent. Additionally, a Knowledge State Estimation module
is introduced to generate agents’ states with difficulty awareness.
Further, we devise a Communication Mechanism between the two
agents to facilitate the generation of satisfactory paths in environ-
ments with fluctuating item difficulty. This mechanism allows for
the exchange of difficulty-aware information, enabling informed
decision-making and effective coordination between the agents. By
leveraging this communication mechanism, the agents can adapt
4168Item-Difficulty-Aware Learning Path Recommendation: From a Real Walking Perspective KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
their strategies and ensure the generation of optimal learning paths
that align with the appropriate item difficulty.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
•We explicitly consider item difficulty, analyzing and addressing
existing learning path issues from a real walking perspective.
This approach resolves the existing “rough” and “inefficient” as-
pects of learning paths, further enhancing both the efficiency
and smoothness of the learning journey.
•To fully leverage item difficulty information, we constructed
a hierarchical graph of learning and practice items. Further, a
Difficulty-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning frame-
work (DHRL) is devised. Synchronous consistency of path gener-
ation can be achieved through the division of labor and collabo-
ration between two agents with item difficulty awareness.
•We validate our model in three simulators based on two bench-
mark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
with efficiency.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Learning Path Recommendation
In online education, Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) stands
as a crucial undertaking, which refers to planning and designing a
structured learning path for learners, enabling them to systemati-
cally and orderly acquire knowledge and skills [21, 25].
Researchers have proposed various methods for the LPR task.
The existing LPR methods can be summarized into two categories
according to the approach of path generation [ 2,29]: (1) Complete
generation, a complete path of a specified length is generated and
provided to learners at once. (2) Step-by-step generation, a dynamic
path of a varying length is generated in real-time by considering
the feedback from learners’ interactions at each step with the next
item recommended [21, 25].
For branches of complete generation, many methods have been
proposed using different algorithms and techniques, such as de-
cision tree classifier [ 22], depth first traversal algorithm [ 49], re-
current neural network [ 48], etc. One of the most representative
works is proposed by Chen et al . [2], which formulated the rec-
ommendation task under a set-to-sequence paradigm and used an
encoding-decoding structure to achieve efficient Ranking-Based
Concept-Aware Learning Path Recommendation. Although com-
plete generation methods are widely used by researchers to generate
learning paths, they have several drawbacks. One of the main disad-
vantages is ignoring users’ performance and their cognitive changes
during the learning process, which may lead to users wasting time
on inappropriate or unmanageable paths [ 28]. Due to its ability to
better consider the dynamic interaction between learners and items,
the step-by-step based methods are rapidly gaining prominence.
In this branch, some works use traditional recommendation algo-
rithms or deep learning-based methods, e.g., using evolutionary
algorithms [ 12], matrix factorization [ 27], bayes theorem [ 41] etc.
On the other hand, since learning path recommendation can be
regarded as a sequential decision making problem, some works
adopt advanced reinforcement learning methods. For example, Liu
et al. [25] used the actor-critic framework with cognitive naviga-
tion as a recommender. Further, Li et al . [21] implemented efficient
goal planning and achieving through hierarchical reinforcement

learning. Despite their success, current methods often neglect item
difficulty, leading to unsatisfactory learning path recommendations.
2.2 Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in
Education
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a reinforcement
learning method designed to solve decision-making problems in
complex tasks [ 16,33]. In the educational data mining area, Zhou
et al. [ 46,47] exploited hierarchical reinforcement learning to make
decisions at different levels of granularity for effective pedagogical
policy induction. Lin et al . [23] and Zhang et al . [44] introduced
HRL to course recommendation for capturing learner’s different
preferences and interests. It is worth mentioning that, in the field
of learning path recommendation, GEHRL proposed by Li et al .
[21] implemented efficient goal planning and achieving through
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. Based on the demonstrated
effectiveness of HRL in the field of education and the hierarchical
graph constructed in this paper, we have chosen to employ HRL
for the task of learning path recommendation. Specifically, our
work differs from GEHRL in two significant aspects: 1) GEHRL
exclusively employs hierarchical reinforcement learning within
the same learning item graph, with both two agents sharing the
same action space. In contrast, our approach extends hierarchical
reinforcement learning to operate across two item graphs, resulting
in distinct action spaces for each of the two agents. 2) Furthermore,
our approach incorporates a mutual communication mechanism
between the two agents, in contrast to the one-way guidance from
the higher-level agent to the lower-level agent employed in GEHRL.
3 PROBLEM AND FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
In this section, we first formalize the learning path recommendation
problem and then introduce the overview of our framework.
3.1 Problem Statement
We focus on the issue of step-by-step recommendations for session-
based learning paths based on real-time interactions [ 21,25]. As
mentioned above, the learner’s learning process typically involves
two types of items: learning items (e.g. concepts or skills) and prac-
tice items (e.g. questions or exercises). Without loss of generality,
we denote the learning item set as LI={𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐 𝑀}and practice
item set asPI={𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒 𝑁}. The learner’s learning goals are
denoted asG={𝑔1,𝑔2,...}, where𝑔𝑖∈LI .
A typical session-based (e.g. chapters) learning path is developed
as shown in Figure 2. Before starting learning, a learner is tested
on his learning goals and gets an initial score 𝐸𝑠. Then the learning
can be cut into several stages. In each stage, the learner will study a
certain learning item 𝑐𝑖, and at each step of the stage, the learner is
presented with a practice item 𝑒𝑗
𝑖to comprehend 𝑐𝑖. Subsequently,
feedback𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑗
𝑖∈{0,1}is provided after practice, where 1 indicates

the learner has mastered the item 𝑒𝑗
𝑖and 0 for the opposite. All
item-score pairs constitute the historical learning record, denoted
asH=(𝑒,𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒). After time𝑡,(𝑒𝑡,𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑡)is added to the historical
record, i.e.,H𝑡=H𝑡−1∪(𝑒𝑡,𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑡). Finally, a learning path is
generated step-by-step as P=(𝜌1,𝜌2,𝜌3,...), where𝜌𝑖represents
a learning item or practice item. Here, we set 𝜌𝑖as a practice item
to align with previous works. After completing the entire learning
path, a final test is taken on the learning goals to obtain a final
score𝐸𝑒. Then we can calculate the learning effectiveness 𝐸𝑝[25]:
𝐸𝑝=𝐸𝑒−𝐸𝑠
𝐸𝑠𝑢𝑝−𝐸𝑠, (1)
where𝐸𝑠𝑢𝑝is the full score of the examination, which equals to
the number of learning goals. Our goal is to maximize the 𝐸𝑝by
providing an effective learning path.
3.2 Framework Overview
Figure 3 presents an overview of DLPR, which consists of two
primary modules. The left Hierarchical Graph module (Section 4)
establishes relationships between learning and practice items, using
a hierarchical graph neural network to extract enriched item rep-
resentations, emphasizing item difficulty. The right DHRL module
(Section 5), uses hierarchical reinforcement learning with a high-
level L-agent for learning items and a low-level P-agent for practice
items, collaboratively generating efficient and smooth learning
paths. The Hierarchical Graph provides the structural and repre-
sentational foundation for the DHRL module.
4 HIERARCHICAL GRAPH ENHANCED ITEM
REPRESENTATION
In this section, we present a concise overview of the construction
and representation of the Hierarchical Graph for items. This module
thoroughly captures the successive relationships among learning
items and their associations with practice items while considering
item difficulty, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent item
selection and recommendations.4.1 Graph Construction
To comprehensively model and consider the difficulty of different
items and their relationships, we categorize items into learning
and practice items and construct a hierarchical graph where one
learning item is associated with one or more practice items.
Specifically, the hierarchical graph of items is defined as 𝐻𝐺=
{𝑉,𝐸}, where𝑉is the set of items and 𝐸is the set of edges. As shown
in Figure 3, 𝑉consists of learning items and practice items and 𝐸
contains successive edges between learning items and evaluative
edges between learning items and practice items. To be specific,
a successive edge ( 𝑐𝑖,𝑐𝑗) represents that 𝑐𝑖(e.g. multiplication) is
logically the learning basis for 𝑐𝑗(e.g. algebraic equation), while
an evaluative edge ( 𝑒𝑚,𝑐𝑛) indicates that the practice item 𝑒𝑚(e.g.
4×9) assesses the learning item 𝑐𝑛(e.g. multiplication) [24, 39].
4.2 Graph Representation
For more comprehensive and effective modeling and utilization
of item difficulty, we first effectively represent item nodes by in-
tegrating difficulty information using MLP, and then aggregate
high-order and structural information through HGNN [42, 45].
Specifically, following some previous works [ 14,26,36,43], we
calculate the difficulty of the practice item 𝑒𝑗as follows:
𝐷𝑃𝑗=Í|𝑆𝑗|
𝑗=1𝑎𝑗==0
|𝑆𝑗|×𝜆𝑃, (2)
where𝑆𝑗is the number of learners who answer the practice items
𝑒𝑗.𝑎𝑗==0indicates learners that answered incorrectly and 𝜆𝑃
represents the predefined level of item difficulty. Similarly, learning
item difficulty 𝐷𝐿is calculated following a similar process.
Further, we represent all of the items and their difficulty with em-
beddings. Specifically, we use an embedding matrix E𝑝∈R|PI|× 𝑑𝑝
to represent all practice items, where 𝑑𝑝is the dimension. Besides,
we represent the difficulty embedding of practice items by an em-
bedding matrix E𝑑𝑝∈R𝜆𝑝×𝑑𝑑𝑝, where𝜆𝑝represents the predefined
level of item difficulty and 𝑑𝑑𝑝is the dimension. The E𝑙andE𝑑𝑙
of learning items are represented similarly. Then we can obtain

where W𝐿,W𝑃are the weight matrices, b𝐿,b𝑃are the bias terms

Finally, for each practice item 𝑒𝑗, it employs the simplified mean

bors and denoted as:

5 DIFFICULTY-DRIVEN HIERARCHICAL
REINFORCEMENT LEARNIN
To create an effective learning path, we use a Knowledge State
Estimation module to track learners’ evolving knowledge states.
This supports two hierarchical agents: a high-level L-Agent, which
recommends learning items considering prerequisite relationships,
and a low-level P-Agent, which suggests practice items related to
those chosen by the L-Agent and manages item difficulty fluctua-
tions for a smooth learning path. To ensure efficiency, the P-Agent
limits practice attempts based on difficulty-aware information from
the L-Agent. Together, the L-Agent and P-Agent collaborate to gen-
erate an efficient and smooth learning path. The pseudo-code of
the DHRL module can be found in Appendix A.
5.1 Knowledge State Estimation
Comprehending learners’ knowledge state is a prerequisite for
recommending suitable learning resources [ 21,25]. Knowledge
tracing algorithms have been extensively researched to track the
evolving knowledge states of learners based on their learning se-
quences [ 37]. Previous works on LPR utilized the Deep Knowledge
Tracing [ 34] for assessing learners’ knowledge states. However,
given our comprehensive utilization of item difficulty, we employ
DIfficulty Matching Knowledge Tracing (DIMKT) that considers the
item difficulty’s influence on the learner’s cognitive change [36].
Specifically, we retain the original DIMKT while solely replacing
the practice item embedding xjwith our aggregated embedding˜X𝑗
𝑃
through HGNN obtained from Section 4.2. This approach allows
us to derive the current learner’s knowledge state ℎ𝑡from their
historical learning records H𝑡−1while taking into full consideration
both the items’ difficulty and structural correlations. Following [ 21],
we utilize DIMKT’s prediction to estimate the ℎ𝑡rather than directly
utilize the hidden vector used in DIMKT.
5.2 L-Agent
As illustrated in Section 3.1, session-based learning paths involve
planning specific items for each stage. Therefore, we developed the
L-Agent to organize these learning items.5.2.1 State Encoder. The state of the L-Agent 𝑠𝑙
𝑖at learning stage
𝑖contains learning goals Gand the learner’s current knowledge
stateℎ𝑖−1at the end of stage i-1. Specifically, we use multi-hot
encoding to represent learning goals as G={0,1}𝑀, where the
learning goals’ indexes are set 1 and others 0 and 𝑀is the number
of learning items. The final state of the L-Agent is encoded as:
𝑠𝑙
𝑖=ℎ𝑖−1⊕G. (6)
5.2.2 Adaptive learning action space. The action of the L-Agent 𝑐𝑖
refers to recommending the learning item at learning stage 𝑖. If the
action space is the whole item set, the search space is very large and
inefficient. To constrain the action space, existing methods often em-
ploy neighbor sampling or embedding similarity sampling [ 21,25].
However, these methods are shortsighted, focusing only on items
near the current focal item. They work well when the focal item is
close to the target, but when they are far apart, shortsightedness
may cause navigation to deviate, reducing learning path efficiency.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a reference-path-assisted
adaptive method to help the agent determine the general search
direction and adaptively expand toward the goal item. Specifically,
we first use the A* algorithm [ 6] to generate the shortest path be-
tween the starting item and the goal item as a reference path. When
generating the learning path, we adjust it based on the learner’s
real-time learning progress. If the learning is smooth, we continue
forward along the reference path. Otherwise, we search with the
current item as the root node and then learn progressively from
nearby to distant items. Whether the learning is smooth is deter-
mined by assessing whether the learner has achieved the expected
mastery state after completing a certain amount of practice items.
Hence, we can dynamically ascertain the candidate action space
𝐷𝐿. The pseudo-code can be found in Appendix B.
5.2.3 Policy. After obtaining the learner’s knowledge state and the
action space, we still need to determine the optimal candidate learn-
ing item, which is most beneficial for achieving our learning goals.
We opt to employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [ 35] to
generate actions among 𝐷𝐿given by Section 5.2.2. Specifically, we
use a policy network as the actor to output an action probability
from distribution 𝜋𝐿(𝑐𝑖|𝑠𝑙
𝑖;𝜃𝐿)and a value network V𝐿(𝑠𝑙
𝑖;𝜙𝐿)as
the critic to estimate the expected return from each state. where
𝜃𝐿and𝜙𝐿are the corresponding network’s parameters. The proba-
bility distribution of learning items and expected return from each
state are calculated as follows:
𝑐𝑖=𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐹𝐶(𝑠𝑙
𝑖)), (7)
V𝐿(𝑠𝑙
𝑖;𝜙𝐿)=𝐹𝐶(𝑠𝑙
𝑖), (8)
where𝐹𝐶is the fully connected layer.
For the training, we use classical mean squared loss (MSE) to train
the critic and train the actor based on the PPO-clip loss function,
which is similar to GEHRL [21].
5.2.4 Reward. As mentioned in Section 3.1, our final goal is to
maximize the improvement of learners on the learning goals, and
we can’t avoid learning just because a certain learning item may be
difficult, which may lead to failure in achieving our learning goals.
Therefore, following previous works [ 21,25], the reward is set as
the learning effectiveness after the completion of the entire learning

path in Eq. (9), without considering item difficulty variation.
𝑟𝑙
𝑖=(
𝐸𝑝,if𝑖is the last learning stage
0,otherwise,(9)
where𝐸𝑝is obtained using Eq. (1).
5.3 P-Agent
Given that the L-Agent has selected the learning item for the stage,
we then build the P-Agent to recommend suitable practice items
while managing item difficulty to ensure a smooth learning path.
5.3.1 State encoder. The state of the P-Agent 𝑠𝑝
𝑡,𝑖contains learning
item𝑐𝑖in the current learning stage 𝑖and the learner’s knowledge
stateℎ𝑡at current learning step 𝑡. Specifically, we use one-hot
encoding to represent the learning item as 𝑐𝑖={0,1}𝑀, where the
learning item’s index is set 1 and others 0 and 𝑀is the number of
learning items. The final state of the P-Agent is encoded as:
𝑠𝑝
𝑡,𝑖=ℎ𝑡⊕𝑐𝑖. (10)
5.3.2 Relation-constrained practice action space. The action of the
P-Agent𝑒𝑡,𝑖is to choose the next practice item for a learner to
study learning item 𝑐𝑖. In contrast to L-Agent, P-Agent does not
require making action selections within an extensive item space.
Instead, it solely concentrates on the practice items associated with
the current learning item 𝑐𝑖at learning stage 𝑖. Specifically, the
candidate action space 𝐷𝑖
𝑃is got as follows:
𝐷𝑖
𝑃=Ψ(𝑐𝑖)∈PI, (11)
where Ψis a mapping function to obtain the set of practice items
associated with 𝑐𝑖from𝐻𝐺.
Taking item difficulty into account, the P-Agent starts by favor-
ing items near the initial difficulty 𝑑𝑖obtained using Eq. (15)and
later considers the entire 𝐷𝑖
𝑃as the stage progresses.
5.3.3 Policy. The policy of P-Agent is how to select the next prac-
tice item for a learner. Here we use an actor-critic framework [ 19]
similar to L-Agent in Section 5.2.3. The main difference between
actor-critic and PPO is in the actor’s training algorithm. The actor-
critic trains based on the simple policy gradient [21].
5.3.4 Reward. As discussed before, learners usually learn knowl-
edge gradually, and the dramatically varying difficulty levels of
recommended practice items may lead to a rough learning path
thus decreasing learners’ interest [ 15]. Therefore, we design a re-
ward𝑟𝑝1
𝑡applying a method proposed by Huang et al . [15] to control
the difficulty fluctuation as:
𝑟𝑝1
𝑡=L(𝐷𝑃𝑡,𝐷𝑃𝑡−1)=−(𝐷𝑃𝑡−𝐷𝑃𝑡−1)2, (12)
where𝐷𝑃𝑡obtained in Eq. 2 can be retrieved from the attribute of
the selected practice item 𝑒𝑡,𝑖.
In addition, to assess the effectiveness of the current practice
items, we design the reward 𝑟𝑝2
𝑡by examining the changes in learn-
ers’ knowledge states ℎ, which were obtained from DIMKT.
𝑟𝑝2
𝑡=(
ℎ𝑖−ℎ𝑖−1,ifℎ𝑖>𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒
0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒,(13)whereℎ𝑖andℎ𝑖−1denote the knowledge state at the end and begin-
ning of the current stage, respectively. 𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒 is the predetermined
threshold for the knowledge state.
Finally, the reward of P-Agent at each step is merged with 𝛼1,𝛼2
balance coefficients as:
𝑟𝑝
𝑡=𝛼1×𝑟𝑝1
𝑡+𝛼2×𝑟𝑝2
𝑡,𝛼1,𝛼2∈[0,1]. (14)
5.4 Communication Mechanism
To ensure effective coordination between the L-Agent and P-Agent
and achieve efficient learning path construction, we implement a
communication mechanism between the two agents. The P-Agent
organizes practice items’ initial difficulty and controls the learner’s
maximum practice attempts based on item-difficulty information
passed from the L-Agent.
5.4.1 Initial difficulty control. Initial difficulty control makes L-
Agent provide P-Agent with the initial difficulty information of
practice items as a reference based on the learning item chosen by
L-Agent in the current stage 𝑖and the learner’s current knowledge
stateℎ𝑖. This enables the P-Agent to have a good starting point for
recommending practice items that are suitable in difficulty for the
learner. Specifically, inspired by Rasch method [ 11], we calculate
the initial difficulty for the next learning item as:
𝑑𝑖=¤ℎ𝑖+𝑙𝑛(𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 𝑖
1−𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 𝑖), (15)
where𝑑𝑖represents the initial reference difficulty level of the prac-
tice items for learning item 𝑐𝑖.¤ℎ𝑖represents the learner’s mastery
level of𝑐𝑖, which is retrieved from ℎ𝑖using indexing, and 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 𝑖
represents the probability of a learner answering an item correctly,
which is flexible in practice.
5.4.2 Practice tolerance control. When learners learn learning items
through interactions with practice items, this process should be
finite. In other words, learners cannot practice the same item indef-
initely to master it, as it is inefficient and unreasonable. However,
since each learner has different learning levels and paces, the toler-
ance for the number of practice items should be individualized and
dynamically adjusted. Specifically, denote the tolerance at stage 𝑖
as𝜏𝑖, we get the tolerance as follows:
𝜏𝑖=𝑓(𝑝𝑖−1,ℎ𝑖−1,𝜏𝑖−1,𝐷𝐿𝑖), (16)
where𝑝𝑖−1andℎ𝑖−1represent the number of practice items at-
tempted for learning item 𝑐𝑖−1and the mastery level at the end of
the last learning stage 𝑖−1. As shown in Figure 3, this information
originates from the P-Agent, and there is mutual communication
between the two agents, which ensures smooth collaboration. 𝐷𝐿𝑖
is the difficulty level of 𝑐𝑖learning at this stage. 𝑓is an MLP that
will be trained. For training of 𝑓, we initially simulate 5000 student
learning paths in the simulation system without limiting tolerance.
This yields actual 𝑝𝑖,ℎ𝑖,𝐷𝐿𝑖for each learning stage 𝑖. To align
tolerance with actual practice frequency, we set 𝜏𝑖=𝑝𝑖, resulting
in training data 𝑝,ℎ,𝜏,𝐷𝐿 , which is iteratively trained.
6 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we first introduce the datasets and simulators. Then,
we demonstrate the superiority of our method through extensive
experimentation and evaluation.
4172Item-Difficulty-Aware Learning Path Recommendation: From a Real Walking Perspective KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
6.1 Datasets
Our experiments are performed on two real-world public datasets:
Junyi1and ASSIST092. Both datasets contain learners’ learning log
data. For the Junyi dataset, we use the “topics” field as learning
items, which are commonly used in education. Additionally, the
Junyi dataset provides a prerequisite graph of items, and we use it
to construct the 𝐻𝐺in Section 4. However, the ASSIST09 dataset
does not provide information about the knowledge structure, so we
construct a transition graph [ 30] as an estimation of the knowledge
structure [ 21]. The statistics of datasets can be found in Appendix C.
6.2 Simulators
For evaluation, a key issue is that existing realistic data only con-
tains static information. This data cannot directly analyze if practice
items not in a sequence can be answered correctly [ 15]. Hence, it’s
unsuitable for evaluating learning paths or training reinforcement
learning agents. Following previous works [ 2,21,25], to evaluate
different methods’ recommending effects, we use two kinds of sim-
ilar simulators built in [ 25]: Knowledge Structure based Simulator
(KSS) and Knowledge Evolution based Simulator (KES).
KSS is a rule-based system evaluating learner performance based
on Item Response Theory (IRT) [ 10]. KES is a data-based system
utilizing the DKT model [ 34] to simulate knowledge state changes
of learners. Considering the impact of item difficulty on learner
knowledge state [ 31,40], we develop DIMKT [ 36] to build two
different simulators KES-Junyi and KES-ASSIST based on datasets
Junyi and ASSIST09 respectively, and initial logs from a specific
dataset are used to simulate the learner’s initial state [21].
6.3 Experimental Setup
We implement our learning path recommendation framework us-
ing pytorch [ 32], gym [ 1], and the simulator code from previous
works [ 21,25]. In our experiments, we employed the same data
partitioning, data preprocessing, and simulator settings as in [ 25].
However, a significant change was made by replacing the origi-
nal DKT component with DIMKT, which has a 128-dimensional
embedding layer, 50 difficulty levels, and a learning rate of 0.002.
To align with DIMKT, we set 𝜆𝑃in Eq. (2)to be 50. Additionally,
we configured the parameters 𝛼1and𝛼2in Eq. (14)to be both 0.5.
Moreover, we set the mastery threshold as 0.6 in Eq. (13), which is a
common passing threshold in education. In Eq. (15), we set𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 𝑖as
0.5, indicating that the probability of a learner answering the item
correctly or incorrectly is equal. We use Adam [ 18] as our optimizer
and the learning rate is set to be 0.001. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sosweetzhang/DLPR.
6.4 Baseline Approaches
•KNN: KNN [ 4] find similar learners based on their learning paths.
The algorithm determines the next learning item for a new learner
based on the paths of the nearest identified learners.
•GRU4Rec: GRU4Rec [ 13] is a classic model taking the session
sequence as input and generating a probability distribution that
predicts the learning items likely to appear in the next step.

2https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/2009-2010-assistment-data•DQN: DQN [ 3] uses a neural network to assess action values and
recommends the action with the highest value.
•Actor-Critic: Use a GRU encoder and vanilla actor-critic frame-
work [19] as a recommender.
•CB: Contextual Bandits [ 17] is a learning path recommendation
method that treats the recommendation process as a contextual
bandit problem.
•RLTutor: RLTutor [ 20] is an adaptive tutoring system that com-
bines a model-based RL approach with DAS3H [ 8] for learning
item recommendation.
•CSEAL: CSEAL [ 25] is a method using an actor-critic framework
with cognitive navigation as a recommender.
•GEHRL: GEHRL [ 21] implements efficient goal planning and
achieving through Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. Specifi-
cally, GEHRL-EB is compared for its better performance.
Following previous works [ 2,21,25], we evaluate these methods
based on the promotion 𝐸𝑝(Eq. (1)) given by simulators.
6.5 Overall Performance Comparison
Table 1 presents the average 𝐸𝑃values of all models across the
three simulators, revealing several important insights. Firstly, our
proposed DLPR outperforms all baselines in all three simulators,
highlighting the necessity and value of considering item difficulty
in learning path recommendation. Secondly, Reinforcement Learn-
ing methods, such as CSEAL, GEHRL, and DLPR, exhibit superior
performance due to real-time interactive feedback, long-term cu-
mulative rewards, and consideration of cognitive structure and
action space constraints. Thirdly, a general decline in performance
is observed as the number of recommended steps decreases in the
simulated environment, underlining the need for improved recom-
mendation performance to enhance learning path efficiency. Finally,
as the number of items increases and the structure becomes more
complex, the diminishing returns of specific learning steps align
with intuition. This suggests that learning a larger domain of knowl-
edge requires more steps to reach distant learning goals, indicating
the need for additional time and effort to grasp new concepts and
skills as knowledge expands.
It should be clear that negative values in KES-Junyi and KES-
ASSIST09 are due to the presence of a large number of items in
these simulators, some of which never occurred in the training data.
This can lead to unstable predictions by the KT model, resulting in
negative rewards [21].
6.6 Learning Path Efficiency and Smoothness
To evaluate the effectiveness and smoothness of DLPR in the learn-
ing path recommendation task, we compared it with baselines using
three metrics while achieving learning goals. To be specific, we let
these methods recommend items for a learner to master three spe-
cific concepts random selected (i.e. 𝐸𝑒=𝐸𝑠𝑢𝑝in Eq. (1)which means
the learner should correctly answer all questions in the final test).
TheLearning-Steps metric captures the average number of steps
required to achieve learning goals, while the Cog-Gap (Cognitive
Gap) metric measures the mean difference between the normalized
difficulty levels of practice items and learners’ knowledge state
values calculated as Eq. (17). Considering that recommending dif-
ficult items to beginners or simple items to experts will increase

Steps, these two metrics are designed to reflect the efficiency of the
learning path. Additionally, the Diff-MAD (Difficulty Mean Abso-
lute Deviation) metric quantifies the average absolute difference in
difficulty levels of practice items throughout the learning process
calculated as Eq. (18). This metric measures the variation in item
difficulty, reflecting the smoothness of the learning path.

𝑛is the number of learning steps.
Table 2 presents the experimental results, indicating that DLPR
effectively recommends practice items that align with the learner’s
knowledge state while controlling difficulty variations. It signif-
icantly reduces the number of learning steps and improves the
efficiency and smoothness of the learning path. Please note that "-"
in the table indicates that the method cannot achieve significant
improvement and meet the learning goals, therefore making it im-
possible to calculate the metrics used to assess learning paths that
achieve the learning goal.
6.7 Ablation Study
In this section, we perform an ablation study on Junyi to analyze the
impact of some key elements in DLPR. We consider four variants ofTable 3: Results of ablation experiments.
Learning Steps Cog-Gap Diff-MAD
w/o ACS 154 0.1707 0.2099
w/o Init-diff 86 0.2133 0.1796
w/o Torlerance 94 0.2654 0.1832
w/o Diff-reward 61 0.3516 0.3235
DLPR 33 0.1313 0.1614
DLPR, where each variant removes one element from the original
DLPR. The details of these variants are as follows:
•DLPR w/o ACS, which refers to DLPR without adaptive learning
action space in section 5.2.2.
•DLPR w/o Init-diff, which eliminates the guidance of initial diffi-
culty control in section 5.4.1.
•DLPR w/o Torlerance, which excludes the practice tolerance
control in section 5.4.2.
•DLPR w/o Diff-reward, which removes the reward 𝑟𝑝1
𝑡that con-
trols difficulty variations in section 5.3.4.
From Table 3, several key findings can be drawn. Firstly, the com-
plete model achieved the best overall performance. Secondly, ACS
had the most significant impact on the number of learning steps, em-
phasizing the importance of correct choices and learning direction.
Selecting the right path is crucial for success. Diff-reward had the
greatest influence on cognitive differences and difficulty smooth-
ness, validating the effectiveness of our reward design in controlling
difficulty variations. Init-diff and Tolerance played varying roles
in all three factors. The collaborative synergy of the components
leads to optimal results, as the absence of any component results
in a decline in performance.

6.8 Impact of Difficulty Level Segmentation
As our main concern is the item difficulty, to investigate the impact
of item difficulty level on learning path efficiency and smoothness,
we conducted experiments using the ASSIST09 dataset, which of-
fers richer items. Similar to the common practice of categorizing
difficulty levels into three tiers: easy, medium, and hard [39], here
we aim for a more granular analysis of difficulty by classifying
it into 10, 30, 50, 100, and 500 levels ( 𝜆𝑃in Eq.(2)). These levels
represent different subdivisions of the same difficulty. Further, we
evaluated the performance of selected RLTutor, CSEAL, GEHRL,
and DLPR under different difficulty levels with a fixed number of
steps set at 20.
Figure 5 illustrates the results and highlights the importance of
properly defining difficulty level segmentation. When the segmen-
tation is too low, the distinguishability between items decreases,
leading to poorer performance in modeling learner interactions and
knowledge state changes. This also reduces the selectivity in recom-
mending suitable learning items, resulting in inferior outcomes. On
the other hand, excessive segmentation also deteriorates the perfor-
mance of the models. Additionally, with excessively fine-grained
segmentation, there may be a scarcity of appropriately difficult prac-
tice items for the same learning item. Interestingly, lower difficulty
segmentation may favor methods that do not consider difficulty
(e.g. CSEAL), as reduced granularity reduces difficulty fluctuations.
6.9 Case Study
Figure 4 shows the learning path recommendations of four models
in the KES-junyi simulator for a learner with specific goals. Theleft side of Figure 4 provides a partial knowledge structure diagram
of the KES-junyi environment for better understanding. On the
right side, four images depict the recommended paths by the se-
lected models, along with changes in practice item difficulty and the
learner’s knowledge states on the learning item. To be specific, the
horizontal axis represents the recommended items in the learning
path, where item ids may repeat due to multiple practices of the
same item. The vertical axis denotes the normalized knowledge
mastery and difficulty levels, ranging from 0 to 1. The figure re-
veals that: (1) The Actor-Critic method ignores knowledge structure
and item difficulty, resulting in disorganized recommendations and
failure to achieve goals. (2) CSEAL considers knowledge structure
but lacks planning between goals, resulting in poor learning out-
comes with only one item being accomplished. (3) GEHRL plans for
multiple goals but overlooks item difficulty, leading to detours and
incomplete goal achievement. (4) Our method, considering both
knowledge structure and item difficulty, efficiently recommends
paths with smoothness and achieves all goals.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we addressed two special issues “rough” and “in-
efficient” of learning paths from a real walking perspective and
proposed an effective and smooth learning path recommendation
method considering item difficulty. To be specific, we constructed a
hierarchical graph of learning and practice items to capture their dif-
ficulty and higher-order correlations. Then we designed a Difficulty-
driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework to generate
learning paths smoothly and efficiently through two agents’ col-
laboration. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority
of our framework in providing highly satisfactory learning path
recommendations by thoroughly considering item difficulty. Never-
theless, as we primarily conducted the experiments in the simulated
environments, further research will develop the system and test
the model in practical settings in the real-world environments to
investigate broader impacts.

A PSEUDO-CODE FOR DHRL
The pseudo-code of the DHRL module is presented in Algorithm 1.
The details are presented in Section 5. First, initialize the simulation
environment and set the learning path P=∅. During the learn-
ing process, the L-Agent recommends a learning item 𝑐𝑖. Then its
initial practice difficulty 𝑑𝑖and practice tolerance 𝜏𝑖are passed to
the P-Agent. The P-Agent then recommends practice items 𝑒𝑡,𝑖for
this learning item step by step and records the practice count 𝑝𝑖.
Feedback from each practice item is used to update the student’s
knowledge state. Once practice ends (upon reaching the mastery
threshold or practice tolerance), the practice count 𝑝𝑖and updated
knowledge state ℎ𝑖are sent back to the L-Agent for the next rec-
ommendation. This process is repeated until the learning goals are
achieved.

B PSEUDO-CODE FOR ADAPTIVE LEARNING
ACTION SPACE
The pseudo-code of the adaptive learning action space is presented
in Algorithm 2. In the algorithm input, 𝐺𝑙refers to the learning itemgraph, which is equivalent to the ‘learning item’ layer at the bottom
of the hierarchical graph (HG). Additionally, the shortest path is
obtained using the A* algorithm, a highly efficient and widely used
algorithm. Prerequisite(c) represents all the predecessor neighbor
nodes of𝑐in the graph 𝐺𝑙. If there are no predecessor nodes, it
returns empty. More details about Algorithm 2 can be found in
Section 5.2.2.
Algorithm 2 Adaptive Learning Action Space
Input:𝐶𝑠𝑡: start learning item; 𝐺𝑙: a learning item graph; T: learn-
ing target;𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 : level of proficiency target
Output:∀𝑑∈𝐷𝐿has a shortest path to Tin𝐺𝑙.
1:initial𝐷𝐿=∅and𝑄=∅;
2:obtain the shortest candidate path 𝑃={𝑐𝑠𝑡,...,𝑐 𝑖,...T};
3:add𝐶𝑠𝑡to𝐷𝐿;
4:𝑄=𝑃
5:while𝑄≠∅do
6: for𝑐in𝑄do
7: add𝑐to𝐷𝐿
8: Study𝑐and get the mastery level ℎ𝑐.
9: ifℎ𝑐>𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 then
10: 𝑐←𝑄.pop()
11: else
12: add𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒(𝑐)to top of𝑄
13: end if
14: end for
15:end while
16:return𝐷𝐿
C STATISTICS ON ITEM QUANTITY AND
DIFFICULTY
The statistics of datasets are provided in Table 4. Further, as shown
in Figure 6, we depict the relationship between the number of
learning items and practice items in the two datasets, along with
the variation in difficulty levels among different practice items. In
Figure 6(a) and 6(c), the blue boxplots illustrate the difficulty distri-
bution of all practice items associated with the learning item. The
red line represents the difficulty of the learning item. As mentioned
above, in real learning scenarios, a single learning item is typically
assessed by multiple practice items, each with potentially different
difficulty levels.
