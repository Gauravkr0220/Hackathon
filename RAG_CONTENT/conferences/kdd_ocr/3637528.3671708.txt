ABSTRACT
Smart homes, powered by the Internet of Things, offer great conve-
nience but also pose security concerns due to abnormal behaviors,
such as improper operations of users and potential attacks from
malicious attackers. Several behavior modeling methods have been
proposed to identify abnormal behaviors and mitigate potential
risks. However, their performance often falls short because they
do not effectively learn less frequent behaviors, consider temporal
context, or account for the impact of noise in human behaviors. In
this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an autoencoder-based unsuper-
vised user behavior anomaly detection framework. First, we design

1 INTRODUCTION
The rapid growth of IoT solutions has led to an unprecedented
increase in smart devices within homes, expected to reach approx-
imately 5 billion by 2025 [ 24]. However, the abnormal behaviors
pose substantial security risks within smart homes. These abnor-
mal behaviors usually originate from two primary sources. First,
improper operations by users can cause abnormal behaviors, such
as inadvertently activating the air conditioner’s cooling mode dur-
ing winter or forgetting to close a water valve. Second, malicious
attackers can exploit vulnerabilities within IoT devices and plat-
forms, taking unauthorized control of these devices. For example,
hackers can compromise IoT platforms, allowing them to disable
security cameras and manipulate home automation systems, creat-
ing opportunities for burglary. These security concerns emphasize
the urgency of robust behavioral modeling methods and enhanced
security measures to safeguard smart home environments.
Deep learning has been employed across various domains to
mine correlations between behaviors for modeling user behav-
ior sequences [ 22,31,32] and address security issues [ 2,13–15].
DeepMove[ 9] leverages RNNs to model both long and short-term
mobility patterns of users for human mobility prediction. To cap-
ture the dynamics of user’s behaviors, SASRec [ 20] proposes a
self-attention based model to achieve sequential recommendation.
More recent efforts[ 4,8,30] primarily focus on transformer-based
models for their superior ability to handle sequential behavior data.
However, we cannot borrow the above models to directly apply
them in our scenarios, because of the following three challenges of
user behavior modeling in smart homes.

Reconstruction Loss
Figure 1: Reconstruction losses for behaviors with different
occurrence frequencies.
First, the occurrence frequencies of different user behaviors may
be imbalanced, leading to challenges in learning the semantics of
these behaviors. This user behavior imbalance can be attributed
to individuals’ living habits. For example, cook-related behaviors(e.g., using microwave and oven) of office workers may be infre-
quent, because they dine at their workplace on weekdays and only
cook on weekends. On the other hand, some daily behaviors like
turning on lights and watching TV of the same users can be more
frequent. Behavior imbalance complicates the learning process for
models: some behaviors, which occur frequently in similar contexts,
can be easily inferred, while others that rarely appear or manifest
in diverse contexts can be more challenging to infer. We train an
autoencoder model on AN dataset (shown in Table 1), record the oc-
currences and reconstruction loss of different behaviors. As shown
in Figure 1, with the number of occurrences of behavior decreases,
the reconstruction loss tends to increase.
Second, temporal context, e.g., the timing and duration of user
behaviors, plays a significant role in abnormal behavior detection
but is overlooked by existing solutions. For example, turning on
the cooling mode of the air conditioner in winter is abnormal, but
is normal in summer. Showering for 30-40 minutes is normal, but
exceeding 2 hour suggests a user accident. Ignoring timing informa-
tion hinders the identification of abnormal behavior patterns. As
shown in Figure 2, sequence 1 represents a user’s normal laundry-
related behaviors. Sequences 2 and 3 follow the same order as
sequence 1. However, in sequence 2, the water valve were opens at
2 o’clock in the night. In sequence 3, the duration between opening
and closing the water valve is excessively long. Therefore these
two sequences should be identified as abnormal behaviors possibly
conducted by attackers intending to induce water leakage.

……
Figure 2: Example of three user behaviors with the same
behavior order. Sequence 2 and 3 are abnormal due to their
inappropriate timing and excessive duration.
Third, arbitrary intents and passive device actions can cause
noise behaviors in user behavior sequences, which interfere model’s
inference. Figure 3 shows noise behaviors in a behavior sequence
related to a user’s behaviors after getting up. The user do some
routine behaviors like “turn on the bed light”, “open the curtains”,
“switch off the air conditioner”, “open the refrigerator”, “close the
refrigerator” and “switch on the oven”. However, there are also
some sporadic actions which are not tightly related to the behavior
sequence, including 1) active behaviors, e.g., suddenly deciding to
“turn on the network audio” to listen to music; 2) passive behavior
from devices, e.g., the “self-refresh” of the air purifier. These noise
3552Make Your Home Safe: Time-aware Unsupervised User Behavior Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes via Loss-guided Mask KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
behaviors may also occur in other sequences with varying patterns.
These noise behaviors introduces uncertainty that can disrupt the
learning process and lead the model to misclassify sequences con-
taining noise behaviors as anomalies. Therefore, treating noise
behaviors on par with normal behaviors could potentially harm the
model’s performance, leading to increased losses.

Figure 3: An example of noise behaviors.
In this paper, we propose SmartGuard to solve above challenges.
SmartGuard is an autoencoder-based architecture, which learns to
reconstruct normal behavior sequences during training and identify
the behavior sequences with high reconstruction loss as anomaly.
Firstly, we devise a Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy (LDMS)
to promote the model’s learning of infrequent hard-to-learn behav-
iors. Secondly, we introduce a Three-level Time-aware Position
Embedding (TTPE) to integrate temporal information into posi-
tional embedding for detecting temporal context anomalies. Lastly,
we propose a Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss (NWRL)
to assign distinct weights to routine behaviors and noise behaviors,
thereby mitigating the impact of noise behaviors. Our codes are
released to the GitHub1. Our contributions can be summarized as
follows:
•We design LDMS to mask the behaviors with high recon-
struction loss, thus encouraging the model to learn these
hard-to-learn behaviors.
•We propose TTPE to consider the order-level, moment-level
and duration-level information of user behaviors meanwhile.
•We design NWRL to treat noisy behaviors and normal behav-
iors differently for learning robust behavior representations.

2.1 User Behavior Modeling in Smart Homes
Some works propose to model user behavior (i.e., user device in-
teraction) based on deep learning. [ 16] uses event transition graph
to model IoT context and detect anomalies. In [ 34], authors build
device interaction graph to learn the device state transition rela-
tionship caused by user actions. [ 12] detects anomalies through cor-
relational analysis of device actions and physical environment. [ 29]
infers user behavior through readings from various sensors installed
in the user’s home. IoTBeholder [ 38] utilizes attention-based LSTM
to predict the user behavior from history sequences. SmartSense
[18] leverages query-based transformer to model contextual infor-
mation of user behavior sequences. DeepUDI [ 35] and SmartUDI
[36] use relational gated graph neural networks, capsule neural
networks and contrastive learning to model users’ routines, intents

dicting next behavior of user accurately, they can not be applied
into abnormal behavior detection.
2.2 Attacks and Defenses in Smart Homes
An increasing number of attack vectors have been identified in
smart homes in recent years. In addition to cyber attacks, it is also a
concerning factor that IoT devices are often close association with
the user’s physical environment and they have the ability to alter
physical environment. In this context, the automation introduces
more serious security risks. Prior research has revealed that ad-
versaries can leak personal information, and gain physical access
to the home [ 3,19]. In [ 10], spoof attack is employed to exploit
automation rules and trigger unexpected device actions. [ 7,11]
apply delay-based attacks to disrupt cross-platform IoT informa-
tion exchanges, resulting in unexpected interactions, rendering IoT
devices and smart homes in an insecure state. This series of attacks
aim at causing smart home devices to exhibit expected actions,
thereby posing significant security threats. Therefore, designing an
effective mechanism to detect such attacks is necessary. 6thSense
[27] utilizes Naive Bayes to detect malicious behavior associated
with sensors in smart homes. Aegis [ 28] utilizes a Markov Chain to
detect malicious behaviors. ARGUS [ 26] designed an Autoencoder
based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to detect infiltration attacks.
However, these methods ignore the behavior imbalance, temporal
information and noise behaviors.

4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Solution Overview
To achieve accurate user behavior sequence anomaly detection in
smart homes, we propose SmartGuard, depicted in Figure 5. The
workflow of SmartGuard can be summarized as follows. During
training, the Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy (§4.2) is initially
employed to mask hard-to-learn behaviors based on the loss vec-
torLvecfrom the previous epoch. Subsequently, the Three-level
Time-aware Positional Encoder (§4.3.1) is applied to capture order-
level, moment-level, and duration-level temporal information of
the behaviors, producing the positional embedding 𝑃𝐸. This embed-
ding is then added to the device control embedding ℎ𝑐to form the
behavior embedding h. Finally, his fed into an 𝐿-layer attention-
based encoder and decoder to extract contextual information for
reconstructing the source sequence. During the inference phase, the
Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss Noise-aware Weighted
Reconstruction Loss (§4.4) is utilized to assign different weights to
various behaviors, determined by the loss vector from the training
dataset, resulting in the final reconstruction loss 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 . If the𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
surpasses the threshold 𝑡ℎ, SmartGuard triggers an alarm.
4.2 Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy
Autoencoders [ 37], which take complete data instances as input
and target to reconstruct the entire input data, are widely used in
anomaly detection. Different from traditional autoencoders, masked
autoencoders randomly mask a portion of input data, encoding the
partially-masked data and aiming to reconstruct the masked tokens.
By introducing a more meaningful self-supervised task, masked au-
toencoders have recently excelled in images [ 17] learning. However,
such reconstruction tasks without mask and with random mask are
sub-optimal in our scenarios because they do not emphasize the
learning of hard-to-learn behaviors that occur rarely.
We conduct experiments to verify the performance of autoen-
coders trained with three mask options: 1) w/o mask: no mask
strategy is used, the objective function is to reconstruct the input;2) random mask: masking behaviors at every epoch randomly to
reconstruct the masked behaviors; 3) top- 𝑘loss mask: masking
top𝑘behaviors with higher reconstruction loss to reconstruct the
masked behaviors. We set mask ratio as 20% for the latter two.
Figure 6 shows the changing trends of the reconstruction loss and
it’s variance of different behavior during training on SP dataset
(described in Table 1). First, as shown in Figure 6(a), the model
without mask shows the fastest convergence trend, whereas the
loss of the model with mask fluctuates. Model without mask can
simultaneously learn all behaviors, facilitating rapid convergence.
In contrast, the mask strategy only encourages the model to focus
on learning masked behaviors, which may hinder initial-stage con-
vergence. Second, the model with top- 𝑘loss mask strategy shows
lowest variance towards the end of training as shown in Figure 6(b),
because the top- 𝑘loss mask strategy effectively encourages the
model to learn hard-to-learn behaviors (i.e., the behaviors with high
reconstruction loss), thereby reducing the variance of behavior
reconstruction losses.
In this paper, we design a Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy.
Intuitively, at the beginning of training, we encourage the model
to learn the relatively easy task to accelerate convergence, i.e.,
behavior sequence reconstruction without mask. After training 𝑁
epochs without mask, we adopt the top- 𝑘loss mask strategy to
encourage the model to learn the masked behaviors with
high reconstruction loss. We continuously track the model’s
reconstruction loss of different behaviors by updating a loss vector
in each epoch to guide the mask strategy in the next epoch. In
epoch𝑒𝑝, the loss vectorL𝑒𝑝
vecis calculated as:

where𝑛𝑐is the number of times the device control 𝑐occurs in epoch
𝑒𝑝, andℓ𝑐is the average reconstruction loss of the device control
𝑐. In epoch𝑒𝑝+1, the mask vector for behavior sequence sample
𝑠=[𝑏1,𝑏2,···,𝑏𝑛]is obtained as:

where argsort gets the sorted index with descending order of the
elements in the vector, 𝑟∈[0,1]is the mask ratio, and 𝑛is the
length of behavior sequence 𝑠.
4.3 Autoencoder with Temporal Information
4.3.1 Three-level Time-aware Positional Encoder. The tem-
poral information in user behavior sequence data primarily resides
in the timing of control behaviors, which can be examined from
two perspectives: the absolute timing of each individual control
behavior, and the relative timing gap between control actions on
the same device. On the one hand, the relative timing gap between
control actions on the same device reflects the duration the device
is in some specific state and the operation frequency of the user.
On the one hand, user behaviors are usually time-regulated, and
the functionalities a device carried can determine the absolute tim-
ing users operate on it. For example, users usually operate lights

in the morning and evening, and operate the microwave and the
oven at meal time. Since certain operations frequently take place
nearly simultaneously, we will also consider the order of behaviors
to provide a more comprehensive characterization of behaviors
that occur successively. Therefore, we incorporate three types of
temporal information into our model. (1) Order-level temporal
information: we use integer 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟∈ [0,𝑛−1]to denotes the
order-level information of the behavior, 𝑛is the length of behaviors
sequence𝑠. (2)Moment-level temporal information: we repre-
sent the moment as hour of day ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟 and day of week 𝑑𝑎𝑦based on
behavior’s timestamp. (3) Duration-level temporal information:
the duration for behavior 𝑏is calculated as:
𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑏=𝑡(𝑏)−𝑡(𝑏𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡) (5)
where𝑏and𝑏𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 are the behaviors on the same device and 𝑏𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡
is the first behavior after 𝑏that operates on the device, and 𝑡(𝑏)
represents the occurrence time of behavior 𝑏.Then, the positional embedding is calculated as:
𝑃𝐸=𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟·𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠)+𝑤ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟·𝑃𝐸(ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟)+
𝑤𝑑𝑎𝑦·𝑃𝐸(𝑑𝑎𝑦)+𝑤𝑑𝑢𝑟·𝑃𝐸(𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛),(6)
where𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 ,𝑤ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟,𝑤𝑑𝑎𝑦and𝑤𝑑𝑢𝑟are learnable weights. 𝑃𝐸(·)
is a positional encoding function [33] defined as:
𝑃𝐸(·,2𝑖)=sin
·/100002𝑖/𝑑
,
𝑃𝐸(·,2𝑖+1)=cos
·/100002𝑖/𝑑
,(7)
where𝑖denotes the 𝑖-th dimension of the positional embedding, 𝑑
is the dimension of temporal embedding.
To learn the representation ℎ𝑐for device control 𝑐∈C, we first
encode device control 𝑐into a low-dimensional latent space through
device control encoder, i.e., an embedding layer. Finally, we add
positional embedding to the device control embedding as following
to get the behavior embedding:
h=𝑃𝐸+ℎ𝑐. (8)
4.3.2 Sequence Encoder. To learn the sequence embedding, we
employ transformer encoder [ 33] consisting of multi-head attention
layer, residual connections and position-wise feed-forward network
(FNN). Given an input behavior representation h, the self-attention
layer can effectively mine global semantic information of behavior
sequence context by learning query Q, key Kand value Vmatrices
of different variables, which are calculated as:
Q=hW𝑄,K=hW𝐾,V=hW𝑉, (9)
3555KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Jingyu Xiao et al.
where W𝑄,W𝐾,W𝑉are the transformation matrices. The attention
score Ais computed by:

where𝑑𝑘is the dimension of 𝐾. Multi-head attention is applied to
improve the stability of the learning process and achieve higher
performance. Then, the position-wise feed-forward network (FNN)
and residual connections are adopted:
h=Trans(h)=h+Ah+FNN(h+Ah), (11)
where Trans(·)is the transformer and FNN(·)is a 2-layered position-
wise feed-forward network [33].
4.3.3 Sequence Decoder. The decoder has the same architecture
as the encoder. We input hinto the decoder to reconstruct the entire
sequence, probabilities of target device controls are calculated as:
ehi=decoder

where ˆyiis the predicted probabilities of the 𝑖-th device control and
Wℎ∈R|C|×𝑙𝑒𝑛(ℎ)is the learnable transformation matrix, |C|is the
number of device controls, and 𝑙𝑒𝑛(ℎ)is the length of ℎ.
4.3.4 Objective Function. We optimize the model to minimize
the average reconstruction loss measured by cross-entropy loss:

whereSis the behavior sequences set, |𝑠|is the length of sequence
𝑠,y𝑖is the one-hot vector of the ground-truth label, 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑠is the
mask vector for sequence 𝑠, and𝑁is the training steps w/o mask.
4.4 Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss
Although LDMS encourages the model to focus on learning be-
haviors with high reconstruction losses, it remains challenging to
reconstruct noise behaviors due to their inherent uncertainty. The
significant reconstruction loss associated with noise behaviors can
overshadow other aspects during anomaly detection, potentially
leading to the misclassification of normal sequences containing
noise behaviors as anomalies.
To eliminate the interference of noise behaviors, we propose a
Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss as the anomaly score.
We can get the final loss vector after training:
Lvec=
ℓ1,ℓ2,...,ℓ𝑐,...,ℓ|C|	
,𝑐∈C, (15)
which is converted into the corresponding weight vector:
W𝑣𝑒𝑐=
𝑤1,𝑤2,...,𝑤𝑐,...,𝑤|𝐶|	
,𝑤𝑘∈(0,1), (16)
by the following equation:
W𝑣𝑒𝑐=sigmoid

Var(L𝑣𝑒𝑐)·𝜇!

where𝜇is a coefficient to adjust the input for sigmoid function,

tribution, respectively. Relu function ensures that behaviors withTable 1: Datasets Description.

The sigmoid function assigns small weights to behaviors with high

𝑝𝑖=W𝑣𝑒𝑐(𝑏𝑖)Í𝑛
𝑗=1W𝑣𝑒𝑐(𝑏𝑗). (18)
Then, we can get the anomaly score of 𝑠as the weighted sum of
the reconstruction losses of behaviors in 𝑠:
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑠)=−1
|𝑠||𝑠|∑︁
𝑖=1𝑝𝑖y𝑖logˆy𝑖. (19)
SmartGuard can inference whether a behavior sequence 𝑠𝑖is normal
or abnormal based on the anomaly score:
𝑠𝑖=nNormal, if𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑠𝑖)<𝑡ℎ
Abnormal,if𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑠𝑖)>𝑡ℎ, (20)
where𝑡ℎis the anomaly threshold. We take the 95% quantile of the
reconstruction loss distribution on the validation set as 𝑡ℎ.
5 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three
real-world datasets to answer the following key questions:
•RQ1. Performance. Compared with other methods, does
SmartGuard achieve better anomaly detection performance?
•RQ2. Ablation study. How will model performance change
if we remove key modules of SmartGuard?
•RQ3. Parameter study. How do key parameters affect the
performance of SmartGuard?
•RQ4. Interpretability study. Can SmartGuard give reason-
able explanations for the detection results?
•RQ5. Embedding space analysis. Does SmartGuard suc-
cessfully learn useful embeddings of behaviors and correct
correlations between device controls and time?
5.1 Experimental Setup
5.1.1 Datasets. We train SmartGuard on three real-world datasets
consisting of only normal samples, two (FR/SP) from public datasets2
and one anonymous dataset (AN) collected by ourselves. The datasets
description is shown in Table 1. All datasets are split into training,
validation and testing sets with a ratio of 7:1:2. To evaluate the
performance of SmartGuard, we construct ten categories of abnor-
mal behaviors as shown in Table 2 and insert them among normal
behaviors for simulating real anomaly scenarios.

5.1.2 Baselines. We compare SmartGuard with existing general
unsupervised anomaly detection methods and unsupervised anom-
aly behaviors detection methods in smart homes:
•Local Outiler Factor (LOF) [6] calculates the density ratio
between each sample and its neighbors to detect anomaly.
•Isolation Forest (IF) [23] builds binary trees, and instances
with short average path lengths are detected as anomaly.
•6thSense [27] utilizes Naive Bayes to detect malicious be-
havior associated with sensors in smart homes.
•Aegis[ 28] utilizes a Markov Chain-based machine learning
technique to detect malicious behavior in smart homes.
•OCSVM [1] build a One-Class Support Vector Machine
model to prevent malicious control of smart home systems.
•Autoencoder [5] learns to reconstruct normal data and then
uses the reconstruction error to determine whether the input
data is abnormal.
•ARGUS[ 26] designed an Autoencoder based on Gated Re-
current Units (GRU) to detect IoT infiltration attacks.
•TransformerAutoencoder (TransAE) [33] uses self-attention
mechanism in the encoder and decoder to achieve context-
aware anomaly detection.
5.1.3 Evaluation metrics. We use common metrics such as False
Positive rate, False Negative Rate, Recall, and F1-Score to evaluate
the performance of SmartGuard.
5.1.4 Complexity analysis. Suppose the embedding size is 𝑒𝑚,
and the behavior sequence length is 𝑛. The computational complex-
ity of SmartGuard is mainly due to the self-attention layer and the
feed-forward network, which is 𝑂(𝑛2𝑑+𝑛𝑑2). The dominant term
is typically𝑂(𝑛2𝑑)from the self-attention layer. SmartGuard only
takes 0.0145s, which shows that it can detect abnormal behaviors
in real time.
5.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)
We use grid search to adjust the parameters of SmartGuard and
report the overall performance of SmartGuard and all baselines
in Table 3. Bold values indicate the optimal performance among
all schemes, and underlined values indicate the second best per-
formance. First, SmartGuard outperforms all competitors in most
cases. This is because SmartGuardsimultaneously considers the
temporal information, behavior imbalance and noise behaviors.Second, SmartGuard significantly improves the performance on
DM and DD type anomalies detection. We ascribe this superiority to
our TTPE’s effective mining of temporal information of behaviors.
Third, the LOF, IF and 6thSense show the worst performance. Aegis
and OCSVM outperforms LOF, IF and 6thSense, which benifits
from the Markov Chain’s modeling of behavior transitions and
SVM’s powerful kernel function. The Autoencoder outperform the
traditional models because of stronger sequence modeling capabil-
ity. ARGUS outperforms Aueocoder because of stronger sequence
modeling capability of GRU. By exploiting transformer to mine
contextual information, TransAE achieves better performance than
all other baselines, but is still inferior to our proposed scheme.
5.3 Ablation Study (RQ2)
SmartGuard mainly consists of three main components: Loss-guided
Dynamic Mask Strategy (LDMS), Three-level Time-aware Position
Embedding (TTPE) and Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction
Loss (NWRL). To investigate different components’ effectiveness
in SmartGuard, we implement 5 variants of SmartGuard for abla-
tion study (𝐶0-𝐶4). Y represents adding the corresponding compo-
nents, Xrepresents removing the corresponding components. 𝐶4is
SmartGuard with all three components. As shown in Table 4, each
component of SmartGuard has a positive impact on results. The
combination of all components brings the best results, which is
much better than using any subset of the three components.
5.4 Parameter Study (RQ3)
5.4.1 The mask ratio 𝑟and the training step 𝑁without mask.
Figure 7 illustrates that SmartGuard achieves the optimal perfor-
mance when 𝑟=0.4and𝑁=5. The parameter 𝑟(Equation 3)
determines the difficulty of the model learning task. A smaller
𝑟fails to effectively encourage the model to learn hard-to-learn
behaviors, while a larger 𝑟increases the learning burden on the
model, consequently diminishing performance. As for training steps
without a mask, a smaller 𝑁hinders the model from converging
effectively at the beginning stage, whereas a larger 𝑁impedes the
model’s ability to learn hard-to-learn behaviors towards the end,
resulting in degraded performance.
5.4.2𝜇of Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss. The
parameter𝜇(Equation 17) controls the weights assigned to poten-
tial noise behaviors. A smaller 𝜇results in a smaller weight for noise
behaviors, while a larger 𝜇leads to a greater weight for noise behav-
iors. As illustrated in Figure 8(a), the False Positive Rate gradually
decreases as 𝜇decreases, benefiting from the reduced loss weight
assigned to noise behaviors. However, as depicted in Figure 8(b),
the False Negative Rate slightly increases as 𝜇decreases. When
𝜇=0.1, SmartGuard achieves a balance, minimizing both the False
Positive Rate and the False Negative Rate.
5.4.3 The embedding size 𝑒𝑚.We fine-tune the embedding size
for time and device control, ranging from 8 to 512. As depicted
in Figure 9(a), an initial increase in the embedding dimension re-
sults in a notable performance improvement, which is attributed
to the larger dimensionality enabling behavior embedding to cap-
ture more comprehensive information about the context, thereby

furnishing valuable representations for other modules in Smart-

performance degradation due to over-fitting.

leads to under-fitting, and too many layers leads to over-fitting.
5.5 Case Study (RQ4)
To assess the interpretability of SmartGuard, we select a behavior
sequence from the test set of the AN dataset and visualize its atten-
tion weights and reconstruction loss. Illustrated in Figure 10, the
user initiated a sequence of actions: turning off the TV, stopping the
sweeper, closing the curtains, switching off the bedlight, and lock-
ing the smart lock before going to sleep. Subsequently, an attacker
took control of IoT devices, turning off the camera, and opening
the window for potential theft. Examining Figure 10(a), we observe

5.6 Embedding Space Analysis (RQ5)
We visualize the similarity between device embeddings and time
embeddings (i.e., hour embedding, day embedding and duration
embeddings) to analyze whether the model effectively learns the
relationship between behaviors. As shown in Figure 11(a), opening
the curtains usually occurs between 6-9 and 9-12 o’clock because
users usually get up during this period, while closing the curtains
generally occurs between 21-24 o’clock because the user usuallygo to bed during this period. The dishwasher usually runs between
12-15 and 18-21 o’clock, which means that the user has lunch and
dinner during this period, and then washes the dishes. As shown
in Figure 11(b), users generally watch TV and do laundry on Satur-
days and Sundays. As shown in Figure 11(c), users usually take a
bath for about 1-2 hours, bath time longer than this may indicate
abnormality occurs.

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce SmartGuard for unsupervised user be-
havior anomaly detection. We first devise a Loss-guided Dynamic
Mask Strategy (LDMS) to encourage the model to learn less frequent
behaviors that are often overlooked during the learning process.
Additionally, we introduce Three-level Time-aware Position Embed-
ding (TTPE) to integrate temporal information into positional em-
bedding, allowing for the detection of temporal context anomalies.
Furthermore, we propose a Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction
Loss (NWRL) to assign distinct weights for routine behaviors and
noise behaviors, thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Compre-
hensive experiments conducted on three datasets encompassing
ten types of anomaly behaviors demonstrate that SmartGuard con-
sistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while delivering
highly interpretable results.

A.3 Data collection
Testbed and Participants. To create a practical and viable smart
home model, we implemented our experimental platform within
an apartment setting to gather user usage data of various devices,
forming our smart home user behavior dataset (AN). Three vol-
unteers were recruited to simulate the typical daily activities of
a standard family, assuming the roles of an adult male, an adult
female, and a child. The experimental platform comprises a compre-
hensive selection of 36 popular market-available devices, detailed
in Table 6, with their deployment illustrated in Figure 12.

Normal Behavior Collection. We enlisted volunteers to re-
side in apartments and encouraged them to utilize equipment in
accordance with their individual habits. Throughout the designated
period of occupancy, we refrained from actively or directly inter-
vening in the users’ behavior. However, we implemented a system
where users consistently logged their activities. Following the con-
clusion of the data collection phase, we reviewed the device usage
logs via the smart home app, amalgamating these logs with the
users’ behavior records to compile a comprehensive user behavior
dataset. To mitigate potential biases arising from acclimating to

a new living environment, participants were required to inhabit
the experimental setting for a minimum of two weeks before the
formal commencement of data collection. All users possessed com-
prehensive knowledge of the IoT devices and applications in use.
Subsequent to check-in, control of all devices was relinquished to
the users, who were duly informed in advance that their device
usage would be subsequently reviewed and analyzed by our team
Anomaly Behavior Injection. We insert abnormal behaviors
in Table 2 into normal behavior sequences to construct abnormal
behavior sequences. Then the abnormal behavior sequences. Then
the abnormal behavior sequence and the normal behavior sequence
together form the test dataset. The anomaly behavior sequences
examples are shown in Figure 13.

A.4 Detailed experimental settings
All models (including baselines and SmartGuard) are implemented
by PyTorch [ 25] and run on a graphic card of GeForce RTX 3090
Ti. All models are trained with Adam optimizer [ 21] with learning
rate 0.001. We train SmartGuard to minimize L𝑟𝑒𝑐in Equation (14).
During training, we monitor reconstruction loss and stop training
if there is no performance improvement on the validation set in10 steps. For model hyperparameters of SmartGuard, we set the
batch size to 512 and the initial weights of TTPE are 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 =
0.1,𝑤ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟=0.4,𝑤𝑑𝑎𝑦=0.4, and𝑤𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =0.7. For mask ratio
and step without step, we search in {0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8}and{3,4,5,6},
respectively. We chose the number of encoder and decoder layers
in{1,2,3,4}, and the embedding size in {8,16,32,64,128,256,512}.
A.5 Mask strategy deep dive
To verify the effectiveness of LDMS, we compared it with the three
baselines (w/o mask, random mask and top- 𝑘loss mask) mentioned
in the section 4.2. As illustrated in Figure 14(a), LDMS consistently
outperforms all other mask strategies across four types of anom-
alies. The results presented in Figure 14(b) further demonstrate that
LDMS exhibits the smallest variance in reconstruction loss through-
out the training process, which demonstrates that SmartGuard
learns both easy-to-learn behaviors and hard-to-learn behaviors
very well. We also plotted the loss distribution diagram under dif-
ferent mask strategies. As shown in Figure 15, LDMS shows the
smallest reconstruction loss and variance, which demonstrates that
our mask strategy can better learn hard-to-learn behaviors. We can
still observe behaviors with high reconstruction loss as pointed by
the red dashed arrow after applying LDMS, which is likely to be
noise behaviors, thus it’s necessary to assign small weights for these
noise behaviors during anomaly detection for avoiding identifying
normal sequences containing noise behaviors as abnormal.
