ABSTRACT
The unsecured personal loan (UPL) market is a multi-billion dollar
market where numerous financial institutions compete. Due to the
development of online banking, loan applicants start to compare
numerous loan products. They aim for high loan limits and low
interest rates. Since loan applicants have a desired loan amount,
institutions instead focus on adjusting interest rates. Despite the
importance of determining optimal interest strategies, institutions
have traditionally relied on heuristic methods by human experts to
set interest rates. This is done by adding a target return on assets
(ROA) to the applicant’s expected default probability predicted by
a credit scoring system (CSS) such as the FICO score.
We conceptualize the UPL market dynamics as a repeated auc-
tion scenario, where loan applicants (akin to sellers) seek the lowest
interest rates, while financial institutions (akin to bidders) aim to
maximize profits through higher interest rates. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time anyone has approached the UPL
market through the viewpoint of a repeated auction. While there
are several research done in learning to bid in repeated auctions,
those works cannot be directly applied to the UPL market due to the
lack of any feedback about other bidders’ strategies and the need
to satisfy the bidder’s target loan volume and profit variance. We
present an algorithm named AutoInterest, which is a modification
of the dual gradient descent algorithm. In addition, we provide a
framework to evaluate interest rate bidding strategies on a bench-
mark dataset and the credit bureau dataset of actual loan applicants
in South Korea. We evaluate AutoInterest on this framework and
show higher cumulative profit compared to other common online
algorithms and the current fixed strategy used by real institutions.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the growth of online banking has made unsecured
personal loans (UPL) much more accessible, leading to a significant
expansion of the market. Various financial institutions, including
banks, credit unions, and savings banks, actively engage as lenders
within the UPL market. According to the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, the UPL market grew from $104 billion in 2017 to
$232 billion in 2023 [ 40]. However, finding the right balance in loan
products to appeal to both loan applicants and institutions remains
a complex challenge. Online banking and loan comparison services
have empowered applicants to make more informed decisions, in-
creasingly seeking higher loan amounts and lower interest rates.
Meanwhile, institutions are focused on maximizing the utility of
their capital by tweaking loan conditions. Due to constraints such
as government regulations, institutional risk management policies,
and applicants’ needs, there is more room for adjustment in interest
rates than in adjusting loan amounts [ 21]. Nevertheless, the study
of optimizing interest rate strategies has been minimal, primar-
ily relying on risk based pricing (RBP), which is slow and highly
dependent on expert-driven modifications. [16, 39].
Adopting optimization algorithms has improved efficiency in
areas such as inventory management [ 37], dynamic pricing [ 46],
marketing [ 12] and online advertisement [ 9]. In this paper, we
present two ideas to optimize the interest rate strategy: first, mod-
eling the UPL market as a variant of the first price auction; and
second, employing optimization techniques to design interest rate
strategies.

In the UPL market, loan applicants seek the lowest interest rates,
while financial institutions (akin to bidders) try to maximize profits
by increasing the offered interest rate. Financial institutions com-
pete against each other for each loan applicant. Therefore, the UPL
market can be viewed as a repeated auction where the lowest bidder
wins and receives the interest as the reward, with each round of
the repeated auction corresponding to a single loan applicant. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the UPL market
as a kind of auction problem. However, key differences distinguish
the first price auction from the UPL market modelled as auction. In
first price auctions, the winning bid is disclosed to all bidders. In
contrast, lenders are only informed if an applicant chooses them,
without any insight into the bids of competitors or the selected
institution. Furthermore, there exist constraints for lenders in the
loan market: limited budget for loans and the variance in the profit
of their loan portfolio.
In this paper, we present AutoInterest, an adaptation of the on-
line gradient descent algorithm with dual variables that aims to
maximize the cumulative reward (profit). AutoInterest combines
ideas from multi-armed bandit algorithms to incorporate the feed-
back structure of the UPL auction, as well as ideas from the gradient
descent algorithm to consider the loan budget and profit variance
constraints. Unlike the RBP strategy, where interest rates are largely
fixed for every applicant, AutoInterest updates its interest rates after
each applicant to maximize the cumulative profit of the institution.
We test AutoInterest on our open-sourced framework1on the
Default of Credit Cards (Credit Default) dataset [ 47] and the NICE
credit bureau (CB) data of South Korea. The CB dataset is a real-life
dataset of loan applicants from January to March of 2023, with
RBP strategies developed by human experts from PFCT, an online
lending company. This serves as a production-level backtest of
AutoInterest’s performance on the actual UPL market. Through
this framework, we show that our algorithm outperforms the RBP
strategy and other common online learning algorithms.
Our contributions of this work are:
•We model the UPL market as a variant of the first price
auction for the first time.
•We study optimal interest rate strategies as a constrained
optimization problem with budget and variance constraints,
departing from the traditional RBP strategy.
•We develop an algorithm named AutoInterest to solve the
constrained optimization problem online, combining ideas
of multi-armed bandit and dual gradient descent.
•We develop an offline evaluation tool using real-world fi-
nance data to evaluate various interest rate strategies.
•We show that our learning algorithm surpasses the current
interest rate strategies used in financial institutions and other
learning algorithms on the benchmark dataset and on real-
life CB data from South Korea.
2 RELATED WORKS
The multi-armed bandit is a classic problem that finds a balance
between exploration and exploitation to maximize the cumulative
reward. In the simplest case, we select one of the 𝑘possible actions
every round and observe a reward sampled from the stochastic
1https://github.com/seungjungjin-pf/AutoInterestdistribution of the chosen action. As the algorithm can only ob-
serve the reward of chosen actions, it has to explore various arms
while trying to exploit its observed reward. Learning algorithms
for multi-armed bandit include upper confidence bound algorithm
(UCB) [ 4], its variations [ 3,26,32],𝜖-greedy [ 42] and gradient-
based algorithms [ 36]. Several variations of the multi-armed bandit
are related to learning the interest rate strategy. The bandit with
knapsack [ 5,13] problem addresses scenarios with limited budgets,
where the available budget is consumed every round based on the
actions selected. In contextual bandit [ 49], we observe contextual
information for each round before choosing actions.
Learning in repeated auctions has been extensively studied from
both the perspectives of sellers and buyers in various types of
auctions. In the first price auction, the highest bidder wins and pays
its own bid; in the second price auction, the highest bidder wins but
pays the second highest bid. Sellers set a reserve price where sellers
sell only if the winning bid is greater than the reserve price. Sellers
learn how to set reserve prices during repeated auctions [ 2,14,23].
From a bidder’s perspective, the bidder learns a bidding strategy
to maximize its rewards. For the second price auction, it is known
that the optimal bidding strategy is bidding the truthful value [ 38]
regardless of the strategy of other bidders. Therefore, in a second
price auction, when the bidder does not know the true value, the
bidder learns the true value online [ 45]. Furthermore, the bidder
observes additional information about the second highest bid when
the bidder wins. In [ 7], the authors considered cross-learning in
the first price auction with binary feedback where the bidders do
not gain information other than whether the bidders won. In [ 28],
the authors considered the first price auction with partial feedback
where the bidders observe the highest bid when they lose.
Auctions have mainly been studied in the context of online
advertisements [ 10,25,27,44]. Most online advertisements are sold
through real-time auctions on platforms such as Google [ 19,22]
where advertisements with the highest bid win. There are many
areas of research on online advertisement auctions. A pay-per-click
auction studied in [ 20,24,41] is standard in online advertisement
auctions; bidders pay by the number of clicks multiplied by the
bid. In the auto-bidding model setting, the bidder tries to maximize
values such as the number of conversions under the budget and
ROI constraints. As the target for auto-bidding agents is value-
maximizing, the agent might overspend. Therefore, the additional
ROI constraint where the ratio between spending and reward must
be higher than a fixed number is commonly considered. Various
papers study the theoretical properties in auto-bidding settings
such as efficiency, robust design, and price of anarchy [ 1,6,18,33].
In the online setting, an online learning algorithm called pacing is
introduced for repeated second auction with budget constraint [ 8,
10]. These algorithms utilize the property of a second price auction
where information about the highest bid of other bidders can be
observed when the bid is won. In [ 25,27], the authors design an
online learning algorithm for a second price auction with return on
spending (ROS) constraints. On the first price auction, [ 44] devised
an online learning algorithm for the first price auction with a budget
under full feedback and partial feedback.

3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
3.1 Risk Based Pricing
Risk based pricing (RBP) is currently the most prevalent interest rate
strategy in the UPL market [ 21]. This strategy calculates interest
rates by summing the loan applicant’s probability of default (PD),
operational and procurement costs, and the desired return on assets
(ROA) [ 16,39]. Institutions use credit scoring systems either built
internally or provided by credit bureaus, such as FICO in the U.S.
and NICE in South Korea [ 34,35] to evaluate the applicants’ credit
risk factors. Loan applicants are then typically divided into grades
ranging from 1 to 10, where each grade has an expected probability
of default. Operational and procurement costs consist of costs such
as having employees to operate the loans, and costs of financing the
loan. On top of other expenses, human experts set the target ROA
and also make heuristic adjustments to account for other factors
such as economic outlook and additional information regarding the
applicants [ 48]. It should be noted that new RBP on revised ROA
and heuristic adjustments are updated on an irregular basis.
3.2 The Interest Rate as Auction
For loan applicants, financial institutions offer interest rates based
on the applicants’ credit grades evaluated via the institutions’ credit
scoring systems (CSS). The applicant then chooses the institution
that provides the lowest interest rate. Since we are focusing on the
optimization of the interest rates, we assume that every institution
offers the same loan limit equal to the applicants’ desired loan
amount. The applicant will pay back the loan amount along with
the given interest rate. Consequently, this process can be viewed as
a variant of the first price auction with a unique reward structurewhere the lowest bidder, as opposed to the highest, wins. When
an applicant defaults on their loan, the institution incurs losses
equal to the loan amount. Therefore, the expected reward can be
computed as the loan amount multiplied by the difference between
the interest rate and the default rate.
Most institutions maintain a consistent interest rate strategy
over short periods, with any alterations being relatively minor [ 16,
39]. Therefore, we assume that the minimum competing bids for
each grade are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), given
grade. Additionally, we assume that the minimum competing bids
are independent of the loan amount, given grade. In this context,
contrary to the advertisement auction scenario where bids and
values are presumed independent [ 30], the minimum competing bid
is directly linked to the grade. Moreover, due to every institution’s
shared objective of predicting applicant defaults using their own
CSS, the outputs of these systems lead to a correlation between the
bids and grades of institutions. We approach this problem as a multi-
item auction with grades serving as distinct items but, due to shared
budget and variance constraints across grades, we cannot treat each
grade as a distinct auction. In typical auctions, bidders receive either
full or partial feedback on other bidders’ bids upon losing. However,
we only receive information on whether the applicant selected us,
which makes the problem particularly challenging.

interest rate offered by the bidder and 𝑑𝑡,𝑎𝑡represents the minimum
interest rate offered by other institutions for the applicant 𝑡.¯𝑏
represents the maximum possible interest rate that can be offered.
Let the minimum competing interest rate 𝑑𝑡,𝑖be i.i.d sampled from
the distribution 𝐹𝑖given that applicant 𝑡’s credit grade is 𝑖. The
binary variable 1{𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡≤𝑑𝑡,𝑎𝑡}represents whether the bidder
is selected by applicant 𝑡or not. For simplicity of notation, we
define𝐺𝑖=1−𝐹𝑖as the probability of being selected. Note that
𝐺𝑖is unknown to the bidder. Given grade, whether the applicant
𝑡defaults or not is given by the random variable 𝑋𝑡|𝑎𝑡=𝑖∼
𝐵𝑒𝑟(𝑝𝑖), and by taking conditional expectation given grade, we
get𝐸(𝑋𝑡|𝑎𝑡)=𝑝𝑎𝑡. W.L.O.G, we assume operational costs and
procurement costs are zero. Otherwise, we can add operational and
procurement costs to the default rate. The conditional expected
reward is then given by 1{𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡≤𝑑𝑡,𝑎𝑡}·𝑣𝑡·(𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡−𝑝𝑎𝑡).
The institution has a budget 𝐵and let𝜌=𝐵
𝑇be the budget
ratio. The amount of budget consumed for applicant 𝑡is given by
1{𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡≤𝑑𝑡,𝑎𝑡}·𝑣𝑡. Note that the amount of budget we consume
is not related to 𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡, as𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡only affects whether we win the bid.
In addition, the institution needs to maintain the variance of loss
resulting from defaults in its portfolio. Let 𝜎2be the maximum
variance the institution can tolerate and 𝜈=𝜎2
𝑇. As𝑋𝑡∼𝐵𝑒𝑟(𝑝𝑖),
the variance of 𝑋𝑡is given by 𝑝𝑖·(1−𝑝𝑖). Since the institution
gives out loan amount 𝑣𝑡to applicant 𝑡, the variance of loss due to
default is given by 𝑣2
𝑡·(𝑝𝑖)·(1−𝑝𝑖). Note whether the applicant 𝑡
defaults or not is independent of the other applicants. Therefore, the
total variance of the portfolio can be determined asÍ𝑇

The budget constraint is a hard constraint that must be satisfied
and cannot be violated. However, the variance constraint may be
hard or soft, depending on business needs.
4 ALGORITHM
4.1 Initialization
In most online learning algorithms, each action must be explored
at least once. In our setting, the number of actions (possible bids) is
in a similar order to the number of applicants. Therefore, blindly
trying each action once during the exploration stage will consume
most of the budget. We reduce the possible action space by only
considering the bids greater than the estimated default rate. In real
life, the possible interest rate is discrete with a step size of 𝑑, where
𝑑is commonly equal to 0.01%. Therefore, we define the bid space
𝐵𝑖for each grade 𝑖as[𝑝𝑖,𝑝𝑖+𝑑,𝑝𝑖+2𝑑,..., ¯𝑏].
In addition, when we choose an action, we know the result of
other actions. For instance, if an applicant selected our institution
5153Learning to Bid the Interest Rate in Online Unsecured Personal Loans KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
when the bid is 0.1, we know that the applicant would choose us
when we bid any interest rates lower than 0.1. Similarly, if the
applicant did not select us, any bid higher than 0.1 will not get
selected. Therefore, we choose the middle point of bids that have
yet to be selected, reducing the initial exploration to log𝐾instead

4.2 AutoInterest
To solve the constrained optimization problem with budget and
variance constraints, we utilize a primal-dual gradient descent ap-
proach [ 11], which has been utilized for learning to bid in the ad-
vertisement platforms [ 44]. The Lagrangian dual 𝐿of constrained
optimization with dual variables 𝜆1,𝜆2is given by
𝐸𝑑,𝑣,𝑎𝑁∑︁

−𝜆1·𝑣𝑡−𝜆2·𝑣2
𝑡·𝑝𝑖·(1−𝑝𝑖))+1{𝑎𝑡=𝑖}·(𝜆1·𝜌+𝜆2·𝜈)
At each time step, before bidding, we observe credit grade 𝑎𝑡, its
corresponding probability of default 𝑝𝑎𝑡, and loan amount 𝑣𝑡. To
maximize the Lagrangian given dual variables 𝜆1,𝜆2, we need to
bid:
𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡=arg max
𝑏𝐺𝑎𝑡(𝑏)·(𝑣𝑡·(𝑏−𝑝𝑎𝑡)−𝜆1·𝑣𝑡−𝜆2·𝑣2
𝑡·𝑝𝑎𝑡·(1−𝑝𝑎𝑡))
Given𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡, the gradient of the Lagrangian respect to 𝜆1is𝜌−
𝑣𝑡·𝐺𝑎𝑡(𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡)and the gradient of the Lagrangian respect to 𝜆2
is𝜈−𝐺𝑎𝑡(𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡)·(1−𝑝𝑎𝑡)·𝑝𝑎𝑡. We update dual variables using
gradient descent.
As the bid space 𝐵𝑖is discrete, we can treat 𝐺𝑖discrete and
represent𝐺𝑖with an array of length 𝐵𝑖. Let𝐶𝑖be an array of the
number of times a bid has been made for grade 𝑖and𝑡𝑖as the
sum of elements of 𝐶𝑖.𝑅𝑖represents an array of the frequency of
selection when this interest rate is offered to applicants for grade 𝑖.
For simplicity of the notation, for each element 𝑏𝑖in𝐵𝑖, the value
of the corresponding element in array 𝐺𝑖,𝐶𝑖,𝑅𝑖is represented as
𝐺𝑖[𝑏𝑖],𝐶𝑖[𝑏𝑖],𝑅𝑖[𝑏𝑖], where𝑏𝑖indexes the position of the element
within array 𝐵𝑖.Contrary to the bidding algorithm in [ 44], we do not gain any
knowledge about other institutions’ bids. Therefore, we need to
estimate𝐺𝑖[𝑏𝑖]from the previous history of selections to compute
thearg max . We estimate 𝐺𝑖[𝑏𝑡,𝑖]using the previous history of
bidding and the response of the loan applicants to the bids. The
estimate of ˜𝐺𝑖[𝑏𝑡,𝑖]:=𝑅𝑖[𝑏𝑡,𝑖]/𝐶𝑖[𝑏𝑡,𝑖]
In [17], the authors present the SGD-UCB algorithm, which com-
bines UCB with stochastic gradient descent(SGD) for constrained
optimization with bandit feedback. Motivated by this, we use a
UCB-like algorithm to promote the exploration of 𝑏𝑖while estimat-
ing𝐺𝑖[𝑏𝑖]. For the interest rate, as the bid increases, the reward
increases if selected. Therefore, exploring a high interest rate has
a higher worth than exploring a low interest rate. To promote ex-
ploration of higher interest rates, instead of using the confidence
of UCB√︂
2 log𝑡𝑖
𝐶𝑖[𝑏𝑡,𝑖], we use adjusted confidence of√︂
2 log𝑡𝑖𝛿[𝑏𝑡,𝑖]
𝐶𝑖[𝑏𝑡,𝑖],
where𝛿is the relative ranking of the bid in the bid space.
In [7], updating the reward for every input context is studied,
suggesting cross-learning. While we cannot use cross-learning di-
rectly because other institutions’ bids correlate with the context, we
partially adapt this idea by updating the reward for multiple bids at
once using the property of the first price auction. After offering 𝑏𝑡,𝑖
to the applicants, we observe whether 𝑅𝑖,𝐶𝑖is updated similarly to
the initialization process shown in section 4.1.
A pseudo-code for AutoInterest that combines these ideas is
shown in Algorithm 2.
5 OFFLINE EXPERIMENT
To evaluate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm, we de-
veloped a framework that provides an auction setting where the
bidder with the lowest interest rate wins. We test five types of bid-
ding strategies: AutoInterest, UCB[ 4],𝜖-greedy[ 43], Actor-Critic
algorithm[ 31] and RBP, on other generated RBP strategies. We con-
sider RBP strategies fixed during the whole time period because
the update frequency of RBPs is irregular in real life, and the pe-
riod considered is relatively short. Fixed RBP is the main baseline
to be compared as it is the most prevalent algorithm used in the
UPL market. Considering each bid as possible arms, we compare
AutoInterest with 3 common multi-armed bandit algorithms. In this
setting, every institution has equal loan budgets, and the budget
is subtracted only when a given institution’s bid wins the auction.
We test on various loan budgets, expressed as a fractional multiple
of the total sum of applied loan amounts shown in 1. For example,
a multiple of1
5indicates the institution being able to fund1
5of
the whole UPL market. The reward on each bid is calculated by
multiplying the loan amount by the difference between the bid and
the expected default rate of the applicant. For example, with a loan
application $100, an expected default rate of 5%, a bid of 5.2% will
yield a reward of $0.2. We show experimental results of various
bidding strategies against 10 RBP strategies on the Credit Default
dataset and also backtest on the CB dataset. We open-sourced the
framework to allow others to test the learning algorithms on their
internal financial datasets. All numbers for rewards shown in the
following figures and tables are in the units of 10,000 Korean Won,
which is around $8 US Dollars.

The Credit Default dataset has 30,000 instances and 23 features
aimed at studying credit card default payments in Taiwan. We
trained two binary classifiers to predict default using random for-
est [ 29] and xgboost [ 15]. Loan applicants are divided into ten
grades based on the output of the models, with each grade associ-
ated with an expected probability of default. We set aside 20% of the
dataset as the test dataset, and of those, we restrict to grades that
have an expected default of less than 20%, yielding about 3.3k sam-
ples. This hard upper limit to the interest rate adheres to regulations
where interest rates above 20%
5.2 CB Data
In South Korea, there are multiple loan comparison services where
users can get interest rates from different institutions in one sitting.
During the instance of a loan inquiry from an applicant, financial
institutions receive the applicant’s credit data from the Korean
credit bureau, NICE. The CB dataset is comprised of 300k appli-
cants, and of those, about 48k have actually received a loan from
2023.01∼2023.03. Five CSS systems developed by a South Korean
online lending company, PFC Technologies and NICE CB Score,
were chosen as possible credit scoring systems. Based on these 6
CSS models, 50 experts from PFC Technologies were divided into
16 teams, resulting in 914 distinct fixed RBP strategies. We compare
AutoInterest against ten randomly selected fixed RBP strategies
every run and report the results. Similar to the Credit Default set-
ting, we create our test dataset by setting aside the test set and
then restricting again on grades with less than 20% of the expected
default rate - yielding a set of around 16k samples.
6 RESULT
We would want to point out that the maximum reward an institu-
tion can achieve depends on the strategy of other institutions. For
example, if there exists an unrealistic institution with unlimited
loan volume that bids 0 for all applicants, the best achievable profit
is 0 - there exists no strategy that can compete with 0% interest.

Similarly, if all other institutions bid high interest rates, the maxi-
mum reward the institution can achieve would be higher. Therefore,
it is meaningless to compare the rewards of algorithms when the
strategies of other institutions change. The importance is the rela-
tive position of the given algorithm compared to other algorithms
in the same setting. We show two tables where table 1 shows the
relative ranking of algorithms over the wide range of strategies of
competing institutions, and table 2 shows the average reward of
algorithms when the strategies of other institutions are fixed. For
this section, we only consider the budget constraint instead and
ignore the variance constraint. This is because budget is the main
constraint in real life. In section 7.3, we show the case where we
consider both variance and budget constraints.
6.1 Ranking of Algorithms
Each bidding algorithm was tested against the same ten randomly
generated fixed RBP strategies. The ranking of each algorithm was
then calculated by looking at the resulting profit. This experiment
was repeated 100 times over six different budget multipliers, and
the results are shown in Table 1 - the top half is tested on the Credit
Default dataset, and the bottom half is on the CB dataset. We also
show the graph of the cumulative reward for various budget mul-
tiples for one specific instance in Fig 2. While all online learning
algorithms, including AutoInterest, are able to outrank the tradi-
tional fixed RBP strategy on both datasets, on the Credit Default
dataset, AutoInterest ranks the highest for multipliers from1
10up
to1
5. Since AutoInterest considers the constraints at every step,
the relative performance of AutoInterest degrades as the budget
becomes a non-limiting factor. However, even the1
5multiplier for
a single institution is unrealistic - it would represent an institution
having1
5of the multi-billion dollar UPL market. A similar trend of
AutoInterest’s ranking going down with higher multipliers is also
shown in the CB dataset; however, in this case, it is not enough
for UCB to outrank AutoInterest. The reasoning for AutoInterest’s
dominance on the CB dataset stems from the fact that since there
are more applicants, there is more time for the algorithm to catch up
on its sub-optimal bidding during the earlier stages of exploration.6.2 Reward of Algorithms
To test the reward of AutoInterest, we fixed the other institutions’
strategies and instead shuffled the dataset and compared the mean
and std of the reward against other algorithms. The result is shown
in Table 2. In both the Credit Default and CB datasets, AutoInterest
has the highest cumulative reward, and the fixed RBP is significantly
weaker than other learning algorithms. Furthermore, the mean
reward for AutoInterest, as compared to UCB’s mean reward in the
CB dataset, is much higher than that of Credit Default.
7 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS
7.1 Bids of AutoInterest
The bids for grade 5,6 for both Credit Default and CB data can be
seen in Fig 3. We only show grade 6 here since the default rate for
grade 5,6 is relatively high; there’s more room for variation in the
bid values among the competing institutions. For the low multiplier
of1
8, the algorithm can be more selective on its bid, resulting in
higher overall bid values. One interesting behavior of AutoInterest
can be seen on the budget multiple of1
8, where the bid seems to
be oscillating back and forth between a high and low bid value.
AutoInterest tries to maintain a constant rate of consumption. As
the constant rate is smaller in lower budget settings, the algorithm
changes its bid more drastically for each applicant 𝑡to balance
reward maximization and budget use.

7.2 Without budget constraint
Figure 4 shows the effects of the learning rate on the budget con-
straint. Since the possible step size of the bid in the experiment is
0.001,𝜖1is chosen such that 𝜆1is of a similar magnitude to the step
size. While the cumulative reward is significantly lower in the case
where the budget constraint is completely ignored, the rewards for
𝜖1values ranging from 10−6to10−4are similar. This shows that
the performance of AutoInterest does not depend on 𝜖1.

7.3 Variance Constraint
We consider the case where both the budget and variance con-
straints are considered hard limits. The variance constraint acts to
add to the predictability of the algorithm’s profit. While the variance
constraint doesn’t improve the cumulative reward as much when
compared to the budget constraint, we can still see that non-zero
values of𝜖2increase the cumulative reward.

visioning the interest rate strategies. We modeled the UPL mar-
ket as an auction problem, marking a novel departure from an

industry perspective. We have presented AutoInterest, an online
learning algorithm that finds the optimal strategy for any opposing
strategy. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive framework for
offline testing of the algorithm’s efficacy. Our empirical analysis,
conducted on both the widely-used Credit Default dataset against
simulated RBP strategies and on the CB dataset featuring bidding
strategies devised by human experts, demonstrates the effectiveness
of AutoInterest.
Fixed RBP strategies have shortcomings due to human experts’
reliance on heuristic decision-making. This approach is inherently
suboptimal, as it fails to account for the complex dynamics of the
UPL market. AutoInterest considers both the default rate of loan
applicants and the competing institutions’ strategy to optimize
the bidding strategy. As a result, AutoInterest consistently out-
performs RBP strategies in terms of profitability, a critical metric
within the UPL market landscape. This underscores the potential
of adopting optimization algorithms to enhance the market perfor-
mance of financial institutions. Moreover, we compare AutoInterest
with other online algorithms UCB and the 𝜖-greedy algorithm.
We demonstrated that AutoInterest outperforms other online al-
gorithms under limited budgets. This setting reflects real-world
dynamics where no single financial institution dominates the en-
tire UPL market, highlighting the relevance and effectiveness of
AutoInterest in practical settings.
For future work, we hope to analyze various properties of the
UPL market further through the lens of the auction beyond find-
ing the bidding strategy for profit maximization. For example, we
can explore concepts such as the price of anarchy, the equilibrium,
and robust design to gain a more comprehensive understanding
of the UPL market dynamics. In addition, we could theoretically
find the upper bound of cumulative regret of AutoInterest to study
its properties. Furthermore, given AutoInterest’s reliance on CSS
to calculate expected default rates, it would be valuable to investi-
gate the extent to which CSS performance impacts our algorithm’s
effectiveness.

A EXPERIMENT DETAILS
A.1 Credit Default CSS
The Credit Dataset was split into 72% train, 8% valid and 20% test
set. The train and valid sets were used to train the model and to
create the bins for grades. The test set was solely used to evaluate
AutoInterest on figures 1 through 5. Two models using random
forest classifier from sklearn and xgboost classifer from the xgboost
library were trained with default parameters. Columns x12 through
x23 were fit by sklearn’s Standard Scaler on the train dataset. All
train, valid and test were then transformed with the scaler. Each
competing institution was given a 50-50 chance of using the xgb
model or the rf model. To meet regulatory requirements regarding
interest rates in South Korea, grades with a default probability of
20% on either of the models are omitted. The default probability on
each grade is shown in table 3.

A.2 Risk Based Pricing
Risk based pricing, 𝑋𝑡is sampled from a beta distribution with
parameters 𝛼=0.1and beta𝛽=0.90which centers the beta
distribution with mean 𝜇=0.1. The values for the interest rate,𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡is then calculated as 𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡=(1+𝑝𝑎𝑡)·𝑋𝑡, where𝑎𝑡is the credit
grade,𝑝𝑎𝑡is the default rate at a given grade, and 𝑋𝑡∼𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎(𝛼,𝛽).
A.3 UCB and E-Greedy
Both UCB and 𝜖-greedy algorithms were initialized with initializa-
tion shown in 4.1. The epsilon value of 𝜖-greedy was 0.5.
A.4 Cumulative Reward of Algorithms
Cumulative reward in figure 2 shows single run test results on
budget multiples of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 on both the Credit Default
dataset and CB dataset. The epsilon value for the budget constraint
is2·10−6.

3. The variance multiplier is not used here.
The budget is the total sum of loan amounts multiplied by the given
multiplier, where each loan amount, 𝑣𝑡is sampled from a normal
distribution of 𝜇=2700 and𝜎=500which resembles the loan
amount values from the CB dataset. Each multiplier is tested on 100
different seeds on the random generator. At the beginning of each
test, the ten competing institutions generate interest rates on grades
1 through 6 with the RBP strategy, and each institution is given a
budget. On every round, every bid is according to their strategy, and
the winning institution receives a reward of (𝑏𝑡,𝑎𝑡−𝑝𝑎𝑡)·𝑣𝑡. The
winning institution subtracts the loan amount from the remaining
budget when the budget runs out.
A.6 Reward of Algorithms
The experiment result of table 2 shows the reward and std of each
algorithm in a fixed setting - the RBP strategy of the institutions
is fixed with a budget multiplier of1
8and the variance constraint
is not used. The changing part of the experiment is the order of
the number of applicants; with each iteration, the order of the
applicants is shuffled.
A.7 Bids of Interest
The bid values shown in figure 3 are in the setting of budget multi-
plier1
8on grade 6 for the Credit Default and CB datasets. The bid
values for which AutoInterest has made a bid, whether it was a win
or not, are shown in the figure.
A.8 AutoIntereset vs. AutoInterest
The result shown in figure 6 are in the setting of budget multiplier
of1
8.
A.9 Without Budget Constraint
The mean and the std of the cumulative reward in the setting of
the budget multiple of1
8is shown in figure 4.
A.10 Variance Constraint
The effects of the variance constraint shown in figure 5 have the
budget multiplier at1
8and variance multiplier at1
16. The variance
multiplier was purposefully chosen to be lower than the budget
multiplier such that the variance multiplier would become the
bottleneck for every institution. In this setting, the total allowable
