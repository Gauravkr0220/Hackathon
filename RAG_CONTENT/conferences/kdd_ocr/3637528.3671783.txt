ABSTRACT
Feasible solutions are crucial for Integer Programming (IP) since
they can substantially speed up the solving process. In many applica-
tions, similar IP instances often exhibit similar structures and shared
solution distributions, which can be potentially modeled by deep
learning methods. Unfortunately, existing deep-learning-based al-
gorithms, such as Neural Diving [ 21] and Predict-and-search frame-
work [ 8], are limited to generating only partial feasible solutions,
and they must rely on solvers like SCIP and Gurobi to complete the
solutions for a given IP problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that generates complete feasible solutions end-to-end.
Our framework leverages contrastive learning to characterize the
relationship between IP instances and solutions, and learns latent
embeddings for both IP instances and their solutions. Further, the
framework employs diffusion models to learn the distribution of
solution embeddings conditioned on IP representations, with a ded-
icated guided sampling strategy that accounts for both constraints
and objectives. We empirically evaluate our framework on four
typical datasets of IP problems, and show that it effectively gen-
erates complete feasible solutions with a high probability (> 89.7
%) without the reliance of Solvers and the quality of solutions is
comparable to the best heuristic solutions from Gurobi. Further-
more, by integrating our method’s sampled partial solutions with
the CompleteSol heuristic from SCIP [ 19], the resulting feasible
solutions outperform those from state-of-the-art methods across
all datasets, exhibiting a 3.7 to 33.7% improvement in the gap to
optimal values, and maintaining a feasible ratio of over 99.7% for
all datasets.

1 Introduction
Integer Programming (IP) in the field of operation research is a class
of optimization problems where some or all of the decision variables
are constrained to be integers [ 36]. Despite their importance in a
wide range of applications such as production planning [ 25,30],
resource allocation [ 12], and scheduling [ 23,29,35], IP is known
to be NP-hard and in general very difficult to solve. For decades,
a significant effort has been made to develop sophisticated algo-
rithms and efficient solvers, e.g., branch-and-bound [ 16], cutting
plane method [ 13] and large neighborhood search algorithms [ 24].
These methods, however, can be computationally expensive be-
cause the search space for large-scale problems can be exponentially
large. Moreover, these algorithms rely heavily on a feasible solu-
tion input that will crucially determine the whole search process.
Consequently, existing solvers, such as SCIP [ 19] and Gurobi [ 7],
firstly employ heuristic algorithms to identify high-quality feasible
solutions that serve as initial starting points for the optimization
process. However, the heuristic algorithms usually fail to capture
the similar structure among different IP instances and the quality of
initial solutions is usually low. Hence, having a data-driven method
that produces high-quality feasible solutions for any IP instances is
desirable for many real-world applications.
To generate feasible solutions, prior works [ 8,21,38] have em-
ployed the advantage of deep learning to capture similarity of the
IP instances from the same domain in order to expedite solving. For
4107
KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Hao Zeng et al.
presenting IP instances via neural network, Neural Diving [ 21,38]
adopt the methodology delineated by Gasse et al . [5], which models
the formulation of IP instances as bipartite graphs and subsequently
leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to derive variable fea-
tures from these graph representations. Subsequently, a solution
prediction task is employed to learn the relationship between IP
instances and their solutions, with the aim of directly predicting
those solutions. However, it is difficult to produce complete feasible
solutions as it fails to explicitly integrate objective and constraint
information during the sampling process. Neural Diving thus focus
on generating partial solutions by GNN, where only a subset of
variables is assigned values using neural networks. Importantly,
in many cases, the proportion of variables predicted by the neural
network is set at a relatively low ratio (less than 50%) to ensure
feasibility. Furthermore, such methods tend to be inefficient, primar-
ily due to the introduction of auxiliary problems for filling in the
remaining variables. For instance, the Completesol heuristic [ 19], a
classical approach, solves an auxiliary integer programming model
which is constructed by adding constraints to fix the variables
from partial solutions. Nonetheless, infeasibility can arise in auxil-
iary problems due to the potential for partial assignments to clash
with the initial constraints. To deal with infeasible assignments,
in another approach, Han et al . [8] proposes a predict-and-search
algorithm which constructs a trust region based on predicted partial
solutions and then search for high-quality feasible solutions via
a solver. In summary, these methods require the construction of
auxiliary problems to obtain feasible solutions and fail to utilize the
complete information from the IP instance, as only partial variables
are assigned. This situation highlights the necessity for creating an
end-to-end deep learning framework capable of generating com-
plete and feasible solutions for IP problems.
Recently, diffusion models [ 9,31] have exhibited notable advan-
tages in various generative tasks, primarily owing to their supe-
rior mode-coverage and diversity [ 2]. Notable applications include
high-fidelity image generation [ 4], image-segmentation [ 1], and
text-to-image synthesis [ 28]. These successes motivates the launch
of an investigation into harnessing the generative capability of
diffusion models for acquiring feasible solutions of IP problems.
To this end, we introduce a comprehensive end-to-end gener-
ative framework presented in Figure 1 to produce high-quality
feasible solutions for IP problems. First of all, stemming inspira-
tion from DALL.E-2 [28] for text-to-image translation, we employ
a multimodal contrastive learning approach, akin to the CLIP Al-
gorithm [ 27], to obtain embeddings for an IP instance 𝑖, denoted
asz𝑖, and solution embeddings zxfor solutions x(Section 3). Sub-
sequently, we employ DDPM [ 9] to model the distribution of zx
conditioned on z𝑖(Section 3). During this phrase, a decoder is con-
currently trained with the task of solution reconstruction (Section
3). Finally, to enhance the quality of the feasible solutions during the
sampling process, we propose the IP-guided sampling approaches
tailored for both DDPM and DDIM [ 33] which explicitly consider
both constraints and objectives during sampling. Our experimental
results shown in Section 5 substantiate the efficacy of this approach
in generating complete and feasible solutions for a given IP in-
stance with a higher probability. Besides, by combining with the
CompleteSol heuristic, the solutions from our methods have better
quality than the state-of-the-art. Importantly, to the best of ourknowledge, our approach is the first to have the ability to gener-
ate complete and feasible solutions using pure neural techniques,
without relying on any solvers.
2 Background
Integer Programming and Its Representations. Integer pro-
gramming (IP) is a class of NP-hard problems where the goal is to
optimize a linear objective function, subject to linear and integer
constraints. Without loss of generality, we focus on minimization
which can be formulated as follows,
minxc⊤x subject to Ax≤b, x∈Z𝑛(1)
where c∈R𝑛denotes the objective coefficient, A=[a⊤
1,a⊤
2,...,a⊤𝑚]∈
R𝑚×𝑛is the coefficient matrix of constraints and b=[𝑏1,𝑏2,...,𝑏𝑚]⊤∈
R𝑚represents the right-hand-side vector. For simplicity, we fo-
cus on binary integer variables, where xtakes values in{0,1}𝑛.
Throughout this paper, we adopt the term IP instance to denote a
specific instance within the domain of some Integer Programming
(IP) problem.
Bipartite graph representation, proposed by Gasse et al . [5], is a
commonly used and useful way to extract features of an IP instance
for machine learning purposes. This representation, see the left part
of Figure 1 (a) for an example, divides the constraints and variables
into two different sets of nodes, and uses a Graph Convolution
Network (GCN) to learn the representation of nodes. Recently, Nair
et al. [21] proposed several changes to the architecture of GCN
for performance improvements. Therefore, in this work, we use
the bipartite graph structure combined with GCN to extract the
embeddings of IP instances (see [5, 21] for more details).
DDPM and DDIM. Diffusion models learn a data distribution
by reversing a gradual noising process. In the DDPM method [ 9],
when presented with a data point sampled from an actual data
distribution, denoted as z(0)
x∼𝑞(zx), a diffusion model, as de-
scribed in [ 9,31], typically involves two distinct phases. In the
forward process, a sequence of Gaussian noise is incrementally
added to the initial sample over a span of 𝑇steps, guided by a
variance schedule denoted as 𝛽1,𝛽2,...,𝛽𝑇. This process yields a
sequence of noisy samples z(1)
x,z(2)
x,...,z(𝑇)
x. Subsequently, the tran-
sition for the forward process can be described as: 𝑞(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡−1)
x)=
N(z(𝑡)
x;√︁
1−𝛽𝑡z(𝑡−1)
x,𝛽𝑡I). In fact, z(𝑡)
xcan be sampled at any time
step𝑡in a closed form employing the notations 𝛼𝑡:=1−𝛽𝑡and
¯𝛼:=Î𝑡
𝑠=1𝛼𝑠,z(𝑡)
x=√¯𝛼𝑡z(0)
x+√1−¯𝛼𝑡𝝐, where 𝝐∼N( 0,I). In
the reverse process (denoising process), we need to model the dis-
tribution of z(𝑡−1)
x given z(𝑡)
xas a Gaussian distribution, which
implies that 𝑝𝜃(z(𝑡−1)
x|z(𝑡)
x)=N
z(𝑡−1)
x ;𝝁𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,𝑡),Σ𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,𝑡)
,
where the variance Σ𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,𝑡)can be fixed to a known constant [ 9]
or learned with a separate neural network [ 22], while the mean
can be approximately computed by adding z(0)
xas a condition,
𝝁𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,𝑡)=√𝛼𝑡(1−¯𝛼𝑡−1)
1−¯𝛼𝑡z(𝑡)
x+√¯𝛼𝑡−1𝛽𝑡
1−¯𝛼𝑡z(0)
x.
To improve the efficiency of sampling of DDPM, DDIM [ 33]
formulates an alternative non-Markovian noising process with the
same forward marginals as DDPM, but rewrites the probability
𝑝𝜃(z(𝑡−1)
x|z(𝑡)
x)in reverse process as a desired standard deviation

constraints.

3 Model Architecture
Our training dataset consists of pairs (𝑖,x)of IP instance and their
corresponding one feasible solution x. Given an instance 𝑖, let
z𝑖∈R𝑛×𝑑andzx∈R𝑛×𝑑be the embeddings of the IP instance 𝑖
and the solution xrespectively, where 𝑛is the number of variables
and𝑑is the embedding dimension. It is worth noting that a IP
instance can have multiple different feasible solutions, meaning
that model need to learn the distribution of feasible solutions by
conditioning on a given IP instance. Our methods do not directly ap-
ply a diffusion model to learn the distribution of solutions. Instead,
we use an encoder to transform the solutions x∈{0,1}𝑛from a
discrete space to a continuous embedding space, e.g. zx∈R𝑛×𝑑.
We then construct a diffusion model to learn the distribution of the
solution embeddings given an IP embedding z𝑖. Finally, a decoder is
trained to recover the predicted solution ˆxfrom the embedding zx.
To effectively build the connection between the IP instance 𝑖and so-
lution x, we first apply Contrastive IP-Solution Pre-training (CISP)
module, motivated by CLIP [ 27] which is used for text-to-image
generation, to produce IP embedding z𝑖and solution embedding
zx. Overall, our model consists of three key components:
•aContrastive IP-Solution Pre-training (CISP) module that pro-
duces IP embeddings z𝑖and solution embeddings zx;
•adiffusion module 𝑝(zx|z𝑖)that generates solution embed-
ding zxconditioned on IP embedding z𝑖;
•and a decoder module 𝑝(x|zx,z𝑖)that recovers solution x
from embedding zxconditioned on IP embedding z𝑖.
We provide more details on each module in the following sections.Contrastive IP-Solution Pre-training. Previous works [ 8,21]
show the crucial importance of establishing the connection be-
tween the IP instances and the solutions, and propose to implicitly
learn this connection through the task of predicting feasible so-
lutions. These approaches may not exhibit strong generalization
capabilities on new instances because they only utilize the collected
solutions in dataset without considering feasibility explicitly during
training. To more effectively capture this relationship, we propose
to employ a contrastive learning task to learn representations for
IP instances and embeddings for solutions by constructing feasi-
ble and infeasible solutions. The intuition behind is to ensure that
the IP embeddings stay close to the embeddings of their feasible
solutions, and away from the embeddings of the infeasible ones.
To avoid explicitly constructing infeasible solutions, we proposed
Contrastive IP-Solution Pre-training (CISP) algorithm to train IP
encoder and solution encoder. Specifically, for IP encoder, we ex-
tract the representation of IP instances via a bipartite graph as [ 5],
and use the structure of GCNs from Neural Diving [ 21] to generate
all variables’ embeddings as IP embeddings z𝑖. For solution encoder,
we use the encoder of the transformer to obtain the representa-
tions of each variable as solution embeddings zx. Both zxandz𝑖
have the same dimension to compute pairwise cosine similarities
later. Since the number of variables in different IP instances may
vary, we perform zero-padding on z𝑖and dummy-padding on x(i.e.
padding 2 for 0-1 integer programming) to align the dimensions.
The zero-padding for z𝑖is done to ensure that the cosine similarity
remains unaffected. CISP algorithm then learns to maximize the
similarity between embeddings of IP and corresponding solution
pairs, and to minimize the similarity between the embeddings of
incorrect pairs, which is achieved through optimizing a symmetric
cross-entropy loss, as detailed in Appendix A.1.
Diffusion Generation. To leverage diffusion models for gen-
erating feasible solutions (discrete variables), we use the solution
embedding zx∈R𝑛×𝑑from the aforementioned CISP as the objec-
tive of generation. In addition, z𝑖is considered as a condition for
4109KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Hao Zeng et al.
generating high-quality results. According to [ 9], we parameterize

,(3)
∀𝑡∈[𝑇,𝑇−1,...,1]in reverse process, where z(0)
x=zx. Different
from predicting the noise of each step in a general diffusion training
phase, we predict zxdirectly as it empirically performs better. The
training loss is defined as follows,

Solution Decoding. The decoder d𝜙plays a crucial role in recon-
structing the solution xfrom the solution embedding zx. To enhance
the robustness of the solution recovery, we jointly train the decoder
d𝜙with the diffusion model. Specifically, we concatenate the solu-
tion embedding ˆzx=f𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,𝑡)generated by the diffusion model
with the IP embedding z𝑖, and use the concatenated vector as in-
put to a transformer encoder to obtain the reconstructed solution
ˆx=d𝜙(ˆzx,z𝑖). This process is associated with the cross-entropy
loss defined as:LCE≜−Ex[logˆx]=−Ex
logd𝜙(ˆzx,z𝑖). To ex-
plicitly account for constraints in the training process, we introduce
a penalty term to measure the degree of constraint violation. More
specifically, let a𝑇
𝑘be the𝑘th row of matrix Ain(1), the constraint
violation (CV) loss is defined as LCV≜1
𝑚Í𝑚
𝑘=1max(a𝑇
𝑘ˆx−𝑏𝑘,0),
where𝑚is the number of constraints. The total loss for training
diffusion and decoder therefore consists of the three parts:
L=LMSE+L CE+𝜆LCV, (5)
where𝜆is a hyper-parameter to regulate the penalty. The full
training procedure is given in Algorithm 1 and the training details
can be found in Appendix A.4.
4 IP Guided Sampling
Once the models have been trained, we can then sample variable
assignments by running the sampling algorithm of DDPM or DDIM
from a random Gaussian noise z(𝑇)
x∼N( 0,I). Interestingly we
find that, without suitable guidance, diffusion model is prone to
generate inaccurate distributions, e.g. violating constraints for a
given IP instance as shown in section 5.1. We thus consider theAlgorithm 1 Training diffusion and solution decoder

DDPM and DDIM, of which the latter is faster and better in terms
of the quality and feasibility, as shown in Section 5.
4.1 IP Guided Diffusion Sampling
Consider a conditional diffusion model 𝑝𝜃(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡+1)
x,z𝑖), we first
introduce constraint guidance by designing each transition proba-
bility as
𝑝𝜃,𝜙(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡+1)
x,z𝑖,A,b)=𝑍𝑝𝜃(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡+1)
x,z𝑖)𝑒−𝑠𝑐𝜙(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,A,b),
(6)
where𝑠is the gradient scale, 𝑍is a normalizing constant and
𝑐𝜙(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,A,b)=Í𝑚
𝑘=1max(a𝑇
𝑘d𝜙(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖)−𝑏𝑘,0)measures the
violation of constraints. Let 𝝁andΣbe the mean and variance of
the Gaussian distribution representing 𝑝𝜃,𝜙(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡+1)
x,z𝑖). Then,
log𝑝𝜃(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡+1)
x,z𝑖)=−1
2(z(𝑡)
x−𝝁)𝑇Σ−1(z(𝑡)
x−𝝁)+𝐶, where𝐶
is a constant. Consider the Taylor expansion for 𝑐𝜙atz(𝑡)
x=𝝁,
𝑐𝜙(z(𝑡)

≈𝑐𝜙(𝝁,z𝑖,A,b)+( z(𝑡)

where g=∇z(𝑡)
x𝑐𝜙(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,A,b)|z(𝑡)
x=𝝁and𝐶1is a constant. Similar
to Classifier Guidance [ 4], we assume that 𝑐𝜙(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,A,b)has low
curvature compared to Σ−1and thus have the following,
log(𝑝𝜃,𝜙(z(𝑡)
x|z(𝑡+1)

denoising transition 𝑝𝜃,𝜙(z(𝑡)

x,z𝑖,A,b)can be approximated
by a Gaussian distribution with a mean shifted by −𝑠Σg. We can
further inject the objective guidance to transition probability for
acquiring high-quality solutions,

4.2 Non-Markovian IP Guided Sampling
For the non-Markovian sampling scheme as used in DDIM, the
method for conditional sampling is no longer invalid. To guide
the sampling process, existing studies [ 4,10] used the score-based
conditioning trick from Song et al . [34] to construct a new epsilon
prediction. We found that this trick turns out ineffective in our prob-
lem setting, possibly due to unique difficulties of finding feasible
solutions in IP instances.
Instead, we find that adding a direction that guides the pre-
dicted solution to constraint region in each step of reverse pro-
cess helps generate more reasonable solutions. Specifically, we
first generate the predicted noise according to ˆz(0)
x=𝑓𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,𝑡),
𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃=z(𝑡)
x−√¯𝛼𝑡ˆz(0)
x√1−¯𝛼𝑡. According to (2), the transition equation of
DDIM for z(𝑡−1)
x from a sample z(𝑡)
xcan be written as
z(𝑡−1)
x =√¯𝛼𝑡f𝜃(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,𝑡)+√︃
1−¯𝛼𝑡−1−𝜎2
𝑡𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃+𝜎𝑡𝝐𝑡.(8)
where the first term is the prediction of z(0)
xand the second term
is the direction pointing to z(𝑡)
x. To consider constraints in (1), we
modify 𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃by adding the direction of minimizing sum of constraint
violation, that is
ˆ𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃=𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃−𝑠∇z(𝑡)
x𝑐𝜙(z(𝑡)
x,z𝑖,A,b), (9)
where𝑠is gradient scale. By replacing 𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃in(8)with ˆ𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃, we
obtain Non-Makovian Constraint Guided Sampling, which guides
the solution generated in each transition to approach constraint
region. Equivalently, it is to perform a gradient descent step with
a step-size shrinking to zero as 𝑡→0when𝜎𝑡→0. To further
consider the objective function together with the constraint, we
can update 𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃as follows:
ˆ𝝐(𝑡)
𝜃=𝝐(𝑡)

,(10)where𝛾∈[0,1]is the leverage factor for balancing constraint and
objective. This method is called Non-Markovian IP Guided Diffusion
Sampling, as presented in Algorithm 3 .

5 Experiments
This section empirically investigates the effectiveness of our method
in solving IP instances. The efficacy is evaluated with two metrics:
feasible ratio andobjective value. The feasible ratio measures the pro-
portion of feasible solutions among all sampled solutions and the
objective value obtained from the generated feasible solutions mea-
sures the solution quality. Additionally, we also present gap between
feasible solution 𝑥and optimal solution 𝑥∗via|c𝑇(x−x∗)|
max(|c𝑇x|,|c𝑇x∗|)for
comparing the performance more clearly.
We evaluate our methods on four IP datasets generated by the
Ecole library [26]:
•Set Cover (SC) is to find the least number of subsets that cover a
given universal set.
•Capacitated Facility Location (CF) is to locate a number of facilities
to serve the sites with a given demand and the aim is minimize
the total cost.
•Combinatorial Auction (CA) is to help bidders place unrestricted
bids for bundles of goods and the aim is to maximize the revenue.
•Independent Set (IS) is to find the maximum subset of nodes of
an undirected graph such that no pair of nodes are connected.
We compare the performance of our approach with state-of-the-art
methods including Neural Diving (ND) [ 21], the Predict-and-Search
algorithm (PS) [ 8], and heuristic solutions from SCIP 8.0.1 [ 3] and
Gurobi 9.5.2 [ 7]. Detailed descriptions of the datasets and baseline
methods are provided in Appendix A.3. Moreover, we incorporate
the best objective values, which serve as the ground truth, acquired
by executing Gurobi on each instance for a duration of 100 seconds.
To ensure clarity, we use IP Guided DDPM to denote the (Markovian)
IP Guided Diffusion sampling in Section 4.1, and IP Guided DDIM
to represent the Non-Markovian IP Guided Diffusion sampling in
Section 4.2.
In the following, we first illustrate the guided diffusion sampling
and emphasize its distinctions to Neural Diving and vanilla genera-
tion process in diffusion models in Section 5.1. Further, we evaluate
the feasibility and quality of solutions generated by IP guided DDIM
across all four datasets in Section 5.2. Furthermore, we conduct

proaches and contrastive learning in Section 5.3. In Section 5.4, we
demonstrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to larger
instances and present the outcomes of qualitative analysis of solu-
tions. All experiments are performed in a workstation with two In-
tel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8163 CPU @ 2.50GHz, 176GB ram and two
Nvidia V100 GPUs. We also provide the total training and inference
time in Appendix A.5. The detailed hyper-parameters for IP guided
sampling can be found in Appendix A.6. The codes can be found
in: https://github.com/agent-lab/diffusion-integer-programming.
5.1 Illustrative experiments
The maximal independent set problem involves finding the largest
subset of nodes in an undirected graph where no two nodes are con-
nected. We focus on an illustrative example: a graph consisting of
15 nodes and 22 edges. This graph can be transformed into an inte-
ger programming (IP) instance with 15 variables and 22 constraints.
The graph is depicted in Figure 3, and we present the results from
Neural Diving, and from the different time steps of unguided DDIM
and IP Guided DDIM. Among the three algorithms, Neural Diving
fixes only three node values and uses the Completesol heuristic to
find an independent set containing seven nodes. However, the ran-
dom sampling solution based on predicted probability from Neural
Diving is infeasible. Unguided DDIM is unable to find a feasible
solution (there is an edge between node 7 and node 8). In contrast,
IP Guided DDIM is able to fetch the optimal solution by finding
an independent set containing eight nodes during the sampling
process, where no two nodes are connected. Notably, the qualityof the solution improves as the sampling process progresses. The
independent set contains 5 nodes at step 10, 7 nodes at step 50, and
finally 8 nodes (the optimal solution) at step 100. These indicate
that IP Guided DDIM outperforms Neural Diving and Unguided
DDIM in finding the optimal solution for this illustrative example.
5.2 Performance Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the performance of different methods by
comparing their average feasible ratios, gaps and average objective
values across four datasets mentioned earlier. Each dataset contains
100 instances. For each instance, we sample 30 solutions and cal-
culate the corresponding metrics, which allows us to assess the
performance of each method in terms of both solution feasibility
and objective value across the different datasets.
We first compare the feasibility ratio of the complete solutions
generated by IP Guided Diffusion with the partial solutions gen-
erated by Neural Diving, due to the inability of Neural Diving to
produce complete solutions. In Neural Diving, the expected pro-
portion of variables assigned by the model is controlled by the
hyper-parameter "Coverage" 𝐶. A higher𝐶results in more vari-
ables being assigned by the model, which generally leads to a lower
feasibility ratio. Therefore, a carefully prescribed coverage 𝐶is cru-
cial in Neural Diving to ensure the feasibility of partial solutions.
In this experiment, we trained two variants of Neural Diving with
different coverage thresholds for each dataset. For the SC, CA, and
IS datasets, the coverage are set to 0.2 (low coverage) and 0.3 (high
coverage) respectively. However, for the CF dataset, the coverage

we measure the feasible ratio of complete solutions. Two versions of Neural Diving are trained with distinct coverage thresholds,

Neural Diving, as the complete solutions from this method yield a 0% feasibility ratio.

thresholds are set to 0.1 and 0.2. Figure 4 presents the average feasi-
ble ratio for 100 instances. In this comparison, the feasible ratio of
complete solutions from IP guided DDIM outperforms the solutions
of Neural Diving in almost all instances.
To more comprehensively evaluate the performance of the dif-
fusion model, we compare it against different baselines in Table 1.
For SCIP, we adopt the first solution obtained through non-trivial
heuristic algorithms during the solving phase. For Gurobi, we use
the best heuristic solution for each instance as a benchmark. Addi-
tionally, we include the optimal objective values (obtained through
running Gurobi for 100 seconds on each instance) as ground-truth.
For Neural Diving, complete solutions are frequently infeasible. As
such, we employ a low-coverage model that prioritizes the feasi-
bility of partial solutions. Subsequently, a CompleteSol heuristic isutilized to finalize these partial solutions. In the case of the Predict
and Search algorithm (PS), we construct a trust region using partial
solutions with the same proportion of assigned variables as Neural
Diving and use Gurobi as the Solver to search the best heuristic
solutions found as a benchmark. To ensure a fair comparison, we
report not only the quality of the complete solutions generated by
our methods (IP Guided DDIM/DDPM), but also the quality of par-
tial solutions. For this, we randomly select the same proportion of
variables from DDIM’s complete solutions as the ratio from Neural
Diving and PS as our partial solutions. We then use the CompleteSol
heuristic to finalize these partial solutions.
The results are presented in Table 1. It is evident that the com-
plete solutions produced using the IP Guided DDIM method have a

complete solutions obtained solely through Neural Diving are con-

from IP Guided DDIM with the CompleteSol heuristic outstrips
that of all methods in terms of objective values. This improvement
is demonstrated by a 3.7 to 33.7% reduction in the gap to optimal
values, while the feasibility ratio for all datasets approaches 100%.
5.3 Ablation Study
We ablate on unguided DDIM (with 𝑠=0), constraint guided DDIM
(with𝛾=1), objective guided DDIM (with 𝛾=0) models and
IP guided DDIM on four datasets. We also include an experiment
where we train IP and solution embeddings directly via algorithm
1 without CISP, in order to assess the advantages of contrastive
learning, i.e. IP Guided DDIP w/o CISP in Table 2. The results are
presented in Table 2. Evidently, the constraint guidance is crucial
in generating feasible solutions, and the objective guidance fur-
ther enhances the quality of solutions. Moreover, the experiments
demonstrate that CISP plays a crucial role in ensuring that the
solutions produced by our methods are more feasible. Therefore,
combining both constraint and objective guidance achieves good
quality solutions with high probability.
5.4 Scalability test and qualitative analysis
Practitioners often aim to apply the models learned to solve prob-
lems of larger scales than the ones used for data collection and
training. To estimate how well a model can generalize to bigger
instances, we evaluate its performance on datasets of varying sizes
from the Set Cover problem (minimization problem). We utilize
three size categories:
•SC (2000): 2000 variables, 1000 constraints
•SC (3000): 3000 variables, 1500 constraints
•SC (4000): 4000 variables, 2000 constraints
It is worth noting that all models were trained using the SC (2000)
dataset. The results in table 3 demonstrate that IP guided DDPM
consistently performs well across all three different-sized datasets,
indicating that our framework possesses strong generalization ca-
pabilities.

Diffusion models are generative models that capture the distri-

of solutions generated by our methods. We take a single instance
from the SC dataset and IS dataset and use the IP Guided DDIM
algorithm to generate 1000 complete feasible solutions. We also
randomly sample 20% of variable values from each solution and

use the CompleteSol heuristic to fill in the remaining variables.
We analyze the distribution of objective values for these complete
solutions and compare them with the optimal objective values and
the best heuristic solutions found by the Gurobi heuristic. The re-
sults are shown in Figure 5. Clearly, the complete solutions directly
generated by the IP Guided DDIM algorithm are superior to the
best solutions from the Gurobi heuristic. Furthermore, the objective
values from the partial solutions completed by the CompleteSol
heuristic are closer to the optimal value.
6 Related Work
We start the related work section with a summary of deep learning
techniques used in the construction of feasible solutions for Inte-
ger Programming (IP) problems. Gasse et al . [5] propose a method
that combines a bipartite graph with a Graph Convolutional Net-
work (GCN) to extract representations of Integer Programming
(IP) instances. Although this approach is primarily employed to
learn the branching policy in the branch and bound algorithm, it
is worth noting that this modeling method can also be utilized for
the prediction of solutions for IP instances. However, the solutions
produced by GCN directly are often infeasible or sub-optimal. To
address this, Neural Diving [ 21] leverages the SelectiveNet [ 6] to
assign values to only a subset of the variables based on a coverage
threshold, with the rest of the variables being completed via an IP
Solver. To further improve the feasibility of generated solutions,
Han et al . [8] proposes a predict-search framework that combines
the predictions from GNN model with trust region method. How-
ever, this method still relies on IP solver to solve a modified instance
(adding neighborhood constraints to origin instance) in order to
get complete solutions. Similar to Nair et al . [21] , Khalil et al . [14]
integrate GNN into integer programming solvers and apply it to
construct a partial solutions through a prescribed rounding thresh-
old, which is then completed using SCIP. In contrast, our method
aims to learn the latent structure of IP instances by diffusion models,
and obtains complete feasible solutions through guided diffusion
sampling, without any reliance on the IP solver.
Another set of related works to our paper is diffusion mod-
els [9,32]. As the latest state-of-the-art family of deep generative
models, diffusion models have demonstrated their ability to en-
hance performance across various generative tasks [ 37]. In this
paper, we focus our discussion specifically on conditional diffusion
models. Unlike unconditional generation, conditional generation
emphasizes application-level contents as a condition to control the
generated results based on predefined intentions. To enable this
conditioning, Dhariwal and Nichol [4]introduce the concept of clas-
sifier guidance, which enhances sample quality by conditioning the
generative process on an additional trained classifier. In the same
vein, Ho and Salimans [10]propose a joint training strategy for both
conditional and unconditional diffusion models, i.e., classifier-free
guidance. This approach combines the resulting conditional and un-
conditional scores to achieve a balance between sample quality and
diversity. This idea has also found its effectiveness in Topology Op-
timization [ 20]. We thus take a similar derivation from the classifier
guidance and devise IP-guided diffusion sampling by incorporating
the objectives and constraints into the transition probability.7 Discussions
7.1 The Importance of Solution Generation
Integer Programming solvers typically rely on branch-and-bound or
branch-and-cut algorithms to tackle problems, often starting with
a primal heuristic to find a good initial feasible solution. A robust
starting solution generally accelerates the entire solving process.
Our method demonstrates that diffusion models are capable of gen-
erating complete feasible solutions that satisfy all constraints. These
generated solutions exhibit competitive performance compared
to the heuristics employed in optimization tools such as Gurobi.
Notably, the ability to generate complete solutions from scratch
distinguishes our model from other neural-based approaches like
Neural Diving [ 21] and the Predict-Search algorithm [ 8]. Moreover,
generating feasible solutions end-to-end is especially important, as
it represents a significant leap toward developing a purely neural-
based method for integer programming. The paper shows that
diffusion models can produce solutions that satisfy all constraints,
which lays the foundation for future research in which neural net-
works could potentially solve such problems without relying on
traditional solvers or heuristics.
7.2 Sampling Efficiency
The sampling time is a notable limitation of current diffusion models.
Specifically, our method requires 100 iterative denoising steps for
DDIM and 1000 for DDPM, resulting in longer times to generate a
single solution compared to other methods. To address this issue,
there have been active studies focused on accelerating diffusion
sampling, such as model quantization (Li et al . [17] ) and distillation
(HUANG et al . [11] ). These techniques can be readily integrated
into our methods. Moving forward, we will enhance our method
by incorporating these acceleration techniques.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a comprehensive framework for gen-
erating feasible solutions for Integer Programming (IP) problems.
We utilized the CISP approach to establish a link between IP in-
stances and their corresponding solutions, allowing to obtain IP
embeddings and solution embeddings. To effectively capture the
distribution of feasible solutions, we leveraged diffusion models,
which are known for their powerful learning capabilities, to learn
the distribution of solution embeddings. We further employed a so-
lution decoder to reconstruct the solutions from their embeddings.
Importantly, we proposed an IP guided sampling algorithm that
explicitly incorporates the objective and constraint information to
generate high-quality solutions. The experimental results on four
distinct datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach to
the state-of-the-art.

A Appendix
A.1 CISP Algorithm
The study conducted by [ 27] underscores the substantial efficacy
of contrasting pre-training in capturing multi-modal data, with
particular emphasis on its application in the text-to-image transfer
domain. Drawing inspiration from this seminal work, we introduce
the CISP algorithm. The primary objective of CISP is to facilitate
the learning of the IP Encoder E𝐼and the Solution Encoder EX, as
illustrated in Algorithm 4. Within the scope of our investigation,
we work with a mini-batch of data comprising instances denoted
as𝐼and their corresponding solutions denoted as X. The batch’s
bipartite graph representing instances 𝐼is denoted as G. We use
z𝐼andzXto denote the embeddings of instances and solutions,
respectively. Notably, both z𝐼andzXpossess identical dimensions,
enabling us to compute their cosine similarity. Furthermore, within
the mini-batch,z 𝐼,𝑗andzX,𝑘denote to the 𝑗th sample in z𝐼and
the𝑘th sample in zX, respectively. Within this conceptual frame-
work, we leverage the matrix s∈R𝑁×𝑁to represent the similarity
between𝑁instances and 𝑁solutions. Each element s𝑗,𝑘, where
𝑗,𝑘∈{1,...,𝑁}, corresponds to the logit employed in computation
of the symmetric cross-entropy loss.

A.3 Datasets and Baselines
A.3.1 Datasets. For all four datasets, we randomly generate 1000
instances (800 for training, 100 for validation and 100 for testing).
Table 5 summarizes the numbers of constraints, variables and prob-
lem type of each dataset. We then collect feasible solutions and
their objective values for each instance by running the Gurobi [7]
or SCIP [ 3], where the time limit is set to 1000s for each instance.
For those instances with a large number of feasible solutions, we
only keep 500 best solutions. We adopt the same features exacted
via the Ecole library as in [ 5] and exclude those related to feasible
solutions. The specific features are shown in Appendix A.2.
A.3.2 Baselines. We compared our method with the following
baselines:•SCIP [3] (an open source solver): SCIP is currently one of
the fastest non-commercial solvers for mixed integer pro-
gramming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming
(MINLP). Here, we focus on comparing the quality of initial
solutions with SCIP. Instead of relying on the first feasible
solution generated by SCIP, which are often of low quality
due to the use of trivial heuristics, we employ the first so-
lution produced via non-trivial heuristic algorithms during
the solving process of SCIP [ 3] (i.e. the first feasible solution
after the pre-solving stage of SCIP).
•Gurobi [7] (the powerful commercial solver): Gurobi is a
highly efficient commercial mathematical optimization solver.
As our focus is on comparing feasible solutions, we consider
the best solutions obtained through Gurobi’s default heuris-
tic algorithms as a benchmark.
•Neural Diving (ND) [21]: Neural Diving adopts a solution pre-
diction approach, training a GCN to predict the value of each
variable. It then incorporates SelectiveNet [ 6] to generate
partial solutions with a predefined coverage threshold 𝐶(e.g.,
a coverage threshold 𝐶=0.2means that the expectation of
the number of assigned variables by the neural network is
20%). This threshold is typically set to be low ( <0.5) to en-
sure the feasibility of partial solutions. In our experiments,
to evaluate the feasibility of solutions, we set two different
coverage levels, namely low coverage (which usually indi-
cates higher feasibility) and high coverage (which usually
indicates lower feasibility), for each dataset. We then com-
pare the feasibility of the partial solutions with the complete
solutions generated by our methods. To assess the quality
of solutions, we employ the Completesol heuristic in SCIP
(Algorithm 4 in [ 19]) to enhance the partial solutions. This
heuristic involves solving auxiliary IP instances by fixing the
4117KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Hao Zeng et al.
variables from the partial solutions. By utilizing this heuris-
tic, we can obtain more complete solutions and evaluate their
quality.
•Predict-and-search algorithm (PS) [8]: The PS algorithm, sim-
ilar to Neural Diving, utilizes graph neural networks to pre-
dict the value of each variable. It then searches for the best
feasible solution within a trust region constructed by the
predicted partial solutions. This method requires setting pa-
rameters(𝑘0,𝑘1)to represent the numbers of 0’s and 1’s in
a partial solution, and Δto define the range of the neigh-
borhood region of the partial solution. To search a high-
quality feasible solution, this method adds neighborhood
constraints to origin instance, which produces modified IP
instance. Therefore, an IP solver such as SCIP or Gurobi is
required to solve the modified instance and obtain feasible
solutions. In our experiments, we use Gurobi as the solver
and control the parameters Δto ensure that the modified
instance is 100% feasible. We considered the best heuristic
solutions from the modified instance found by Gurobi as our
baseline.

A.4 Training Details
We trained the CISP and diffusion model on four IP datasets. Each
dataset contained 800 training instances, with 500 solutions col-
lected for each instance. In each batch, we sampled 64instances,
and for each instance, We sample one solution from 500 solutions
in proportion to the probability of the objective value as a possi-
ble label. This implies that solutions with better objective values
had a higher probability of being sampled. We iterated through all
instances (with one solution per instance) in each epoch.
For the Solution Encoder, we utilized a single transformer encode
layer with a width of 128. The IP encoder adopted the architecture
described in [ 21], using GCN to obtain embeddings for all vari-
ables as IP embeddings. Both models transformed the features of
the solution and IP into latent variables with a dimension of 128,
enabling convenient computation of cosine similarity in CISP. The
CISP was trained using the AdamW Optimizer [ 18]. We employed
a decreasing learning rate strategy, starting with a learning rate of
0.001 and linearly decaying it by a factor of 0.9 every 100 epochs
until reaching 800 epochs. The model training was performed with
a batch size of 64.
For the diffusion model, we utilized a single-layer Transformer
encoder with a width of 128 to predict zxand adjusted the number
of time steps to 1000. The forward process variances were set as
constants, increasing linearly from 𝛽1=10−4to𝛽𝑇=0.02, follow-
ing the default setting of DDPM [ 9]. The solution decoder modelwas jointly trained with the diffusion model and consisted of two
Transformer encode layers with a width of 128. The loss function
was defined as the sum of the diffusion loss, decoder loss, and the
penalty for violating constraints, as shown in (5). Here,𝜆is set
to be the number of variables in the instances from the training
set, excluding the IS dataset, where 𝜆=0. We trained diffusion
and decoder model for 100 epochs with batch size of 32via Adam
Optimizer [15].
A.5 Training and Inference Time
In this section, we report the training time (including CISP pretrain-
ing and Diffusion model) for each dataset, which takes 100 epochs
for both CISP and Diffusion model to converge. Additionally, we
provide the total inference time for sampling 3000 solutions by us-
ing IP Guided DDIM and DDPM. From Table 6, we observe that our
method requires a reasonable amount of time for model training.
During the inference phase, IP Guided DDIM demonstrates faster
performance compared to IP Guided DDPM with average time of
0.46s-1.68s for sampling each solution. Moreover, as shown in the
experiment results from Section 5, IP Guided DDIM also achieves
better performance than DDPM, making it suitable for practical
applications.
