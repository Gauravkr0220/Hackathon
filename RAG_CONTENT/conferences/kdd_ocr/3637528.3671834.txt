Abstract
Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often face a chal-
lenging trade-off, where prioritizing fairness may require compro-
mising utility. In this work, we re-examine fairness through the
lens of spectral graph theory, aiming to reconcile fairness and util-
ity within the framework of spectral graph learning. We explore
the correlation between sensitive features and spectrum in GNNs,
using theoretical analysis to delineate the similarity between origi-
nal sensitive features and those after convolution under different
spectra. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the impact of similar-
ity when the eigenvectors associated with the largest magnitude
eigenvalue exhibit directional similarity. Based on these theoreti-
cal insights, we propose FUGNN, a novel spectral graph learning
approach that harmonizes the conflict between fairness and utility.
FUGNN ensures algorithmic fairness and utility by truncating the
spectrum and optimizing eigenvector distribution during the en-
coding process. The fairness-aware eigenvector selection reduces
the impact of convolution on sensitive features while concurrently
minimizing the sacrifice of utility. FUGNN further optimizes the
distribution of eigenvectors through a transformer architecture.
By incorporating the optimized spectrum into the graph convo-
lution network, FUGNN effectively learns node representations.
Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior-
ity of FUGNN over baseline methods. The codes are available at

1 Introduction
With the prevalence of graph-structured data in real-world appli-
cations, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising
performance in high-stake domains [ 43,47], such as loan approval
[12], disaster response [ 48], criminal justice [ 19], and medical di-
agnoses [ 3]. In these applications, certain features (e.g., gender,
race, age, and region) are legally protected to prevent abuse and are
regarded as sensitive features [ 21]. However, GNNs may produce
biased predictions that discriminate against particular subgroups
characterized by these sensitive features [ 38]. For example, GNNs
may cause racial discrimination in underdiagnoses [ 11] or gender
discrimination in low-interest loans [ 29]. Hence, mitigating discrim-
ination induced by GNNs to achieve fairness remains as a critical
challenge in this domain.
Various efforts have been devoted to developing fairness-aware
GNNs, aiming to control the degree to which a model depends on
sensitive features, measured by independence criteria such as sta-
tistical parity and equality opportunity [ 40]. Different controlling
techniques have been proposed [ 30], including weighting pertur-
bation [ 27], embedding adjustment [ 31], pre-processing dataset
[1], and loss function regularization [ 15]. These methods aim to
promote the fairness but often come with a trade-off in utility, gen-
erally measured by predicting accuracy [ 16]. Figure 1 compares the

vanilla graph convolution network, a widely adopted graph neu-
ral architecture, and five fairness-aware GNNs in terms of utility
(accuracy) and fairness (independence on sensitive features, i.e.,
-ΔSP) on a real-world dataset (i.e., Pokec-z). Although these fairness-
aware GNNs reduce the dependence on sensitive features, utility is
generally compromised.

Figure 1: The sacrificed utility of fairness-aware GNNs. The
utility is measured by the prediction accuracy and the fair-
ness is measured by the - ΔSP.
In this paper, we study fairness in GNNs from a new perspective,
i.e., spectral theory, inspired by recent work on the expressive spec-
tral filters and spectrum analysis of the underlying graph matrix
(e.g., adjacency or Laplacian matrix and their normalized forms)
[5]. We ask the question: is it possible to harmonize the conflict be-
tween utility and fairness through graph spectral analysis? The key
to a fairness-aware spectral filter lies in revealing the relationship
between the fairness of a model and the graph spectrum. Therefore,
our first step is to perform theoretical analysis to quantify the extent
of a model’s protection over sensitive features, via comparing the
similarity between the original representations of sensitive features
at the input layer and their deep representations after convolution
using spectral theory.
Our theoretical analysis reveal two findings: (1) The similarity
between original sensitive features and their deep representations
after convolution is best captured by the eigenvector corresponding
to the largest eigenvalue. This motivates us to select principal eigen-
values as the spectrum for convolution, through which fairness in
prediction results can be maintained. This also ensures that model
utility can be preserved since spectral graph theory indicates that
the largest non-zero eigenvalues are linked to the geometry of the
graph (including algebraic connectivity and spectral radius) [ 35]; (2)
the impact of non-principal eigenvectors on the fairness of a model
diminishes exponentially with an increase in the number of convo-
lutional layers. This motivates us to remove these components to
guide the model to focus on those principal eigenvectors.
Based on the theoretical analysis, we present a novel approach,
FUGNN (harmonizing Fairness and Utility GNN), which promotes
fairness in graph learning at minimal cost to utility via spectrum
modification. Our spectrum modification strategy is designed based
on our two findings above, that is, harmonizing utility and fairness
through selecting the spectral component that has the highest im-
pact on utility and fairness. Specifically, FUGNN first computes 𝐾
largest magnitude eigenvalues along with corresponding eigenvec-
tors from the adjacency matrix. This subset of eigenvalues expresses
convolution corresponding to sensitive features while mitigating
the influence of non-principle eigenvectors. Then, FUGNN employsa transformer architecture to optimize the distribution of eigen-
vectors, ensuring the independence of sensitive features during
convolution. Finally, our method incorporates the optimized spec-
trum in graph convolution, and obtains fair node representations.
In summary, our contributions are outlined below:
•A synergistic approach to fairness and utility. We present
FUGNN, a spectral graph learning method that harmonizes
the conflict between fairness and utility in fairness-aware
GNNs. FUGNN strategically mitigates the convolution im-
pact on sensitive features while achieving high utility.
•Theoretical insights into sensitive feature expression.
We study the model fairness preservation from a spectral per-
spective through rigorous theoretical analysis. Our findings
provide insights about the correlation between the graph
spectrum and the deep representations of sensitive features
within a graph model, forming the foundation of the pro-
posed FUGNN.
•A novel eigenvalue selection mechanism for preserv-
ing model fairness. Building on our theoretical findings,
we introduce an innovative eigenvalue selection mechanism
that can truncate the spectrum to ensure fairness without
compromising utility, providing a nuanced approach to miti-
gating fairness challenges within GNNs.
•Empirical validation through extensive evaluations. To
verify the effectiveness of the proposed FUGNN approach,
we conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations on six real-
world datasets. The results demonstrate the superior per-
formance of FUGNN in achieving both fairness and utility
when compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNNs.

2.1 Spectral GNNs
Spectral GNNs process features through filters, including well-
known models like GCN [ 33], SGC [ 46], and S2GC [ 51], which rely
on eigenvectors of the (normalized) Laplacian for Graph Fourier
Transform. Polynomials are employed to approximate the spec-
tral graph convolution, and are optimized to enhance the utility
of GNNs. JacobiConv [ 44] uses the concept of an orthogonal ba-
sis, aligning its weight function with the graph signal density in
the spectrum, and improves GNN utility through a novel poly-
nomial coefficient decomposition technique. ChebNetII [ 24] is a
novel GNN model that utilizes Chebyshev interpolation, focus-
ing on the Chebyshev polynomials to achieve superior utility. In
terms of node features, it is incorporated into several spectral graph
learning. CSBM-G [ 45] imposes a Gaussian assumption on node
features to better capture nonlinear relations in graph-structured
data, which is significant when node features are more information
than the graph structure. FE-GNN [ 41] conducts a comprehensive
examination of the dominant feature space in representation learn-
ing based on spectral model, optimizing GNN utility through the
perspective of the dominant feature space. In conventional GNN
architectures, the interdependence between different channels of
the filter can impede the utility of more potent filters. To address
this, PDF [ 49] introduces a novel normalized adjacency matrix util-
ity capable of leveraging an expanded set of bases and learnable
filter coefficients, thereby enhancing responsiveness to the filter.

Specformer [ 6] further extends this methodology by broadening
its applicability to point-level tasks. However, these spectral fil-
ters do not explicitly consider algorithmic fairness. They disregard
the interdependence between sensitive features and other features,
potentially introducing bias into the filter.
2.2 Fairness-aware GNNs
The fairness of GNNs has gained substantial traction, primarily
focusing on examination of discrimination associated with spe-
cific sensitive features. Predominant fairness-aware GNNs revolve
around protecting the independence of sensitive features using pre-
processing and in-processing methods [ 9]. Some previous methods
improve fairness by pre-processing the dataset [ 22,37]. For instance,
Graphair [ 37] autonomously identifies fairness-aware augmenta-
tions from input graph data, aiming to circumventing sensitive fea-
tures while preserving the integrity of other valuable data. FairAC
[22] shows a fair feature completion approach to address infor-
mation gaps and acquire equitable node embeddings for graphs
lacking features. As an integral component of GNNs aimed at con-
verting networks into low-dimensional vectors, fair embeddings as
pre-processing methods play a crucial role in protecting sensitive
features [ 26]. DeBayes [ 7] decreases bias in the embeddings by
introducing biased information into the prior of the conditional
network embedding. To mitigate bias in node embeddings, Fair-
Sample [ 13] enhances fairness through a regularization objective.
Some in-processing methods use loss functions to constrain the
influence of algorithms on sensitive features [ 14,15]. EDITS [ 15]
devises a loss function targeting the node output aimed to mitigate
biases within the input feature network, fostering fairer GNN out-
comes. FairGNN [ 14] is designed to limit the influence of sensitive
features using an estimation function and adversarial debiasing loss
function. However, these algorithms often enhance fairness at the
expense of the utility of algorithms.
3 Preliminaries
3.1 Notations
Unless otherwise specified, we denote sets with copperplate upper-
case letters (i.e.,A), matrices with bold uppercase letters (i.e., A),
and vectors with bold lowercase letters (i.e., a).
We denote an undirected graph as G=(V,X), whereVis the
set of𝑛nodes in the graph, X∈R𝑛×𝑑is the node feature matrix,
and𝑑is the feature dimension. For the 𝑙-th graph convolution layer,
denoting its output node utility as H(𝑙), we generalize spectral
graph convolution as follows [10, 34]:
H(𝑙)=(1−𝜃)SH(𝑙−1)+𝜃H(0), (1)
where𝜃∈ (0,1),H(0)=𝑓Θ(X), and Sis the adjacency matrix.
ℎ∈R1×𝑛is one channel in the filter that corresponds to one
dimension of H(0).
In particular, we denote the sensitive feature channel as ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛.
Based on the generalized formulation in Equation (1), we conduct
fairness analysis on existing graph convolutions from the perspec-
tive of the graph’s spectrum. Assume S∈R𝑛×𝑛is a symmetric
matrix with real-valued entries. |𝜆1|≥|𝜆2|≥......≥|𝜆𝑛|are𝑛real
eigenvalues, and p𝑖(𝑖∈{1,2,......,𝑛}) are the corresponding eigen-
vectors. After one layer of convolution, ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛is represented as Sℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛.
After𝑙layers convolution, it is represented as S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛. The cosinesimilarity between S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛andℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛, denoted as 𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛⟩),
reflects the similarity between original sensitive features and the
sensitive features after 𝑙layers of convolution. A higher cosine
similarity indicates stronger protection of sensitive feature inde-
pendence, reflecting higher fairness in GNNs. Furthermore, we
measure the eigenvector’s influence on the sensitive features byÍ𝐾
𝑖=1𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,p𝑖⟩), where𝐾is the number of selection eigenvec-
tors.
3.2 Fairness Evaluation Metrics
In this subsection, we present two definitions of fairness for the
binary label 𝑦∈{0,1}and sensitive features 𝑠∈{0,1}. We use
ˆ𝑦∈{0,1}to represent the predicted class label.
Definition 1. Statistical Parity (i.e., Demographic Parity, Indepen-
dence) [18]. Statistical parity requires the predictions to be indepen-
dent of the sensitive features 𝑠. It can be formally written as:
P(ˆ𝑦|𝑠=0)=P(ˆ𝑦|𝑠=1). (2)
When both the predicted labels and sensitive features are binary,
the extent of statistical parity can be quantified by ΔSP, defined as
follows:
Δ𝑆𝑃=|P(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑠=0)−P(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑠=1)|. (3)
TheΔSPmeasures the acceptance rate difference between the
two sensitive subgroups.
Definition 2. Equal Opportunity [23]. Equal opportunity necessi-
tates that the likelihood of an instance belonging to a positive class
leading to a positive outcome should be equitable for all members
within subgroups. For individuals with positive ground truth labels,
it is necessary for positive predictions to be devoid of any depen-
dence on sensitive features. This principle can be mathematically
expressed as follows:
P(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑦=1,𝑠=0)=P(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑦=1,𝑠=1). (4)
Fairness-aware GNNs prevent the allocation of unfavorable pre-
dictions to individuals who are eligible for advantageous ones solely
based on their sensitive subgroup affiliation. In particular, ΔEOquan-
tifies the extent of deviation in predictions from the ideal scenario
where equality of opportunity is satisfied. To quantitatively assess
euqal opportunity, we employ the following metric:
Δ𝐸𝑂=|P(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑦=1,𝑠=0)−P(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑦=1,𝑠=1)|. (5)
Both probabilities are evaluated on the test set.
4 FUGNN: Theoretical Discovery
In this section, we present our theoretical findings that underpin
FUGNN. We analyze the correlation between sensitive features and
the graph spectrum. The independence of a model on sensitive fea-
tures can be reflected by the cosine similarity between S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛and
ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛, where a higher cosine similarity indicates stronger protection
of sensitive feature independence. Hence, we analyze the relation-
ship between the graph spectrum and the term 𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛⟩).
We aim to identify the components from the entire graph spec-
trum that have the most significant impact on the fairness of a
model. We consider three different spectral components: (1) a single
eigenvector with the largest magnitude of eigenvalue; (2) multi-
ples eigenvectors with the (same) largest magnitude of eigenvalue;
and (3) non-principal eigenvectors (i.e., eigenvectors with small
eigenvalues).

□
The above theorem shows that the term 𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛⟩)is
well captured by the spectral component p1. This indicates that
the principal component carries the most information about the
fairness of a model.4.2 Multiple Eigenvectors Corresponding to the
Largest Magnitude Eigenvalue
The matrix Scan possess multiple eigenvectors associated with the
largest magnitude eigenvalue, and thus, Lemma 1 does not hold.
Next, we investigate such cases.
Lemma 2. Assume that there are multiple eigenvectors corre-
sponding to the largest magnitude eigenvalue in the real-valued
entries. The eigenvalues are ordered as |𝜆1|=|𝜆2|=......=|𝜆𝑗|>
|𝜆𝑗+1|≥......≥|𝜆𝑛|, and p𝑖∈R𝑛,𝑖∈{1,2,......,𝑛}are correspond-
ing eigenvectors. Then the following equation holds:

Then, considering 𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,p𝑖⟩)=𝛼𝑖√︃Í𝑛

𝑖=1𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,p𝑖⟩).
Especially, only if right-side terms 𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,p𝑖⟩)are equal, the
equation holds.
□
Lemma 2 shows that the term 𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛⟩)is determined
by multiple principal components. The lower bound of the term
𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛⟩)is a weighted sum of the multiple eigenvectors
corresponding to the largest magnitude eigenvalue. In particular,
the similarity is maximum when the directions of these eigenvectors
are similar.
4.3 Non-principal Eigenvectors
For an eigenvector of S, if the corresponding eigenvalue |𝜆𝑖|<<|𝜆1|,
the eigenvector is regarded as non-principal eigenvector.

optimization with fairness considerations. The top and bottom illustrate the two stages from the perspective of feature-level
representations and feature channels, respectively.
Lemma 3. The influence of non-principal eigenvectors on sensi-
tive features decays exponentially.
Proof. Because

Hence, the correlation between p𝑖and𝑐𝑜𝑠(⟨S𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛,ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛⟩)is pro-
portional to(𝜆𝑖
𝜆1)𝑙. Because of|𝜆1|>>|𝜆𝑖|, the correlation decays
exponentially. It’s even negligible with fewer layers.
□
The above analysis proves that impact of non-principal eigen-
vectors on the deep representations of sensitive features (i.e., after
convolution) diminishes exponentially.
In conclusion, sensitive features, after 𝑙layers of convolution,
are predominantly influenced by the eigenvector corresponding
to the largest magnitude eigenvalue (or multiple eigenvectors cor-
responding to the largest magnitude eigenvalue). Fortunately, as
shown in previous studies, these principal eigenvectors are also
most influential in the utility of a model [ 35]. Thus, we argue that
truncating the spectrum to include only principal eigenvectors can
enhance the fairness of a model without compromising utility.
5 FUGNN: Technical Details
In this section, we introduce the design details of FUGNN. Our ap-
proach involves three main components: fairness-aware eigenvalue
selection, optimization of eigenvector distribution, and graph con-
volution. Firstly, we compute the 𝐾largest magnitude eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenvectors. These principal eigenvec-
tors are retained as they are shown to be effective in expressing
the structure of the graph and in preserving sensitive features, as
demonstrated by our theoretical analysis [ 35]. Secondly, we un-
dertake adjustments in the distribution of eigenvectors with the
transformer architecture, which further harmonizes and improves
the utility and fairness of the model. Lastly, we assign the optimiz-
ing spectrum into graph convolution. Figure 2 illustrates the model
architecture.5.1 Fairness-aware Eigenvalue Selection (FES)
In Section 4, we have shown that sensitive features, after 𝑙layers
convolution, primarily correlate with the largest magnitude eigen-
value and their corresponding eigenvectors. Hence, keeping these
eigenvectors in the graph spectrum can promote the fairness of the
model. Meanwhile, according to Lemma 2 andLemma3, the impact
of a non-principal eigenvector on the model fairness is negligible
after𝑙layer of convolution. We hypothesize that removing these
non-principal eigenvectors can better guide the model to focus on
the principal eigenvectors.
Thus, we propose to modify the graph spectrum by selecting
those eigenvectors. We leverage the Arnoldi Package algorithm [ 36]
to obtain the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix by computing a
subset of𝐾eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors:
e𝐹𝐸𝑆=(𝜆1,𝜆2,......,𝜆𝐾),
P𝐹𝐸𝑆=(p1,p2,......, pK).(8)
We choose Arnoldi Package due to its high computational efficiency
and its accuracy as empirically demonstrated in [8].
Here,𝐾is a model hyperparameter representing the number of
principal eigenvectors that are kept in the graph spectrum. In our
empirical analysis in Section 6.5, we show that the effectiveness
of a model (i.e., fairness and utility) is influenced by the value 𝐾.
At lower range of 𝐾values (e.g., <10), a model maintains high
effectiveness with only slight fluctuations. However, when too
many non-principle eigenvectors are kept in the spectrum (e.g.,
𝐾>100), the effectiveness of a model will decrease significantly.
5.2 Optimization of Eigenvectors Distribution
(OED)
ByLemma 2, the maximum similarity between ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛andS𝑙ℎ𝑠𝑒𝑛is
intrinsically tied to the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue. That is, the model fairness is best preserved when the
variation in the distribution of eigenvectors is minimal. Thus, to de-
crease the influence of convolutional layers on sensitive features, we
optimize the eigenvalue distribution using Transformer. Although
the Transformer architecture has demonstrated effectiveness in
achieving high model utility [ 50], the purpose of introducing this
module to our proposed approach is different. We hope to achieve
high model utility, but more importantly, to optimize the eigenvec-
tor distribution for the purpose of preserving fairness.
 
2076KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Renqiang Luo et al.
More specifically, we encode the eigenvalues 𝜆2𝑖∈e𝐹𝐸𝑆and
𝜆2𝑖+1∈e𝐹𝐸𝑆as follows:
𝜌(𝜆2𝑖)=𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜆2𝑖/100002𝑖/𝑑),
𝜌(𝜆2𝑖+1)=𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜆2𝑖+1/100002𝑖/𝑑).(9)
We denote e𝑃𝑂𝑆=(𝜌(𝜆1),𝜌(𝜆2),......,𝜌(𝜆𝐾)). Then, the method
uses multi-head self-attention (MHA) with layer normalization (LN).
This modification facilitates the encoding of eigenvalues, enabling
the capture of their inter-dependencies and generating valuable util-
ity. This eigenvalue encoding serves to alter the similarity between
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue and other
eigenvectors, thereby effectively enhancing the utility of sensitive
features. The formal characterization of the eigenvalue adjustment
is provided as follows:
e𝑀𝐻𝐴 =MHA(LN(e𝑃𝑂𝑆))+e𝑃𝑂𝑆. (10)
e𝑂𝐸𝐷=FFN(LN(e𝑀𝐻𝐴))+e𝑀𝐻𝐴. (11)
5.3 Graph Convolution
Finally, we assign optimizing spectrum based on learned basis e𝑂𝐸𝐷,
and transform H(𝑙−1)into:
H′(𝑙−1)=P𝐹𝐸𝑆·(𝑒𝑂𝐸𝐷⊙P⊤
𝐹𝐸𝑆H(𝑙−1)). (12)
The graph convolution can be written as follows:
H(𝑙)=𝜎((H(𝑙−1)||H′(𝑙−1))W(𝑙−1)), (13)
where W(𝑙−1)is the transformation, and 𝜎is the activation function.
By stacking multiple graph convolutional layers, FUGNN could
learn node representation.
6 Experiments
6.1 Datasets
We show the effectiveness of our method on the node classification,
and adopt six real-world datasets for this task:
•Income: Extracted from the Adult Data Set [ 4]. Each node
represents an individual, with connections established based
on criteria similar to [ 2]. The sensitive feature in this dataset
is race, and the task involves classifying whether an individ-
ual’s salary exceeds 50,000annually.
•Pokec-z andPokec-n: Both datasets are collected from
Pokec, a popular social network in Slovakia [ 42]. In both
datasets, users are represented as nodes, edges denoting
friendship. The locating region of users is the sensitive fea-
ture. The task is to classify users’ working fields.
•Bail: This dataset represents defendants who were released
on bail at the U.S. state courts during 1990-2009 [ 28]. Nodes
represent clients within a bail bank, features are gender, loan
amount, and other account-related details. Edges connect
clients whose credit accounts share similarities. The objec-
tive is to categorize clients’ credit risk as either high or low,
with “gender” designated as the sensitive feature.
•German: Extracted from the Adult Data Set [ 4]. Nodes rep-
resent defendants released in Germany from 1990 to 2009,
connected by edges based on shared past criminal recordsand demographics. The goal is predicting a defendant’s like-
lihood of committing either a violent or nonviolent crime
post-release, with “race” as the sensitive feature.
•Credit: Extracted from the Adult Data Set [ 4]. Comprising
individuals connected based on similarities in spending and
payment patterns. Age serves as the sensitive feature, while
the label feature denotes defaulting on credit card payments.
The statistics of these six datasets are shown in Table 2. For datasets
containing more than two classes of ground truth labels for the
node classification task, we retain the class labeled 0and1, and set
any class of labeled more than 1to1. We randomly select 25% of
nodes as the validation set and 25% as the test set, ensuring that
the proportion of nodes labeled with each category is balanced in
these sets. Additionally, we randomly select either 50% of nodes
or500nodes in each class of ground truth labels as the training
set, depending on which is a smaller. This partitioning strategy is
consistent with prior studies [ 2,15,17], which also serves as our
baselines.

6.2 Baselines
We compare our proposed method with three spectral convolutional
network methods: GCN [33],GCNII [10], and APPNP [34], as well
as the following representative and state-of-the-art fairness-aware
GNNs methods:
•NIFTY [2] seeks to optimize the alignment between predic-
tions derived from perturbed sensitive features and those
generated using unperturbed features.
•EDITS [15] preprocesses input graph data by feature and
structural debiasing methods to mitigate bias.
•FairGNN [14] utilizes adversarial training to eliminate sen-
sitive feature information from node embeddings.
•Graphair [37] focuses on acquiring equitable utility through
automated graph data augmentations.
•BIND [17] effectively estimates the impact of each training
node on the disparity in probabilistic distributions.
The optimal hyperparameters for all methods are obtained by
grid search. We employ the released implementations of fairness-
aware GNN baselines, namely FairGNN, NIFTY, EDITS, BIND, and
Graphair, to ensure a fair and consistent comparison. All baselines
are implemented using the PyTorch framework [ 39]. Specifically,
FairGNN, NIFTY, BIND and Graphair are optimized with Adam opti-
mizer [ 32], while EDITS utilizes RMSprop [ 25] as recommended. For
each method, we conduct experiments with different seeds {0, 1,2,3,
4} and use the mean value and standardized covariance as the results.
All models are implemented using PyTorch and PyTorch-geometric
[20], executed on the Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS operation system, with
hardware specifications including an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4114
CPU @ 2.20GHz and a Tesla V100S-PCIE-32G GPU.

6.3 Comparison Results
For assessing utility, we adopt node classification accuracy as the
corresponding metric, while for assessing fairness, we adopt two
traditional metrics ΔSPandΔEO. Higher accuracy indicates better
utility, and lower values of fairness metrics indicate better fairness.
6.3.1 Fairness. Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the
fairness evaluation metrics for our proposed FUGNN method and
various baseline models across six real-world datasets. FUGNN
consistently demonstrates outstanding fairness utility, particularly
notable in terms of ΔSPandΔEOacross the evaluated datasets. An
exception is observed in the ΔSPfor the Bail dataset, which showspoor performance. This can be partly attributed to excessive ac-
curacy of the model. However, the lower ΔEOindicates that the
algorithm ensures fairness in predicting the correct samples, reaf-
firming its effectiveness in addressing fairness-related concerns
within graph-based learning algorithms.
6.3.2 Trade-off between accuracy and fairness. To confirm our pur-
suit of a comprehensive assessment in accuracy and fairness, we
aim to achieve the best fairness with the highest accuracy. From Ta-
ble 1, we observe that our proposed FUGNN improves both fairness
and utility simultaneously. The utility achieved is even higher than
the three spectral graph convolution network methods. To provide
a more visual representation of our effectiveness, we present the

details in Figure 3 and Figure 4. For the fairness evaluation, we
employ the ΔSPandΔEOmetrics, respectively. Notably, the upper-
left corner point within these graphical utilities symbolizes the
optimal utility, characterized by the highest accuracy and the high-
est prediction fairness. This achievement aligns with the primary
objective of our approach, which aims to concurrently enhance
both the fairness and utility of GNNs.
6.4 Ablation Study
FUGNN, as an approach to harmonize the fairness and utility
in GNNs, achieves its objectives through two key components:
FUGNN FESandFUGNN OED. To comprehensively assess the contri-
butions of these two elements and the overall impact of FUGNN, we
conduct an ablation study. This study aims to discern whether both
FUGNN FESandFUGNN OED contribute to enhancing prediction
fairness and accuracy. In this part, we systematically remove each
component independently to assess their individual impacts.
We first focus on the contribution of eigenvalue calculation,
represented as FUGNN w/o FES (FUGNN without FUGNN FES).
Notably, when comparing FUGNN FESwith FUGNN, the latter con-
sistently outperforms them in terms of statistical parity, equal op-
portunity, and accuracy. The results, shown in Table 3, reinforce
the necessity of FUGNN FESwithin FUGNN. We then denote the
configuration without optimization of eigenvector distribution as
FUGNN w/o OED (FUGNN without FUGNN OED). The results, as
presented in Table 3, provide compelling evidence of the contribu-
tions of this component. When comparing FUGNN to the ablated
versions, FUGNN is consistently higher in terms of accuracy and
lower in terms of ΔSPandΔEO. This observation underscores that
FUGNN OED plays a crucial role in enhancing both the fairness of
GNN predictions and accuracy.
In summary, the ablation study collectively emphasizes the in-
tegral role played by FUGNN FESand FUGNN OED in improving
fairness and utility in GNNs.
6.5 Parameter Analysis
In this investigation, our primary aim is to scrutinize the impact of
parameter𝐾on our proposed FUGNN. Specifically, we conduct a
systematic parameter study that focuses on the variable denoted as
𝐾across the six datasets. The parameter 𝐾assumes a pivotal roleas it governs how original information from the adjacency matrix
is retained. Moreover, it also plays a crucial role in representing
the similarity between original sensitive features and ones after 𝑙
layers of convolution. According to our theoretical analysis, as 𝐾
increases, fairness initially hovers, followed by a subsequent decline.
The following experiment results verify our analysis.
Our analysis involves exploring 𝐾values spanning the range
of 1-10, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 𝑛. To show how 𝐾affects ΔSP
andΔEO, we present the average results for multiple runs. The
outcomes of Income andCredit are shown in Table 4. Additional
results of the parameter analysis are shown in Table 5 and Table 6.
Given that the number of nodes in the German dataset is 1,000,
far below 5,000, there is no 𝐾=5,000result available for the
German dataset, and the 𝐾=1,000result is congruent with the
𝐾=𝑛result. Additionally, we conduct eigedecomposition on the
adjacency matrices of Pokec-z andPokec-n, resulting in processed
eigenvalue and eigenvector files of approximately 18 GB in size.
When we applied these files for model training, we encountered
Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors. The findings indicate that as 𝐾
varies in{1,2,...,10}, bothΔSPandΔEOexhibit relatively consistent
performance with moderate fluctuations. When 𝐾reaches >100,
the model performance shows a clear declination in accuracy and
fairness. This experiment observation aligns with the analysis of
𝐾inLemma 3. After comparing both ΔSPandΔEO, we choose the
optimal result as our final selection for the parameter 𝐾. Specifically,
we select𝐾=1forIncome,𝐾=3forPokec-z,𝐾=2forPokec-n,
𝐾=10forGerman,𝐾=3forBail, and𝐾=6forCredit.
It worths mentioning that the best number of principal eigenvec-
tors to be kept varies across datasets. Hence, conducting compre-
hensive hyperparameter search would be beneficial to run FUGNN
effectively on new datasets. This also suggests a potential direction
for further improving FUGNN via developing efficient strategies
for parameter refining.
6.6 Training Cost Comparison
The whole eigendecomposition causes cubic complexity in terms
of the number of nodes, resulting in a computational cost of 𝑂(𝑛3).
The eigenvector selection eliminates the need to rank the eigenvec-
tors following the entire eigendecomposition process. The Arnolodi

According to the results, we observe greater time savings with
larger datasets. Especially for datasets where using the full decom-
position results in inference exceeding the available memory limits,
our method still works fine in such cases.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we examine the protection of sensitive features via
studying the similarity between the representations of those sen-
sitive features at the input layer and at deep latent space of the
model after𝑙layers of convolution operations. We establish a strong
correlation with the largest magnitude eigenvalue of the adjacency
matrix. Drawing inspiration from this finding, we have presented
FUGNN, an innovative approach dedicated to enhancing both the
fairness and utility of GNNs. FUGNN is built on two crucial com-
ponents: eigenvalue adjustment and optimization of eigenvector
distribution. These two components are designed based on our
theoretical findings, which simultaneously enhance the fairness
and utility of GNNs. The proposed FUGNN framework has demon-
strated significant improvements over strong baselines across di-
verse real-world scenarios. In future work, we plan to further refine
the efficiency of the FUGNN approach and extend its applicability
to situations with limited sensitive features.
