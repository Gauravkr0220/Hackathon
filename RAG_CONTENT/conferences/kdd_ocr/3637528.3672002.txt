Abstract
Cognitive diagnosis is a vital upstream task in intelligent educa-
tion systems. It models the student-exercise interaction, aiming
to infer the students’ proficiency levels on each knowledge con-
cept. This paper observes that most existing methods can hardly
effectively capture the homogeneous influence due to its inher-
ent complexity. That is to say, although students exhibit similar
performance on given exercises, their proficiency levels inferred
by these methods vary significantly, resulting in shortcomings in
interpretability and efficacy. Given the complexity of homogeneous
influence, a hypergraph could be a choice due to its flexibility and
capability of modeling high-order similarity which aligns with
the nature of homogeneous influence. However, before incorpo-
rating hypergraph, one at first needs to address the challenges of
distorted homogeneous influence, sparsity of response logs, and
over-smoothing. To this end, this paper proposes a hypergraph
cognitive diagnosis model (HyperCDM) to address these challenges
and effectively capture the homogeneous influence. Specifically, to
avoid distortion, HyperCDM employs a divide-and-conquer strat-
egy to learn student, exercise and knowledge representations in
their own hypergraphs respectively, and interconnects them via
a feature-based interaction function. To construct hypergraphs
based on sparse response logs, the auto-encoder is utilized to pre-
process response logs and 𝐾-means is applied to cluster students.
To mitigate over-smoothing, momentum hypergraph convolution

1 Introduction
Cognitive diagnosis [ 25,29] is a fundamental upstream task in intel-
ligent education systems [ 2], and extensive applications are found
in areas such as exercise recommendation [ 18] and computerized
adaptive testing [ 46]. An illustrative example is depicted in Figure 1.
Generally, students are tasked with completing some exercises (e.g.,
𝑒1,𝑒2,𝑒3,𝑒4), and educators can collect response logs. The main ob-
ject of cognitive diagnosis is to discover the students’ proficiency
levels on specific knowledge concepts (e.g., linear processing) and
exercises’ features (e.g., difficulty) via the analysis of these response
logs, which can be used in various downstream tasks.

Figure 2: The motivation example and preliminary study
results. The sampled response logs containing three similar
students whose IDs are 𝑠77,𝑠704and𝑠3307. Their inferred pro-
ficiency levels obtained by different CDMs on the real-world
dataset Math1 are visualized by t-SNE. Each point represents
a student and is assigned color ranging from red to purple
based on the correctness rates of their answers. Students with
similar correctness rates have similar colors, while with sim-
ilar inferred proficiency levels are positioned close.
In the past decades, considerable efforts have been invested in
th e development of cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), which
model the student-exercise interaction as a function, i.e., interac-
tion function. For example, traditional CDMs [ 7,30,36] incorporate
manually-designed interaction functions based on expert experi-
ence. In contrast, neural network-based CDMs [ 27,39,40] leverage
the multi-layer perceptron to enhance the generalization and in-
terpretability of diagnostic outcomes. Another approach, symbolic
CDM [ 34], introduces symbolic tree as an explicit representation
of non-linear intricate student-exercise interactions. Besides, some
CDMs utilizes large language model [ 23] to diagnose student based
on ample prior knowledge. Recently, a promising direction has
emerged that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the
structure of student-exercise-knowledge relation graphs, providing
valuable insights for cognitive diagnosis. For example, relation map
driven cognitive diagnosis model (RCD) [ 11] establishes relation
graphs to fully utilize the rich information.
Although aforementioned CDMs have made progress in cogni-
tive diagnosis, we have observed an important issue that is often
ignored by most existing CDMs: the homogeneous influenceamong students. In educational psychology, the homogeneous
influence among students is frequently explained by social learning
theory [ 3], suggesting that a student’s learning is influenced by
peers who exhibit similar behaviors or characteristics. However,
due to the multifaceted nature of learning and intricate non-linear
interaction among students, the backbones of existing CDMs may
not be flexible and complex enough, making them hard to capture
the homogeneous influence among students. Consequently, this
could lead to shortcoming in interpretability and efficacy of diag-
nosis, thereby impacting downstream tasks and the practical use of
teachers and students in real-world scenarios.
In order to understand this issue intuitively and support the mo-
tivation of this paper, we conduct a preliminary study of cognitive
diagnosis on the real-world dataset Math1 [ 26] to analyze four rep-
resentative CDMs (all tuned to optimum and data split identically).
The students’ proficiency levels obtained by them are visualized by
t-SNE [ 37] respectively. As shown in Figure 2, although their re-
sponse logs are similar and correctness rate is the same in (a), their
proficiency levels inferred by these methods separate significantly,
implying an inability to cluster similar students and suboptimal
performance in cognitive diagnosis. The quantitative experimental
results based on our proposed metrics in Section 5.2 also validate
the deficiencies when homogeneous influence is not considered.
Since the backbones of existing CDMs, such as the multi-layer
perceptron or pair-wise attention networks, may be inadequate in
effectively capturing the homogeneous influence among students,
a crucial question is then raised: Is there any more flexible and ef-
fective way to model the high-order and non-linear homogeneous
influence among students? Fortunately, the answer is YES: A hyper-
graph could offer an effective solution since it possesses significant
advantages in modeling high-order correlations [ 12] and is more
complex than pair-wise relations adopted by RCD, and has found
extensive applications in fields such as computer vision [ 19] and
recommendation systems [ 43]. However, directly applying the hy-
pergraph to cognitive diagnosis is not feasible due to the following
challenges: i) Distorted homogeneous influence. The use of
heterogeneous hypergraphs such as relation maps utilized by ex-
isting CDMs may lead to homogeneous influence among students
being distorted by interference from exercises and knowledge con-
cepts, finally reducing the interpretability and efficacy of diagnosis.
ii) Sparsity in response logs. Some work in other domains has
provided construction methods for hypergraphs [ 12]. However, be-
cause students may not complete every exercise, there is a high
degree of sparsity in response logs of some online datasets. Con-
structing a graph directly based on it could lead to a graph with
very few and sparse usable edges, hindering the effective utilization
of homogeneous influence. iii) Over-smoothing problem. The

GNNs-based CDMs with embedding propagation layers may diffi-
cultly provide distinguishable students’ proficiency levels, which
adversely affects the representation quality of diagnostic outcomes.
To this end, this paper proposes a hypergraph cognitive diagnosis
model (HyperCDM) to address these challenges and effectively cap-
ture the homogeneous influence. In particular, to avoid distortion,
HyperCDM employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to learn stu-
dent, exercise and knowledge concept representations in their own
hypergraphs respectively, and interconnects them via a feature-
based interaction function. To construct hypergraphs based on
sparse response logs, the auto-encoder is utilized to preprocess re-
sponse logs and 𝐾-means is applied to cluster students. To mitigate
over-smoothing, momentum hypergraph convolution networks
(MHGCN) are designed to partially keep previous representations
during the message propagation on the networks. In experimental
analysis, we also propose homogeneity index (HI) and consistency
index (CI) as metrics of the capability of capturing homogeneous
influence. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show
that HyperCDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in inter-
pretability and capturing the homogeneous influence, and compet-
itively strong performance in generalization. The ablation study
verifies the efficacy of each part in HyperCDM, hyperparameter
analysis provides some insights, and the case study explicitly show-
cases the homogeneous influence captured by HyperCDM.
In the subsequent sections, we respectively recap the related
work, introduce the preliminaries, present the proposed HyperCDM,
analyze the experimental results and finally conclude the paper.

Cognitive Diagnosis. Cognitive diagnosis is a vital field in educa-
tional psychology. Unlike knowledge tracing [ 1,6,35], it focuses on
the diagnosis of static cognitive states. In recent decades, consider-
able efforts have been invested in the development of cognitive diag-
nosis models (CDMs), such as item response theory (IRT) [ 30], mul-
tidimensional IRT (MIRT) [ 36], deterministic inputs, noisy and gate
model (DINA) [ 7], neural cognitive diagnosis model (NCDM) [ 39],
knowledge-association neural cognitive diagnosis model (KaNCD)
[40], Q-augmented causal cognitive diagnosis model (QCCDM) [ 27],
symbolic cognitive diagnosis model (SCDM) [ 34] and foundation
model enhanced cognitive diagnosis model (FineCD) [ 23]. These
methods model the student-exercise interaction as the interaction
function. Specifically, IRT, MIRT and DINA utilize interaction func-
tions annotated by experts. NCDM, KaNCD and QCCDM leverage
neural networks to capture intricate non-linear interactions, SCDM
utilizes symbolic regression to explicitly capture non-linear inter-
action, and FineCD utilizes LLMs. Recently, some research has
focused on graph-based CDMs since graphs can model more com-
plex relationships than previous ones. For example, relation map
driven cognitive diagnosis model (RCD) [ 11] and supervised graph
learning cognitive diagnosis model (SCD) [ 41] establishes relation
graphs to integrate structural information, and inductive cognitive
diagnosis model (ICDM) [ 28] designs student-centered graph to
aggregate neighbors’ embeddings for fast diagnosis. As aforemen-
tioned, however, we observe that these models may not be flexible
enough to effectively capture the homogeneous influence among
students, sometimes leading to deficiencies in diagnosis.Graph Representation Learning. In the past decades, graphs
have found widespread applications in data mining and machine
learning, whose representation learning, especially based on deep
learning techniques, has become a popular topic. The message-
passing graph neural networks (GNN) is the primary framework of
GNN, including graph convolutional networks (GCN) [ 21], graph at-
tention networks (GAT) [ 38], GraphSAGE [ 14] and others. Recently,
some work has focused on hypergraphs, where the traditional pair-
wise edges are expanded into hyperedges capable of connecting an
arbitrary number of nodes. To name a few, hypergraph convolution
networks (HGCN) [ 10] and hypergraph transformer [ 4,8]. As afore-
mentioned, directly adopting existing architecture is not feasible
due to the challenges of distorted homogeneous influence, sparsity
of response logs and over-smoothing. Note that while transformer-
based GNNs outperform traditional methods in alleviating over-
smoothing and over-squashing [ 24] issues, they require a larger
volume of training data to achieve the optimal performance [ 45]
and lack of interpretability, which is not suitable for this task.
3 Preliminaries
3.1 Cognitive Diagnosis
Let𝑆={𝑠1,...,𝑠|𝑆|},𝐸={𝑒1,...,𝑒|𝐸|}, and𝐾={𝑘1,...,𝑘|𝐾|}
respectively denote the sets of students, exercises and knowledge
concepts, where|·|calculates the size of set. Each student is required
to complete some exercises, and the corresponding response logs are
denoted as a set of triplets 𝑅={𝑠𝑖,𝑒𝑗,𝑟𝑖𝑗|𝑠𝑖∈𝑆,𝑒𝑗∈𝐸,𝑟𝑖𝑗∈{0,1}},
where𝑟𝑖𝑗represents the score (i.e., 𝑟𝑖𝑗=1means right while 𝑟𝑖𝑗=0
wrong) obtained by student 𝑠𝑖on exercise𝑒𝑗. Besides, the Q-matrix,
typically annotated by experts, is denoted as 𝑸={𝑞𝑖,𝑗}|𝐸|×|𝐾|,
which includes the relationship between exercises and knowledge
concepts. Here, 𝑞𝑖,𝑗=1if exercise𝑒𝑖is associated with knowledge
concept𝑘𝑗, and𝑞𝑖,𝑗=0otherwise.
Task Definition. Given the observed triplet logs of students
𝑅and the labeled Q-matrix 𝑸, the goal of the task is to infer the
students’ proficiency levels on knowledge concepts.
To ensure the interpretability, recent work also incorporates the
monotonicity assumption [ 32] and it is defined as Assumption 1.
We assess diagnostic outcomes based on it in Section 5.2.
Assumption 1 (Monotonicity Assumption). The probability
of providing a correct response to the exercise consistently rises with
the student’s proficiency level on relevant knowledge concepts.
Besides, as aforementioned, the homogeneous influence among
students is expected to play a crucial role in cognitive diagnosis [ 3],
but little attention has been devoted to this issue in previous studies.
We define this assumption as Assumption 2 based on social learning
theory [ 3] and assess diagnostic outcomes based on it in Section 5.2.
The similarity can be measured via distances like cosine.
Assumption 2 (Homogeneity Assumption). If students have
similar correctness rates and perform similarly in answering exercises,
their proficiency levels on relevant knowledge concepts are similar.

hyperedge of the hypergraph establishes connections among two
or more vertices. A hypergraph is defined as G=(V,E), including

4 Hypergraph Cognitive Diagnosis
An overview of the hypergraph cognitive diagnosis model (Hy-
perCDM) is shown in Figure 3. Sequentially, student, exercise and
knowledge hypergraphs are constructed in different strategies, and
their representations are learned by the momentum hypergraph
convolution networks (MHGCN). These embeddings are converted
to diagnostic features, and these features are unified via an inter-
action function. HyperCDM infers students’ proficiency levels by
predicting the response of students on some exercises.
4.1 Hypergraph Construction
Firstly, we consider the construction of the exercise hypergraph and
knowledge hypergraph. Unlike students’ response logs, exercises
and knowledge concepts inherently exhibit a low-noise relationship
matrix, i.e., Q-matrix 𝑸(similar to previous work, we affirm the
expert-annotated 𝑸is highly credible and needs no adjustment).
And the construction is shown as Eq. (2).
𝑯𝐸=𝑸,𝑯𝐾=𝑸⊤, (2)
where the 𝑯𝐸is the incidence matrix of the exercise hypergraph
and𝑯𝐾is that of the knowledge hypergraph, as shown in Fig-
ure 3 (a). Next, we tackle constructing the student hypergraph.
As mentioned before, students may not complete all exercises. Di-
rectly constructing a graph from their response logs could create
sparse edges, leading to inefficient use of homogeneous influence.
Therefore, inspired by [ 44], the construction method is depicted in
Figure 4. We convert triplet response logs into a more manageable
response matrix 𝑹as Eq. (3), where the ˆ𝒓𝑖is the𝑖-th column of re-
sponse matrix 𝑹(if not specified, all mentioned vectors are column

As shown in Figure 4 (a), we obtain clustering-friendly latent repre-
sentations via auto-encoder, i.e.,
˜𝒓𝑖=A(ˆ𝒓𝑖;ΘA),A(·;ΘA):R|𝐸|↦→R˜|𝐸|, (4)
where ˜𝒓𝑖is the latent response logs feature of student 𝑠𝑖,Ais
the non-linear encoder mapping, ˜|𝐸|is the dimension of latent
feature, and ΘAis a set of parameters of encoder. To improve
the performance of subsequent clustering, we pre-train the auto-
encoder via reconstruction loss Lrec, i.e.,
Lrec=|𝑆|∑︁
𝑖=1||A−1(A(ˆ𝒓𝑖;ΘA);ΘA−1)−ˆ𝒓𝑖||2, (5)
whereA−1(·;ΘA−1):R˜|𝐸|↦→R|𝐸|is the decoder, ΘA−1is its set
of parameters, and ||·|| 2is𝑙2norm.
After pre-training, we obtain the hypergraph using the overlap
𝐾-means. Initially, following the classical 𝐾-means [ 15], the op-
timization objective is defined as Eq. (6), where each column of

And we give the loss function of hypergraph construction,
Lcons=Lrec+Jclt. (7)
However, optimizing Eq. (7)is challenging since both the loss
function and the constraints are non-convex. Besides, scalability
issues should be taken into consideration. Therefore, after the
pre-training process, the clustering algorithm is shown in Algo-
rithm 1. Line 2 shows further optimization based on the pre-trained
auto-encoder using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer (e.g.,
Adam [ 20]). Line 4 entails reassigning the cluster centroids for each
student based on the Euclidean distance. In line 5, an adaptive ap-
proach [ 33] is employed to update the cluster centers, where 𝛿𝑖
𝑘is
the inverse of the frequency that the algorithm assigns students to
cluster𝑘before processing the incoming student 𝑠𝑖.
Finally, we construct a student hypergraph based on the Eu-
clidean distance between each student’s latent feature and centroids.
Initially, we compute the first quartile 𝛾0.25𝑘of the distances from
students to each clustering 𝑘, and fill incidence matrix of student
hypergraph 𝑯𝑆∈R|𝑆|×Kas follows in Figure 4 (b):
𝑯𝑆={ℎ𝑆𝑖,𝑘}, ℎ𝑆𝑖,𝑘=(

4.2 Hypergraph Convolution
Upon constructing hypergraphs, the next step is to learn the graph
representation. Given a hypergraph derived from datasets, the inci-
dent matrix 𝑯and vertex embeddings in 𝑙-th layer 𝑿(𝑙)are inputted
into hypergraph convolution networks [10, 12] defined as:
𝑿(𝑙+1)=𝜎
𝑫−1
2𝜈𝑯𝑫−1
𝜀𝑯⊤𝑫−1
2𝜈𝑿(𝑙)𝚯(𝑙)
, (9)where𝚯(𝑙)is a trainable parameter matrix at the 𝑙-th layer, and 𝜎(·)
denotes an non-linear activation function (e.g., Tanh ). However,
He et al . [16] utter that since each node has no concrete semantics
features, applying multi-layer non-linear feature transformation
(e.g., activation function) will increase training difficulty, impede
speed and impair performance. Besides, the over-smoothing prob-
lem is prevalent in message-passing GNNs. To expedite training,
enhance performance, and alleviate over-smoothing, we propose
the momentum hypergraph convolution networks (MHGCN) and
sum up the embeddings of each layer to combine them:
𝑿(𝑙+1)=𝑫−1
2𝜈𝑯𝑫−1
𝜀𝑯⊤𝑫−1
2𝜈𝑿(𝑙)+𝜂·𝑿(𝑙),
𝑿=1
1+𝐿𝐿∑︁
𝑙=0𝑿(𝑙),(10)
where𝜂is momentum parameter and 𝐿is the number of layers of
MHGCN. The omission of trainable parameter Θ(𝑙)and non-linear
transformations 𝜎accelerates training speed and improves perfor-
mance. To mitigate over-smoothing, we integrate embeddings from
previous layers partially during the update. This structural modifi-
cation’s efficacy is confirmed through ablation study in Section 5.2.
Based on MHGCN, as shown in Figure 3 (b), for each hypergraph,
the convolution is defined as Eq. (11).

4.3 Embedding Conversion
Some work [ 7,39] usually sets 𝑑embas the number of knowledge
concepts|𝐾|, and inputs them into the interaction functions. How-
ever, forcing the dimension to |𝐾|may reduce the performance.
This problem is commonly faced in some graph downstream tasks
like recommendation systems [ 16]. To address it, we first embed
students, exercises and knowledge concepts into a low-dimensional
latent space. After convolution, we apply a linear transformation to
increase dimension of embeddings, which is expressed as follows:
 
˜𝑿𝑆=𝜎(Linear𝑆(𝑿𝑆;Θ𝑆))
˜𝑿𝐸=𝜎(Linear𝐸(𝑿𝐸;Θ𝐸))
˜𝑿𝐾=𝜎(Linear𝐾(𝑿𝑆;Θ𝐾)), (13)
where Θ𝑆,Θ𝐸,Θ𝐾are parameters in each linear transformation,
Linear𝑆(·;Θ𝑆)is the mapping R|𝑆|×𝑑emb↦→R|𝑆|×𝑑feat,Linear𝐸(·;Θ𝐸)

and𝜎is the activation function (here is LeakyReLU). It is notewor-
thy that𝑑featmay not always equal |𝐾|, and typically it satisfies
𝑑feat≥|𝐾|>𝑑emb. This is because more parameters can result in
a more effective fit [ 17], which is also validated in hyperparame-
ter analysis of Section 5.2. At the same time, discrimination holds
equal importance as another aspect of exercise features (i.e., diffi-
culty) [ 25,29]. We obtain the discrimination 𝝃discbased on the exer-
cise embeddings, and employ a method similar to Eq. (13), as shown

4.4 Unified Diagnosis Layer
According to the principle of divide-and-conquer, we first model
students, exercises and knowledge concepts respectively using ho-
mogeneous hypergraphs, aiming to prevent interference from dif-
ferent types of nodes in capturing homogeneous influence; then,
we employ a unified interaction function to combine these three
components to simultaneously train these features. As illustrated
in Figure 3 (d), for student 𝑠𝑖and exercise 𝑒𝑗, the corresponding
proficiency level, exercise difficulty, discrimination and relevance
features are obtained as follows:
𝝃prof𝑖=˜𝑿𝐾˜𝑿⊤
𝑆𝒖𝑖,
s.t.𝒖𝑖∈{0,1}|𝑆|,1⊤𝒖𝑖=1,𝑢𝑖,𝑖=1 ;
𝝃diff𝑗=˜𝑿𝐾˜𝑿⊤
𝐸𝒛𝑗, 𝜉disc𝑗=𝝃⊤
disc𝒛𝑗,𝝃rele𝑗=𝑸⊤𝒛𝑗,
s.t.𝒛𝑗∈{0,1}|𝐸|,1⊤𝒛𝑗=1,𝑧𝑗,𝑗=1,(15)
where 𝝃prof𝑖,𝝃diff𝑗,𝝃rele𝑗∈R|𝐾|,𝜉disc𝑗∈R, and 𝒖𝑖,𝒛𝑗are one-
hot vectors. In Eq. (15), it is noteworthy that proficiency level and
difficulty are not directly obtained from feature matrices ˜𝑿𝑆,˜𝑿𝐸.
Instead, they are derived by multiplying ˜𝑿𝑆,˜𝑿𝐸with the knowl-
edge feature matrix ˜𝑿𝐾and extracting via one-hot vectors. This
is because: i)Performing a linear transformation via ˜𝑿𝐾to ensure
their dimensions correspond to |𝐾|, thereby ensuring interpretabil-
ity (distinguishing it from previous work like MIRT [ 36]).ii)In the
knowledge hypergraph, the implicit associations between knowl-
edge concepts can be learned and kept in ˜𝑿𝐾. By incorporating
these associations into ˜𝑿𝑆,˜𝑿𝐸, it is possible to predict proficiency
level even when a student has minimal exposure or zero-shot on a
particular knowledge concept (especially in online datasets where
students are not required to interact with all concepts) and enhances
interpretability and capturing the homogeneous influence.
After obtaining these diagnostic factors, we input them into the
unified diagnostic layers defined as:
𝑦𝑖𝑗=Sigmoid(MLP(𝜉disc𝑗×(𝝃prof𝑖−𝝃diff𝑗)◦𝝃rele𝑗;Θinter)),(16)
where𝑦𝑖𝑗is the prediction of the 𝑖-th student’s response on the

4.5 Discussion
We would like to emphasize some points related to HyperCDM.
Complexity. We consider both time complexity and space com-
plexity from two aspects: graph construction and graph learning.
Detailed analysis is shown in Table 1, where the number of stu-
dents|𝑆|is significantly larger than |𝐸|,|𝐾|, and we have omitted
the terms in the time complexity that only involve |𝐸|and|𝐾|.
Flexibility. In Figure 4, if necessary, we can also input additional
side-information to assist in the hypergraph construction, such as
students’ background information or the problem context. And in
Figure 3 (d), other types of interaction functions (e.g., MIRT and
DINA) are also applicable, and adjustments to diagnostic factors
can be made based on the specific requirements.
Training. The hypergraph construction, in relation to subse-
quent graph representation learning, serves as a “pre-training”
phase. Specifically, once hypergraphs are constructed, the struc-
ture remains unchanged thereafter, which ensures the hypergraph
construction does not become a bottleneck of the efficiency of subse-
quent representation learning. In essence, hypergraph construction
and graph learning are two mutually independent processes.

Dataset Description. The experiments are conducted on four
real-world datasets from both online (sparse) scenarios (NeurIPS20 [ 42],
EdNet-1 [ 5]) and offline (dense) scenarios (Math1, Math2 [ 26]).
These datasets cover common learning scenarios and are repre-
sentative, which can show our method’s versatility in various ed-
ucational scenarios. The density is computed as |𝑅|/(|𝑆|×|𝐸|). A
density value nearing 1 indicates that students have completed
nearly all exercises in the datasets, which is often seen in offline
datasets. Conversely, a density value nearing 0 suggests that stu-
dents may only complete a subset of the exercises in the datasets,
which is often seen in online datasets. Details of these datasets are
shown in Table 2, and their sources are explained in Appendix A.1.
Baselines and State-of-the-Art Methods. In recent decades,
various CDMs have been developing, some of which are represen-
tative methods and selected for comparison: MIRT [ 36], DINA [ 7],
NCDM [ 39], KaNCD [ 40], KSCD [ 31] and RCD [ 11]. Since graph-
based CDMs are less explored, we choose the strong model RCD as
a representative graph-based model for comparison. Note that these
methods are all open source and adjusted to optimum according to
their recommended settings in the paper. Details of these methods
and the source are shown in Appendix A.2.
Generalization Metrics. Assessing the performance of CDM
proves challenging due to the inherent difficulty in accurately ob-
serving students’ proficiency levels. To address this challenge, a
widely accepted strategy is to evaluate them by predicting students’
test scores. Similar to previous methods [ 11,39], we evaluate how
close the model predicts whether a student solves an exercise to
the ground truth in the test set with common classification metrics,
i.e., accuracy (Acc.), area under curve (AUC) and F1-score (F1).
Interpretability Metric. Generalization metrics are only one
facet of assessing the performance of CDMs. In previous work, de-
gree of agreement (DOA) [ 39,40] is usually applied to quantitatively
assess the interpretability of diagnostic outcomes. As Assumption 1,
if student𝑠𝑎shows higher accuracy in responding to exercises re-
lated to𝑘𝑖than student 𝑠𝑏, it implies the proficiency level of 𝑠𝑎
on knowledge concept 𝑘𝑖(𝝃prof𝑎,𝑖) may surpass that of student 𝑠𝑏
(𝝃prof𝑏,𝑖). The DOA of 𝑘𝑖is defined as Eq. (18).
𝐷
𝑂𝐴(𝑖)=1
𝑍1|𝑆|Í
𝑎=1|𝑆|Í
𝑏=1Λ(𝝃pr
of𝑎,𝑖,𝝃prof𝑏,𝑖)|𝐸|Í
𝑗=1𝑞𝑗,𝑖𝐼(𝑗,𝑎,𝑏)·Λ(𝑟𝑎𝑗,𝑟𝑏𝑗)
𝐼(𝑗
,𝑎,𝑏),(18)
where𝑍1=Í|𝑆|
𝑎=1Í|𝑆|
𝑏=1Λ(𝝃prof𝑎,𝑖,𝝃prof𝑏,𝑖), and 𝝃prof𝑎,𝑖is the profi-
ciency level of student 𝑠𝑎on knowledge concept 𝑘𝑖.Λ(𝑥,𝑦)=1if
𝑥>𝑦and otherwise Λ(𝑥,𝑦)=0.𝑞𝑗𝑖=1if exercise𝑒𝑗contains
knowledge concept 𝑘𝑖and otherwise 𝑞𝑗𝑖=0.𝐼(𝑗,𝑎,𝑏)=1if both
student𝑠𝑎and𝑠𝑏complete exercise 𝑒𝑗and otherwise 𝐼(𝑗,𝑎,𝑏)=0.
For DOA, a greater value indicates stronger interpretability and ad-
herence to Assumption 1. To evaluate each knowledge concept, weaverage𝐷𝑂𝐴(𝑖)across all knowledge concepts for offline datasets
(i.e., DOA) and the top-10 frequent ones for online datasets (i.e.,
DOA@10), which is consistent with previous work [22, 27].
Homogeneity Metrics. To assess whether the model success-
fully captures the homogeneous influence among students, we
propose two metrics: homogeneity index (HI) and consistency in-
dex (CI). As Assumption 2, if the correctness rate of students 𝑠𝑎
and𝑠𝑏are equal, it implies that their proficiency levels should be
similar and comparable. Based on it, the 𝐻𝐼is defined as Eq. (19).
𝐻𝐼=1
𝑍2|𝑆|∑︁
𝑎=1|𝑆|∑︁
𝑏=1𝝃prof𝑎−𝝃prof𝑏2×𝐽(𝑎,𝑏), (19)
where𝑍2=Í|𝑆|
𝑎=1Í|𝑆|
𝑏=1𝐽(𝑎,𝑏). The function 𝐽(𝑎,𝑏)=1if both
students𝑠𝑎and𝑠𝑏(𝑎≠𝑏) have an identical correctness rate and
otherwise𝐽(𝑎,𝑏)=0. The correctness rate is computed as the ratio
of correctly answered exercises to the total number of attempted
exercises. Besides, Assumption 2 also considers that students with
similar response logs should have similar proficiency levels. There-
fore, we present the formula for calculating CI as Eq. (20).
𝐶𝐼=1
𝑍3|𝑆|∑︁
𝑎=1|𝑆|∑︁
𝑏=1𝝃prof𝑎−𝝃prof𝑏2·ˆ𝒓⊤𝑎·ˆ𝒓𝑏
||ˆ𝒓𝑎||2×||ˆ𝒓𝑏||2
,(20)
where𝑍3=|𝑆|(|𝑆|−1)and·denotes the inner product. ˆ𝒓𝑎is the
𝑎-th column of the response matrix given in Section 4.1, and also
the student 𝑠𝑎’s response logs. For both HI and CI, a smaller value
indicates stronger homogeneity and adherence to Assumption 2. To
deeply understand these two metrics, please refer to Appendix A.4.
However, DOA, HI and CI are only applicable for NCDM, KaNCD,
KSCD and RCD since the diagnostic outcomes of MIRT only ex-
hibit vague correspondence between latent traits and knowledge
concepts, and DINA is confined to discrete representation.
Experiment Settings. During training, we initialize parameters
in all networks with Xavier normal initialization [ 13] and use Adam
optimizer [ 20] with a learning rate being 0.0001. The batch size is
64for all datasets and the 𝑙2-regularization parameter 𝛼=0.0005.
To evaluate performance, we perform an 80%/20% train/test split of
response logs, and the hypergraph construction is only based on
the train set. All experiments are repeated independently with 10
seeds. More Implementation details are shown in Appendix A.3.
5.2 Experimental Results
We conduct comprehensive experiments to analyze the experimen-
tal results and answer the aforementioned research questions.
Homogeneous Influence (Q1). The performance on homo-
geneity of all methods is shown in Table 3, and the variance of each
metric is less than 0.05. From the table: i)By𝑡-test, HyperCDM
outperforms all baselines and state-of-the-art methods with sig-
nificant level 𝛼=5%in terms of homogeneity metrics HI and CI,
indicating that our model can effectively capture the homogeneous
influence among students. ii)Based on the HI and CI values, we sort
all comparative methods from low to high and observe that RCD
performs best, while KSCD worst. These findings align with the
preliminary results depicted in Figure 2, that is to say, in Figure 2
(c) (i.e., KSCD), the distance between similar students is farthest,
whereas in (e) (i.e., RCD), the distance is relatively closer. iii)In each

dataset, graph-based methods (HyperCDM and RCD) show simi-
lar magnitudes for HI and CI values, indicating graph structures
improve capturing the homogeneous influence among students.
However, simple pair-wise graphs fall short in effectively capturing
complex relationships, leading to HyperCDM outperforming RCD.
Interpretability (Q2) In Table 3, by 𝑡-test, HyperCDM reaches
state-of-the-art performance in terms of interpretability metric
DOA, and its variance is less than 0.05. The relative improvements
(%) over the best baselines are 1.25%, 3.61%, 3.28%and3.27%for
NeurIPS20, EdNet-1, Math1 and Math2 respectively, and those over
the RCD are 26.0%,19.8%,4.30%and4.16%. It demonstrates that: i)
HyperCDM not only effectively captures homogeneous influence
but also enhances the interpretability via hypergraph structure.
ii)Compared to the graph-based method RCD, HyperCDM sig-
nificantly outperforms it, especially in online datasets NeurIPS20
and EnNet-1. This indicates the hypergraph is more flexible and
effective than pair-wise graphs, and validates the effectiveness of
our hypergraph construction strategy in handling sparse online
interaction. Specifically, while RCD directly constructs a relation
map based on sparse response logs [ 11], we construct hypergraphs
via their latent features to avoid this problem.
Generalization (Q3). The performance of baseline methods
and HyperCDM on generalization are illustrated in Figure 5, which
shows the ranking distribution of a model across the four datasets
for a specific metric. The HyperCDM secures all top positions in
both Acc. and F1, while also achieving commendable performanceTable 4: Ablation study of HyperCDM. By 𝑡-test, a bold one is
significantly better than others on the corresponding metrics
with significant level 𝛼=5%. To intuitively understand the
function of each component, we visualize the corresponding
proficiency level by t-SNE (similar to Figure 2).

on AUC. This suggests that HyperCDM not only excels in capturing
homogeneous influence and interpretability but also shows strong
competitiveness in terms of generalization. Detailed statistics are
shown in Appendix B.1 and Table 6.
Ablation Study (Q4). We conduct an ablation study to evaluate
several variants including: (a) HyperCDM w.o. Mon that does not
use momentum strategy in MHGCN (i.e., let 𝜂=0); (b) HyperCDM
w.o. Con that does not convert low-dimensional embeddings to
high-dimensional features; (c) HyperCDM w.o. G that replaces
constructed hypergraphs with random graphs; (d) HyperCDM w.o.
Lthat directly construct hypergraphs based on sparse response logs.
As shown in Table 4, HyperCDM outperforms all variants. Besides,
we observe that utilizing latent features for hypergraph construc-
tion and momentum in MHGCN enhances the distinctiveness and
establishes a more evident sequential relationship among students
in t-SNE figure. We also find that converting embeddings into fea-
tures makes the arrangement of points more compact and orderly,

aligning with Assumption 2. Compared with random graphs, stu-
dents’ proficiency levels obtained by HyperCDM better match their
correctness rate. More details can be found in Appendix B.2.
Hyperparameter Analysis (Q5). We conduct a hyperparame-
ter experiment and the results of 𝑑emb,𝑑featon Math1 are shown
in Figure 6. Without loss of generality, we find that: i)Optimal
interpretability is often achieved with high dimension of both fea-
ture space and embeddings because more dimension enriches the
representation. ii)Optimal homogeneity is usually achieved with
low dimension of both feature space and embeddings. iii)Optimal
generalization is typically achieved with a high-dimensional fea-
ture space and a low-dimensional embedding. Thus, they mutually
constrain each other. To optimize performance, we can choose high-
dimensional features, and improve the homogeneity and generaliza-
tion by choosing low-dimensional embeddings (as we mentioned in
Section 4.3). Comprehensive analysis can be found in Appendix B.3.
Scalability Analysis (Q6). Table 5 presents the runtime of base-
line methods and proposed HyperCDM on the same hardware
devices (details of the devices are shown in Section A.3). Graphs
offer significant benefits in modeling complex relationships but at
the cost of increased time requirements. Compared with traditional
and neural network-based cognitive diagnosis models, graph-based
models are slower. To address this, our model uses a lightweight
network to reduce time disadvantages. Specifically, our model oper-
ates significantly faster compared to RCD. And even on large-scale
datasets (i.e., NeurIPS20 and EdNet-1), HyperCDM can still com-
plete diagnosis within the timeframe that static cognitive diagnosis
can tolerate. Therefore, HyperCDM can be applied to large-scale
datasets under the current task setting.

Case Study (Q7). Considering an educator conducts cognitive
diagnosis with HyperCDM, and the results are shown in Figure 7. In
(a), compared with other methods of Figure 2, three similar students
are positioned closer, and they all exhibit deficiencies in nearly iden-
tical knowledge concepts ( 𝑘4,𝑘5,𝑘11), as shown in (c). This indicates
that HyperCDM can effectively capture homogeneous influence
among students. Moreover, HyperCDM can learn the implicit asso-
ciations among concepts from the knowledge hypergraph. In (b),
we apply𝐾-means on knowledge concepts features ( 𝐾=4) and
observe that semantically related concepts are clustered together.
For example, 𝑘3,𝑘6,𝑘7are all related to function, and 𝑘5,𝑘8are ge-
ometry. In summary, HyperCDM effectively helps teachers identify
similar students for tailored instruction and discover connections
between knowledge points, enhancing teaching methods.
6 Conclusion
This paper first observes a key issue that is often neglected by previ-
ous work: the homogeneous influence among students. To capture
the homogeneous influence, we propose a hypergraph cognitive
diagnosis model (HyperCDM) to model flexible and high-order rela-
tionships among students. To avoid distortion, HyperCDM employs
a divide-and-conquer strategy to learn different kinds of represen-
tations and unifies them via a feature-based interaction function.
To construct the hypergraph based on sparse response logs, the
auto-encoder is used to learn latent features to cluster students.
To alleviate over-smoothing, momentum hypergraph convolution
networks are designed. Experiment results show that HyperCDM
excels in capturing the homogeneous influence. The future work
of HyperCDM includes further enhancing its generalization and
landing it on more real-world intelligent education scenarios.

Appendix
The appendix is organized as follows:
•Appendix A presents the details of datasets, methods, implemen-
tation, and explanation of proposed metrics HI and CI.
•Appendix B presents detailed statistics of performance on gener-
alization, ablation study and other hyperparameter analysis results.
•Appendix C presents the limitations of our method.
A Experiment Details
A.1 Datasets Sources
We conduct experiments on four real-world datasets. Note that
these datasets are open-accessible and do not involve ethical issues
such as data collection. Their sources are introduced below.
Math1 and Math2. The datasets are collected from high school
students who participate in their final exams during their first and
second senior years, respectively. They include both objective and
subjective problems. However, to align with previous work, we
only consider the objective problems.
NeurIPS20. This dataset is used in the NeurIPS 2020 Education
Challenge. It encompasses four semesters (September 2018 to May
2020) of students’ answers to mathematics exercises from Eedi, a
leading educational platform which students interact with daily
from all around the world. We only use utilize the dataset offered
for cognitive diagnosis in this competition.
EdNet-1. This dataset contains all student-system interactions
collected over 2 years by Santa, a multi-platform AI tutoring service
in Korea. The 1means the first section of the huge dataset.
In the main paper, we state, “These datasets cover common
learning scenarios and are representative,” because they include
both online and offline environments, as well as middle school and
high school levels, and also cover students from different locations.
A.2 Baselines and State-of-the-Art Methods
We compare with six baseline and state-of-the-art methods includ-
ing transitional CDMs, neural CDMs and the graph-based CDM.
All of them are open-source and available at https://github.com/
bigdata-ustc/EduCDM.
•MIRT [36] extends the IRT by adopting multidimensional
vectors to model latent traits of students and exercises. The simple
form of the interaction function is defined as
𝑃(𝑟𝑖𝑗=1)=1
1+𝑒−1.7(𝒂⊤
𝑗𝜽𝑖−𝜷𝑗),
where𝑃(𝑟𝑖𝑗=1)is the probability that student 𝑠𝑖answers the
exercise𝑒𝑗correctly, 𝒂𝑗∈R𝑑is the discrimination of exercise 𝑗,
𝜽𝑖∈R𝑑is the latent traits of students, and 𝜷𝑗∈R𝑑is that of
exercises. Note that 𝑑≠|𝐾|, i.e., each dimension of traits does not
correspond to the specific knowledge concepts.
•DINA [7] is a conjunctive assumption-based model, where
proficiency levels are denoted by discrete binary values. The inter-
action function is defined as
𝑃(𝑟𝑖𝑗=1)=𝑔1−𝜂𝑖𝑗
𝑗(1−𝑠𝑗)𝜂𝑖𝑗, 𝜂𝑖𝑗=Ö
𝑘𝜃𝛽𝑖𝑗
𝑖𝑗,
where𝑔𝑗is the probability of correctly guessing exercise 𝑒𝑗,𝑠𝑗is
the probability of making a careless mistake on exercise 𝑒𝑗,𝜃𝑖𝑗∈{0,1}denotes whether student 𝑖masters knowledge concept 𝑗, and
𝛽𝑖𝑗∈0,1donates whether exercise 𝑖includes concept 𝑗.
•NCDM [39] adopts neural networks in replacement of man-
ually designed interaction functions and outperforms traditional
CDMs on most datasets in generalization and interpretability. The
interaction function are multi-layer position perceptron.
•KaNCD [40] builds upon the advancements of NCDM, consid-
ers implicit associations between knowledge concepts, and achieves
state-of-the-art results across most datasets.
•KSCD [31] explores implicit relationships between knowledge
concepts and exercises, employing a novel interaction function.
•RCD [11] explores intricate relationships among students,
exercises, and knowledge attributes, employing a graph attention
network to model these connections.
A.3 Implementation Details
In hypergraph construction, we set the number of clusters K=
0.02|𝑆|, the dimension of latent response logs feature ˜𝐸=64; the net-
work dimension of auto-encoder is [512,256,128], the pre-training
epoch is 100, and the 𝐾-means clustering epoch 𝑇is50. In diag-
nostic layers, the network dimension of MLP is[512,256,128]. In
MHGCN, the number of layers 𝐿=4, the momentum 𝜂=0.8, and
the dimension of embeddings 𝑑emb=16. In embedding conversion,
the dimension of feature 𝑑feat=512.
When selecting hyperparameters, we adopt the cross-validation
method, which involves a portion of the training set as a validation
set for parameter selection, and utilizing grid search to explore the
parameters. Through the pilot study, we determined the hyperpa-
rameters for HyperCDM.
All models are implemented by Pytorch [ 9] framework and per-
formed on CUDA 11.1. All experiments are conducted on a Linux
server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPU and NVIDIA V100-
32GB GPU.
A.4 Metrics Explanation
To deeply understand HI and CI, we give an example to show how
to evaluate models’ performance on homogeneity via our proposed
metrics. Assuming that we have two cognitive diagnostic models,
A and B, and a response matrix formed by students 𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑠3and
exercises𝑒1,𝑒2,𝑒3as follows.
𝑹=1−1−1
−1 1 1
1−1−1,
where each column signifies the response logs of the corresponding
student. The diagnostic outcomes after employing the cognitive
diagnostic models would be as follows, and each column signifies
the proficiency levels of the corresponding student.
𝝃prof𝐴=0.4 0.7 0.7
0.6 0.2 0.3
0.9 0.2 0.1,𝝃prof𝐵=0.5 0.8 0.6
0.6 0.3 0.1
0.9 0.4 0.2.
We find that A significantly outperforms B. Given the similarity
in students’ interaction records, their proficiency levels should be
equivalent.
Then we try to evaluate with proposed metrics. To calculate
HI, we first compute the correctness rate of each student, i.e.,

of each entry is less than 0.05. By𝑡-test, HyperCDM significantly
outperforms other methods on Acc. and F1 with significant level
𝛼=5%, and performs competitively with other methods on AUC.
B.2 Ablation Study
In addition to the metrics presented in Table 4 (i.e., Acc., AUC, HI,
and DOA), we also conducted experiments involving F1 and CI,
as depicted in Table 7. The results still indicate that HyperCDM
outperforms all other HyperCDM variants.
B.3 Hyperparameter Analysis
We conducted a hyperparameter experiment on 𝑑feat,𝑑embin Math1,
as well as experiments on the number of layers 𝐿and momentum
𝜂in MHGCN across two offline datasets (without loss of gener-
ality, and similar to NeurIPS20 and EdNet-1), as depicted in Ta-
ble 8. The𝑑feat∈{64,128,256,512,1024},𝑑emb∈{8,16,32,64,128},
𝐿∈ {1,2,3,4,5}, and𝜂∈ {0.0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0}. We find the
trend in hyperparameter analysis of Section 5.2 persists across all
datasets:𝑑emb,𝑑featmutually constrain each other. Thus, to opti-
mize performance, we can choose high-dimensional features, and
improve the homogeneity and generalization by choosing low-
dimensional embeddings (as we mentioned in Section 4.3). We also
observe that a momentum value 𝜂around 0.8 is most suitable, since
small values fail to mitigate over-smoothing, while overly large val-
ues result in the MHGCN consistently prioritizing representations
of the previous layer. Additionally, 𝐿=4reaches optimal in most
datasets, because shallow GNNs struggle to capture the structure of
the graph, while overly deep ones may encounter over-smoothing.
C Limitations
Our model might occasionally struggle with scenarios involving
millions of students because graph (including hypergraph) repre-
sentation learning faces many challenges in the face of large-scale
data. This paper is focused on how to effectively apply hypergraphs
to capturing homogeneous influence among students, and we hope
it can be addressed in the future work.
