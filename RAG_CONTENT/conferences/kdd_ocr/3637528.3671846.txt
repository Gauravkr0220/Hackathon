ABSTRACT
An irregular tensor is a collection of matrices with different num-
bers of rows. Real-world data from diverse domains, including
medical and stock data, are effectively represented as irregular ten-
sors due to the inherent variations in data length. For their analysis,
various tensor decomposition methods (e.g., PARAFAC2) have been
devised. While they are expected to be effective in compressing
large-scale irregular tensors, akin to regular tensor decomposition
methods, our analysis reveals that their compression performance
is limited due to the larger number of first mode factor matrices.
In this work, we propose accurate and compact decomposition
methods for lossy compression of irregular tensors. First, we pro-
pose Light-IT, which unifies all first mode factor matrices into a
single matrix, dramatically reducing the size of compressed out-
puts. Second, motivated by the success of Tucker decomposition in
regular tensor compression, we extend Light-IT to Light-IT++to
enhance its expressive power and thus reduce compression error.
Finally, we generalize both methods to handle irregular tensors of
any order and leverage the sparsity of tensors for acceleration.
Extensive experiments on 6 real-world datasets demonstrate that
our methods are (a) Compact: their compressed output is up to
37×smaller than that of the most concise baseline, (b) Accurate:
our methods are up to 5 ×more accurate, with smaller compressed
output, than the most accurate baseline, and (c) Versatile: our
methods are effective for sparse, dense, and higher-order tensors.

1 INTRODUCTION
A (regular) tensor is a multi-dimensional array [ 21]. Diverse real-
world datasets, such as image databases [ 35,36], semantic graphs [ 22],
and email histories [ 2], have been represented as tensors due to
their high-dimensional nature. The number of the dimensions of
a tensor is called the order of the tensor. A 𝑑-order tensor can be
viewed as a collection of (𝑑−1)-order tensors of the same size.
A𝑑-order irregular tensor is a collection of(𝑑−1)-order ten-
sors with potentially varying sizes, specifically in the first mode.
For instance, a 3-order irregular tensor is a collection of matrices
with varying numbers of rows (refer to Fig. 1 for an example from
EHRs [ 28,38]). In many real-world datasets (e.g., EHRs), the lengths
of data (e.g. visits counts) vary depending on objects (e.g. patients),
and thus they have been represented as irregular tensors [11, 16].
Given the immense sizes of real-world irregular tensors, com-
pressing them is often necessary for efficient analysis and storage.
In the case of a dense irregular tensor, storing it, without any com-
pression, requires memory proportional to the number of entries,
and the storage cost grows exponentially to the order of the tensor
since the number of entries in each slice grows exponentially to it.
When saving a spare irregular tensor, only indices and values of
non-zero entries are stored, but still, it can be a memory burden.
For example, the EHR dataset that saves the diagnoses of patients
contains 50 million non-zero entries [29].
For regular tensors (or matrices), a number of compression meth-
ods have been developed based on tensor (or matrix) decomposition.
CUR [ 8] and CMD [ 32] decompositions for matrices decrease the
memory space for the factor matrices when they are applied to
sparse matrices because their factor matrices are sparse and can be
saved in sparse matrix formats such as the COO format. Their com-
pression abilities are better than T-SVD (Truncated Singular Value
Decomposition) [ 13], as empirically shown in [ 24]. NeuKron [ 24]
and TensorCodec [ 25] use neural networks to increase the com-
pression abilities of Kronecker product and Tensor-Train (TT) de-
composition [26], respectively.

A 3-order Irregular Tensor
Figure 1: An example of a 3-order irregular tensor.
In contrast, there is no advanced decomposition method special-
ized for the compression of an irregular tensor. PARAFAC2 decom-
position [ 14], known for its utility in phenotype discovery [ 1,29],
fault detection [ 17,37], and tracking users’ interest [ 33], may be
appealing also for compression purposes. However, our analysis
reveals that it requires a large number of factor matrices for the
first mode, limiting a compression ability. In addition, their design
only targets irregular tensors whose orders are three.
In this paper, we propose Light-IT and Light-IT++, which are
accurate and compact decompositions of irregular tensors for lossy
compression. In Light-IT, multiple factor matrices for the first mode
in PARAFAC2 decomposition are reduced to a single vocabulary
matrix, dramatically decreasing the number of parameters. Note
that how PARAFAC2 decomposition (and Light-IT) approximates
an entry is similar to how CP decomposition [ 15] does. Light-IT++
enhances the expressiveness (and thus reduces the compression
error) of Light-IT by generalizing its approximation scheme to
mimic Tucker decomposition [ 34], renowned for its effectiveness
in regular-tensor compression. Moreover, the designs and imple-
mentations of our methods can handle an irregular tensor whose
order is higher than three. Finally, our methods exploit the sparsity
of a sparse irregular tensor to reduce the time complexity.
We show the following advantages of our methods through
experiments in 6 real-world datasets:
•Compact: Our methods give outputs up to 37 ×more concise than
the best baseline with similar fitness (i.e., compression accuracy).
•Accurate: Their fitness is up to 5 times better than the most
accurate baseline with similar compressed output sizes.
•Versatile: Our methods effectively compress various types of
irregular tensors, including sparse, dense, and higher-order ones.
Reproducibility: The code and datasets are available at [23].
We present related works in Section 2 and preliminaries in Sec-
tion 3. Then, we analyze the memory bottleneck of PARAFAC2
decomposition in Section 4. The proposed methods are provided
in Section 5, followed by experiments in Section 6. We finalize our
paper with conclusions in Section 7.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we review decomposition-based methods for com-
pressing regular and irregular tensors.
General-purpose regular tensor decompositions: CP (Canoni-
cal Polyadic) [ 15] and Tucker [ 34] decompositions have been widely
used for the factorization of regular tensors, serving general pur-
poses including compression. Those methods decompose a regular
tensor into small factor matrices (including a core tensor in the
case of Tucker), which the original tensor can be approximated
from. However, they cannot be directly applied to irregular tensor
compression due to their designs being focused on regular tensors.
One naive approach is to pad zero-valued rows to transform theirregular tensor into a regular one and then apply the methods.
However, zero-padding introduces incorrect information, and it
can hinder the effective capture of the different semantics of the
first mode indices (e.g., visits in Fig. 1) depending on the final mode
indices (e.g., patients), as empirically verified in Section 6.3.
Regular tensor compressions: For a sparse matrix, CUR [ 8] and
CMD [ 32] compress it into a small dense matrix and tall sparse
factor matrices. These sparse matrices are randomly sampled from
the input, and they are stored in sparse formats further reducing
space costs. Recently, deep-learning-based methods have been in-
troduced to enhance regular tensor compression. NeuKron [ 24]
approximates a sparse and reorderable tensor through the Kro-
necker product of small tensors generated by an RNN, trained with
an ordering optimization to exploit meaningful patterns in the in-
put. TensorCodec [ 25] extends Tensor-Train decomposition [ 26]
by incorporating an RNN. TensorCodec optimizes the RNN while
reordering and folding the input tensor simultaneously. However,
those methods are not suitable for irregular tensor compression,
particularly due to their design limitations in ordering optimization
exclusive for regular tensors and their heavy computations.
General-purpose irregular tensor decompositions: To decom-
pose an irregular tensor, PARAFAC2 decomposition [ 14] has been
introduced, and it factorizes each slice of the irregular tensor into
distinct factor and diagonal matrices depending on the first mode
and a shared factor matrix. Various methods have been proposed
to compute PARAFAC2 decomposition under different settings and
algorithms. PARAFAC2-ALS [ 19] is a representative method ex-
ploiting the alternative least square (ALS) algorithm. SPARTan [ 28]
leverages the sparsity in sparse irregular tensors for better effi-
ciency. To efficiently handle a dense irregular tensor, RD-ALS [ 6]
preprocesses it via a dimension reduction, and DPar2 [ 16] employs
randomized SVD [ 12] with careful ordering of computations. For
interpretability, COPA [ 1] introduces several constraints such as
temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the objective
function of PARAFAC2 decomposition. REPAIR [ 29] is designed
to maintain robustness against missing and erroneous values for
PARAFAC2 decomposition. HyTuck2 [ 4] generalizes Tucker de-
composition for irregular tensors, in a manner similar to how
PARAFAC2 extends CP decomposition. The algorithmic design
of all aforementioned methods is restricted to 3-order irregular ten-
sors, while BTD2 [ 3] is a variant of PARAFAC2 for 4-order irregular
tensors. Although the results of all decompositions above can serve
as irregular tensor compression, it still lacks compactness due to
the dominance of the first mode factor matrices across all slices,
resulting in a substantial space requirement for compressed outputs
(refer to Section 4 for the analysis on PARAFAC2). Furthermore,
our methods can cope with irregular tensors of any order.

3.2 PARAFAC2 Decomposition
Given a 3-order irregular tensor {X𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1where X𝑘∈R𝑁𝑘×𝑀,
PARAFAC2 decomposition [ 14] compresses X𝑘toU𝑘∈R𝑁𝑘×𝑅,
S∈R𝐾×𝑅, and V∈R𝑀×𝑅where𝑅is the rank of the decomposition.
The slice X𝑘is approximated by U𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(S(𝑘,:))V⊺where U𝑘is
distinct for each slice index 𝑘. Harshman et al. [ 14] introduced an
additional constraint ensuring that U⊤
𝑘U𝑘is the same for all indices
𝑘. This constraint leads to the uniqueness of each U𝑘in the solution
space, and the constraint is satisfied by replacing each U𝑘with
Q𝑘Hwhere Q𝑘is a column orthonormal matrix with 𝑅columns.
PARAFAC2 decomposition is formulated as follows:

optimizes each term in Θwhile fixing the other parameters.

irregular tensor. The other components are the vocabulary matrix
and the factor matrices for the modes except for the first mode. In
the case of Light-IT++, a core tensor is also included in D.
4 BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS
In this section, we aim to analyze a limitation of PARAFAC2 decom-
position as a solution of Problem 1. A commonly considered ap-
proach for compressing a 3-order irregular tensor is to use PARAFAC2
decomposition. However, its compression level is very limited due
to the sizeÍ𝐾
𝑘=1𝑁𝑖𝑅of the first mode factor matrices {U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1
which are much larger than the other factor matrices. Fig. 2 shows
that the number of parameters in {U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1overwhelmingly sur-
passes those in the remaining parameters (S andV) for all datasets.
In light of this result, it is crucial to reduce the size of {U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1to
achieve a higher compression performance. Our proposed Light-
IT and Light-IT++, which are explained in the following sections,
focus on overcoming this limitation without an accuracy loss.
5 PROPOSED METHOD
In this section, we present our proposed methods for Problem 1.
5.1 Overview
The technical challenges in addressing Problem 1 are as follows.
Q1.Compactness. As analyzed in Section 4, the compression
capability of PARAFAC2 decomposition is limited due to the
first mode factor matrices, requiring a substantial compression
size. How can we compress it more compactly?
Q2.Expressiveness. How can we increase the expression power
to fit irregular tensors of more complicated patterns that cannot
be expressed with low-rank PARAFAC2 decomposition?
Q3.Handling large sparse irregular tensors. Sparse irregular
tensors usually have large dimensions with few non-zero en-
tries, requiring much time if treated as dense tensors. How can
we efficiently compress them?
Q4.Handling higher-order irregular tensors. Real-world irreg-
ular tensors often have orders higher than three. How can we
compress such higher-order irregular tensors?
We provide the following solutions to handle the challenges above.
A1.Vocabulary-based compression. We devise a vocabulary-
based compression that maps the rows of the first mode factor
matrices to those of a single compact vocabulary matrix.
A2.Extension with core tensor. We extend the vocabulary-based
compression by incorporating a core tensor, similar to how
Tucker decomposition approximates a target tensor.

which employs operations involving only non-zero entries.
A4.Higher-order design. We design a higher-order version of
our methods through careful matricizations of irregular tensors
with higher orders.
In the following subsections, we describe our compact and accu-
rate irregular tensor compression methods, Light-IT and Light-IT++.
Light-IT compresses an input irregular tensor with the vocabulary
matrix, thereby reducing the compression size (Section 5.2). To
enhance expressiveness, we extend it to Light-IT++based on the
Tucker decomposition, where the initial parameters of Light-IT++
are set to the outputs of Light-IT (Section 5.3). Efficient designs of
Light-IT and Light-IT++for sparse irregular tensors and extensions
to higher-order irregular tensors are explained in the corresponding
subsections. For simplicity, we initially describe our methods in the
context of a 3-order irregular tensor and subsequently extend the
explanation to higher-order irregular tensors.
5.2 Light-IT: Vocabulary-based Compression
To achieve compact compression, our main idea for Light-IT is to
compress{U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1into a single compact vocabulary matrix Pthat
is partially shared across all slices for the approximation. Specif-
ically, Light-IT learns U𝑘∈R𝑁𝑘×𝑅andP∈R𝐷×𝑅, and mapping
functions{𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1are computed from them. Here 𝜋𝑘:[𝑁𝑘]→[𝐷]
maps each row of U𝑘to a corresponding row in Pso that the ap-
proximation of U𝑘can be constructed from Pand𝜋𝑘. Note that𝐷
is the number of vocabularies, which is much smaller thanÍ
𝑘𝑁𝑘.
Suppose U𝑘(𝑖,:)is mapped to P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖),:). Then, we can represent
the approximation of X𝑘(𝑖1,𝑖2)as follows:
X𝑘(𝑖1,𝑖2)≈˜X𝑘(𝑖1,𝑖2)=𝑅∑︁
𝑟=1P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖1),𝑟)S(𝑘,𝑟)V(𝑖2,𝑟). (2)
Fig. 3 shows an example of the vocabulary-based approximation
of Light-IT. Thanks to Pand{𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1for the first mode, the com-
pressed outputs can be significantly smaller than the outputs of
PARAFAC2 decomposition. The compression result of Light-IT isP,S,V,{𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1	where V∈R𝑀×𝑅andS∈R𝐾×𝑅are the fac-
tor matrices for the second and final modes, respectively. We use
Huffman encoding to compress the integers in {𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1. Refer to
Theorem 1 for the analysis of the size of the compressed result.
Next, we explain the optimization process of Light-IT with its
loss function. The overall training process is described in Algo-
rithm 1. Inspired by the general vocabulary learning technique [ 5],
we design a learning process for the vocabulary-based compression.
Specifically, we co-train the temporary factor matrices {U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1that
aims to guide the training of P, and obtain{𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1from{U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1
andPwhenever they are updated. When the training phase is com-
pleted, we discard the temporary matrices {U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1. We define themapping function 𝜋𝑘as follows:
𝜋𝑘(𝑖):=argmin
𝑗∥U𝑘(𝑖,:)−P(𝑗,:)∥2
𝐹. (3)
Derived from Eq. (2), the optimization problem of Light-IT is repre-
sented as follows:
min
Θ𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝑁𝑘∑︁
𝑖=1∥X𝑘(𝑖,:)−P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖),:) V⊙S(𝑘,:)⊺∥2
𝐹, (4)
where Θ=
P,{U𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1,V,S	
. However, Eq. (4) is not differentiable
because it involves discrete functions such as the indexing operation
inP(𝜋𝑘(𝑖),:)and the argmin function in Eq. (3). To employ gradient
descents, we use the P′
𝑘(𝑖,:)in place of P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖),:)in Eq. (4), where
P′
𝑘(𝑖,:)is defined as follows:
P′
𝑘(𝑖,:)=U𝑘(𝑖,:)−𝑠𝑔(U𝑘(𝑖,:)−P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖),:)), (5)
where𝑠𝑔(·)is the stop gradient operator which is an identity func-
tion in the forward pass but drops the gradient for the input during
the backward pass. Thus, P′
𝑘(𝑖,:)becomes P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖),:)in the for-
ward pass but only backpropagates to U𝑘(𝑖,:), computing gradi-
ents for U𝑘. Additionally, we add a regularization term denoted by
∥P(𝑠𝑔(𝜋𝑘(𝑖)),:)−𝑠𝑔(U𝑘(𝑖,:))∥2
𝐹into the loss in order to update the
vocabulary matrix P. To sum up, the loss function Lfor Light-IT is
L=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1
∥X𝑘−P′
𝑘(V⊙S(𝑘,:))⊺∥2
𝐹+∥P𝑘−𝑠𝑔(U𝑘)∥2
𝐹
, (6)
where the𝑖-th row of P𝑘isP(𝑠𝑔(𝜋𝑘(𝑖)),:), and P′
𝑘(V⊙S(𝑘,:))⊺
is the reconstruction result ˜X𝑘. Light-IT optimizes its parameters
through gradient descent, minimizing the loss in Eq. (6). Note that
under the vocabulary learning mechanism [ 5], the matrices U𝑘
andPare updated at the same time by a gradient descent, and
the mapping function 𝜋𝑘is determined by them to minimize the
difference (loss function in Eq. (3)) between U𝑘andP𝑘.
Handling sparse irregular tensors: The time required to com-
pute Eq. (6), which is the main bottleneck of Light-IT, is propor-
tional to the number of entries in {X𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1becauseÍ
𝑘∥X𝑘−˜X𝑘∥2
𝐹
measures the approximation error for all entries, where ˜X𝑘=
P′
𝑘(V⊙S(𝑘,:))⊺. However, for a sparse irregular tensor, it can
be time-consuming to compute an error X𝑘(𝑖,𝑗)−˜X𝑘(𝑖,𝑗)2for
every zero entry as most of the entries that exist of the sparse
tensor are zero. Thus, we propose a sparse design that efficiently
computes the loss in Eq. (6). For this, we first carefully reorganize
the computations inÍ
𝑘∥X𝑘−˜X𝑘∥2
𝐹. The approximation error of
each sparse slice X𝑘is as follows:

sidering this, we analyze the time complexity of Light-IT for sparse
irregular tensors in Theorem 4 in Section 5.4.
Handling higher-order irregular tensors: To handle an irregu-
lar tensor{X𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1with an order 𝑑higher than three, we matricize
each sliceX𝑘and its approximation ˜X𝑘along the first mode into
X(1)
𝑘and˜X(1)
𝑘, respectively. We then use the loss in Eq. (6)with the
mode-1 matricizations to update the parameters. As the order 𝑑is
higher, we have more order-related factor matrices {V𝑖}𝑑−2
𝑖=1, and
each entry of the slice X𝑘is approximated as follows:
X𝑘(𝑖1,···,𝑖𝑑−1)≈𝑅∑︁
𝑟=1P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖1),𝑟)V1(𝑖2,𝑟)··· V𝑑−2(𝑖𝑑−1,𝑟)S(𝑘,𝑟).(10)
Then, we replace the terms in Eq. (6)as follows: X𝑘←X(1)
𝑘and
˜X𝑘←˜X(1)
𝑘=P′
𝑘 (⊙𝑑−2
𝑖=1V𝑖)⊙S(𝑘,:)⊺, which enables Light-IT
to handle higher-order irregular tensors. For the sparse design,
we replace V(:,𝑟1)⊺V(:,𝑟2)withÎ𝑑−2
𝑖=1V𝑖(:,𝑟1)⊺V𝑖(:,𝑟2)in Eq. (8).
Refer to the full equations for this in Appendix B.1.
5.3 Light-IT++: Extension with Core Tensor
We propose Light-IT++, an expressive irregular tensor decompo-
sition that achieves higher accuracy than Light-IT with little ad-
ditional space. In Eq. (2), the PARAFAC2-based computation has
limited expressiveness since it fails to capture relationships across
multiple latent dimensions; for example, there is no multiplica-
tion between P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖1),𝑟1),V(𝑖2,𝑟2), and S(𝑘,𝑟 3)(𝑟1≠𝑟2≠𝑟3). To
increase the expression power, our idea is to incorporate a core
tensorG∈R𝑅×𝑅×𝑅into the compressed outputs and employ an
approximation method used in Tucker decomposition. As a result,
the approximation formula becomes as follows:
X𝑘(𝑖,𝑗)≈𝑅∑︁
𝑟1=1𝑅∑︁
𝑟2=1𝑅∑︁
𝑟3=1G(𝑟1,𝑟2,𝑟3)P(𝜋𝑘(𝑖1),𝑟1)V(𝑗,𝑟2)S(𝑘,𝑟3).(11)
1We use the process of earning Q𝑘in PARAFAC2-ALS illustrated in [ 28] for the faster
training of the algorithm. After computing Q𝑘, we set A𝑘toQ𝑘Hwhere His sampled
randomly form [0, 1). It allows A⊺
𝑘A𝑘to be H⊺Hfor all𝑘in[𝐾], helping Light-IT share
the first mode factor matrices along the slices.

Note that ifGis a diagonal tensor whose diagonal entries are all 1,
Eq. (11) is equivalent to Eq. (2). Thus, all irregular tensors generated
by Light-IT can be generated by Light-IT++of the same rank. Light-
IT++can fit an irregular tensor with a more complex pattern by
learning the relationships between the latent dimensions (columns)
ofP𝑘,V, and Sin the form ofG. The approximation process of
Light-IT++is illustrated in Fig. 4.
The optimization process for Light-IT++is described in Algo-
rithm 2. We use the loss function as the sum of the squared errors
between the input values and their approximations in Eq. (11) (see
Appendix B.2 for the detailed equation). In the training phase of
Light-IT++, we initialize the factor matrices P,V, and Sto the cor-
responding outputs of Light-IT. The core tensor Gis initialized
to a diagonal tensor whose diagonal entries are all one, and the
mappings{𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1from Light-IT are used without changes. To up-
date the parameters G,P,V, and S, we employ the alternating least
square (ALS) method, which alternatively optimizes each parameter
in turn while fixing the others.3

Handling sparse irregular tensors: In the aforementioned up-

ciently computing the term X⊺
𝑘(P𝑘⊗S(𝑘,:)); the other terms can
be computed efficiently in the same manner.
Computing X⊺
𝑘(P𝑘⊗S(𝑘,:))requires operations whose number is
linear in the number of entries in X𝑘. We reduce the cost to be linear
in the number of non-zeros in X𝑘by conducting computations in
units of a single entry in X𝑘. LetB𝑘denote a matrix of size 𝑀×𝑅2,

Note that B𝑘becomes X⊺

in the computation, and the time complexity becomes linear in
𝑂(𝑛𝑛𝑧(X𝑘)). Refer to Theorem 6 for the detailed time complexity.
Handling higher-order irregular tensors: For a higher-order ir-
regular tensor, an entry X𝑘(𝑖1,...,𝑖𝑑−1)is approximated as follows:

Regarding the problem formulations of Light-IT++, we matricize
the sliceX𝑘and its approximation ˜X𝑘with the decomposed results
of Light-IT++. All problems are least square problems when viewed
from the row of a factor matrix or a factor matrix perspective, and
the analytic solutions for them exist.
For example, when updating V𝑖, we matricize the slices and their
approximations along the 𝑖-th mode, and formulate the problem on
V𝑖as follows:

up to 37× smaller than that of the most compact baseline, showing a similar fitenss. Light-IT++shows up to 5× higher fitness
than the most accurate baseline while providing smaller compressed outputs. Note that within each plot, data points closer to
the upper left corner indicate better trade-offs between compressed sizes and fitness.

rank of our method to 𝑅and the size of the vocabulary to 𝐷. The
number of non-zero entries in X𝑘is denoted by 𝑛𝑛𝑧(X𝑘). Proofs of
all theorems are available in Section 2 of Online Appendix [23].
Size of compressed outputs: The compressed output sizes of our
methods are described in Theorems 1 and 2. It is worth noting that
the output size 𝑂(log𝐷Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝑁𝑘)of Huffman encoding is empir-
ically much smaller than the size 𝑂(Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝑁𝑘𝑅)of the first mode
factor matrices in PARAFAC2 decomposition.

size of Light-IT++is𝑂(𝑅(𝐷+Í𝑑−2

Compression time: We analyze the time for a single epoch of
Light-IT and Light-IT++. Note that there are terms that include the
number of entries (i.e.Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝑁𝐾Î𝑑−2
𝑖=1𝑀𝑖) in the complexities of the
methods for dense irregular tensors and the terms that include the

of the methods for spares irregular tensors.

compress an irreuglar tensor in terms of compression speed?
Q5.Vocabulary Size: What is the optimal size of the vocabulary?
Our answer to Q5 can be found in Section 3 of Online Appendix [ 23].
6.1 Experimental Specifications
Machines: All experiments except the ablation study and scalabil-
ity test were conducted on a workstation having an RTX 3090Ti
GPU and 128GB RAM. Our methods for the ablation study and
scalability test in Sections 6.3 and 6.4 were executed on a machine
with an RTX 2080Ti GPU and 128GB RAM. The competitors that
do not require a GPU were executed on a machine with an i5-9600K
(6 cores) and 64GB RAM. The accuracies and compression ratios of
the methods are independent of the machine’s specifications.
Competitors: We use 8 state-of-the-art methods for irregular ten-
sor decomposition as our competitors. PARAFAC2-ALS [ 19], RD-
ALS [ 6], DPar25[16], and HyTuck26[4] are targeting at 3-order
dense irregular tensors; and COPA7[1], SPARTan8[28], and RE-
PAIR9[29] are tailored for 3-order sparse irregular tensors. BTD2 [ 3]
is a method for 4-order dense irregular tensors. Refer to Section 2
for the explanations of the competitors. Since the official imple-
mentations of PARAFAC2-ALS, RD-ALS, and BTD2 have not been
released, we implemented them ourselves. For the other competi-
tors, we used the open-sourced implementations provided by the
authors. All of them were implemented in MATLAB R2020a.

Datasets: We used 6 public real-world datasets whose statistics are
summarized in Table 2. Note that the datasets include sparse, dense,
and higher-order irregular tensors. Refer to Appendix C.3 for the
semantics, sources, and preprocessing steps of the datasets.
Evaluation metrics: We evaluated the accuracy of a compression
result by measuring fitness, defined as follows:
𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 =1−vut 𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1∥X𝑘−¯X𝑘∥2
𝐹!
/𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1∥X𝑘∥2
𝐹,
where ¯X𝑘is the approximation of a given X𝑘by a compression
method, and it is tailored for measuring the accuracy of irregular
tensor compression, extending from the fitness applied to regular
tensors. The concept of fitness has been widely used for measuring
the accuracy of tensor approximation (or compression) [ 20,27]. It
is at most 1, with higher fitness indicating more accurate compres-
sion. The compressed size was measured by counting the number
of parameters in the compression result in bytes. Recall that we
applied Huffman encoding to compress the integer numbers in the
mappings{𝜋𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1in our methods. More details of compressed
sizes are in Appendix C.1.
Training details: Training details are provided in Appendix C.2.
6.2 Compression Performance
We evaluated the compression performances of our methods and
competitors by comparing the trade-offs between accuracy and com-
pressed size. To this end, we measured the fitness of each method by
varying the compressed size in bytes. We compared the compressed
sizes (or accuracies) of our methods with those of their competitors
at a similar level of accuracy (or size). We set the size of the vocab-
ulary of our methods to the largest mode length of the first mode
in a given irregular tensor. The values of the hyperparameters of
all methods are provided in Appendx C.4.
As shown in Fig. 5, Light-IT and Light-IT++significantly out-
perform their competitors by providing the best trade-off between
accuracy and size. Specifically, the compressed size of Light-IT++is
36.55×smaller than that of the most compact baseline, showing a
similar approximation accuracy in the Korea-stock dataset. In the
CMSdataset, Light-IT++shows 5.02×higher fitness than the most

accurate baseline. Note that the maximum settings of our methods
yield much smaller compressed sizes than the minimum settings of
the other methods. As expected, Light-IT++achieves higher accu-
racy than Light-IT, albeit at the cost of slightly more compressed
size in most datasets. Note that no competitor can be run on the
Enron andDelicious datasets since they form 4-dimensional ir-
regular tensors, respectively. The experiments on REPAIR ran out
of memory in all 3-order tensors, except for MIMIC-III . Out-of-
memory issues occurred when running BTD2 on 4-order tensors.
Thus, in Section 1 of Online Appendix [ 23], we sampled the indices
of the original tensors, made them into small tensors, and compared
the performances of our methods and BTD2.
6.3 Ablation Studies
We compared Light-IT and Light-IT++with the following methods
to check the effectiveness of our ideas:
•Light-IT-L: a variant of Light-IT that directly maps the 𝑖-th row in
a slice to the 𝑖-th row of the vocabulary matrix without learning
the mapping functions.
•CP and Tucker: CP and Tucker decompositions of the regular
tensor obtained by zero-padding the input irregular tensor.
•Light-IT and Light-IT++for ST: sparse versions of our methods,
leveraging sparsity for irregular sparse tensors (ST).
We used the same rank for all methods, and refer to Appendix C.5
for more details. Note that out-of-memory issues occurred when
running Tucker decomposition on the CMSdataset.
Vocabulary-based compression: Despite being under the same
vocabulary-based scheme, Light-IT-L performs worse than Light-
IT, as shown in Fig. 6, indicating it is crucial to accurately learn the
mappings, achieved by our approach. In addition, Light-IT (or Light-
IT++) outperforms CP (resp., Tucker), implying the effectiveness
of the vocabulary-based compression over the decompositions of
zero-padded regular tensors.
Extension with core tensor: As Light-IT++outperforms Light-
IT at the same rank, our extension with the core tensor provides
enhanced expressiveness for compression.
Sparse design: As shown in Fig. 7, the compression time required
by both Light-IT and Light-IT++decreases when using the sparse
versions instead of their dense versions. The difference is distinct
in the Enron and Delicious datasets, which are much sparser
than the others, indicating that leveraging the sparsity plays an
important role in the efficient compression of sparse tensors.

)linearly to the number of non-zero entries or entries.
6.4 Scalability
We investigated the scalability of Light-IT and Light-IT++, specifi-
cally the compression (training) time per epoch w.r.t. the number
of non-zero entries in sparse irregular tensors and the number of
entries in dense irregular tensors, respectively. For sparse irregular
tensors, we fixed their sizes while varying the densities by a factor
of2. For dense irregular tensors, we varied their sizes by a factor of
2. All non-zero entries were randomly sampled from [0,1). More
details on sizes and densities are provided in Appendix C.6.
Our methods exhibit near-linear scalability with the number of
non-zero entries in sparse irregular tensors, as shown in Fig. 8(a)
and 8(c), aligning with the analysis in Theorems 4 and 6 where
it asymptotically dominates the other terms. For dense irregular
tensors, as shown in Fig. 8(b) and 8(d), the compression time of our
methods increases sub-linearly with the number of entries, in line
with the analysis presented in Theorems 3 and 5.
6.5 Total Compression Time
We evaluated the total compression time of all methods on each
dataset under parameter settings that yield similar accuracy (refer
to Appendix C.7 for details). As shown in Fig. 9, our methods require
more time than the competitors for compressing 3-order irregular
tensors, except for MIMIC-III . The main cause is the learning of
mappings, and while it slows down our methods, it is worthwhile
for effectively compressing irregular tensors. Remark that out-of-
memory issues occurred when running BTD2. Another observation
is that Light-IT++spends little more time than Light-IT, but recall
that Light-IT++achieves higher accuracy in return.
7 CONCLUSION
This paper presents Light-IT and Light-IT++, novel decomposition
methods for an irregular tensor, specialized for lossy compression.
In Light-IT, we introduced a vocabulary matrix for reducing the
size of the first mode factor matrices of PARAFAC2 decomposition.

We also devised Light-IT++, which includes a Tucker operation for
enhancing the accuracy. For the same rank, Light-IT is faster, but
Light-IT++is more accurate with a small increase in the number
of parameters. With these contributions, our methods have the
following advantages:
•Compact: The compressed output of our methods is up to 37 ×
smaller than that of the most compact baseline, providing a simi-
lar approximation error.
•Accurate: Our method with a smaller compressed output offers
up to 5× better fitness than the most accurate baseline.
•Versatile: Our methods exploit the sparsity of sparse irregular
tensors for reducing the compression time. Furthermore, they
successfully compress irregular tensors of any order.
Reproducibility: The
code and datasets are available at [23].

A matricization of a tensor X∈R𝑁1×𝑁2×···×𝑁𝑑is defined as follows.
Let the ordered sets R={𝑟1,···,𝑟𝐿}andC={𝑐1,···,𝑐𝑀}be a par-
titioning of the modes D={1,···,𝑑}. The mode- 𝑟1,···,𝑟𝐿mati-

𝑟∈R𝑁𝑟×Î

A.2 Kronecker Product and Khatri-rao Product
Kronecker product: Given two matrices A∈R𝐼×𝐽andB∈R𝐾×𝐿,
the matrix C∈R𝐼𝐾×𝐽𝐿is the result of Kronecker product between
AandB, defined as follows:

Khatri-rao product: Khatri-rao product is a column-wise Kro-
necker product. Given two matrices A∈R𝐼×𝐽andB∈R𝐾×𝐽
which have the same column size, the Khatri-rao product produces
the matrix C∈R𝐼𝐾×𝐽:
C=A⊙B=A(:,1)⊗B(:,1) ··· A(:,𝐽)⊗B(:,𝐽)

where A(:,𝑗)andB(:,𝑗)are the𝑗-th column vectors of AandB,
respectively.

C SUPPLEMENTS FOR EXPERIMENTS
C.1 Metrics for Compressed Sizes
All methods, except COPA, saved their resulting matrices or tensors
in a dense format. For COPA, we chose either a sparse format (i.e.,
COO) or a dense format, selecting the one with minimal space cost
for saving each of the outputs. For the sparse format, we further
compressed integer indices using Huffman encoding.
C.2 Training Details
When training Light-IT, we used 500 epochs for all datasets. We
measured the fitness of Light-IT every 10 epochs and reported the
highest obtained fitness. We tuned the learning rate for Light-IT
by varying it in {1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001}. As a result, the learning rate
of Light-IT is set to 10−2except in US-stock . InUS-stock ,10−1is
used as the learning rate when the ranks are 4 and 8, and 10−2is
used when the ranks are 12 and 16. The initial parameters of Light-
IT++were set to the parameters of Light-IT, and the core tensor was
initialized to a diagonal tensor whose diagonal entries were all 1. We
updated the parameters of Light-IT++until the increase of fitness
is smaller than 10−4. We used the same convergence condition
for PARAFAC2-ALS. When training COPA on sparse tensors, we
imposed non-negative constraints to H,Wand a sparsity constraint
toV, following one of the scenarios outlined in the original paper.
For dense tensors, we gave non-negative constraints to all H,W,
andVsince running with sparsity constraints on Vwas failed. We
set the convergence tolerance to 10−4and the maximum number
of iterations to 1000 when executing SPARTan, as provided in the
authors’ code. The convergence tolerance was set to 10−4when
running COPA, and this was the setting provided in the authors’
code. We also set the convergence tolerance for PARAFAC2-ALS to
10−4. We set the maximum number of iterations to 32 for DPar2
and RD-ALS, as the authors of DPar2 did. We set the convergence
tolerance to 10−3and10−6for REPAIR and HyTuck2, respectively,
following the authors’ code.

from 2008 to 2010. We built a tensor to count the diagnoses that
each patient has received in the form of (visits, diagnoses, patients;
counts). We categorized the diagnosis codes into Clinical Classifi-
cation Software (CCS)11, and assumed that each claim id indicates
a unique visit. We only considered the patients who visited clinics
more than once.
MIMIC-III [18]:12MIMIC-III is an intensive care unit (ICU) dataset
collected between 2001 and 2012. The tensor we built saves the
medications that each patient has prescribed and is composed of
(dates, drugs, patients; counts). We removed the dates that didn’t
include any medications and removed patients whose lengths of
dates were less than 2. We only used 1000 types of drugs which
were most frequently prescribed.
Korea-stock, US-stock [16]:13Stock datasets are the collections
of stocks on the South Korea and US stock markets. Each dataset
is represented as a tensor of (dates, feature types, stocks; feature
values). We used the tensors preprocessed by the authors of [16].
Enron [30, 31]:14Enron stores the counts of words in emails in
the form of (dates, senders, words, receivers; counts). We only
used senders and receivers whose IDs were smaller than 1001, and
we checked the 1000 most frequently used words. We made the
irregularity in the tensor by removing the dates in each receiver
when no email had arrived.
Delicious [10, 31]:15TheDelicious dataset is a collection of tags
from the Delicious website and consists of (dates, items, tags, users;
binary indicators for tags). We sampled the most frequent items
and tags when building a tensor. We removed dates without any
tag for each user, resulting in the irregularity of the tensor.

of REPAIR to 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 in MIMIC-III . For REPAIR, we set
the number of bases to 253, following the setting in the paper.
C.5 Supplements for the Ablation Study
For the methods in Fig. 6 of Section 6.3, we set the rank to 30 in
CMSandMIMIC-III , 16 in Korea-stock andUS-stock , 15 in Enron ,
and 23 in Delicious . We tuned the learning rates of Light-IT and
Light-IT-L from{1,10−1,10−2,10−3}. The convergence tolerances
for the CP and Tucker decompositions are set to 10−4.
When conducting the experiments for Fig. 7 of Section 6.3, we
sampled the first few slices from real-world sparse tensors (1000
forCMSandMIMIC-III , 20 for Enron , and 30 for Delicious ) since
total tensors in dense formats are too large. For all datasets in Fig. 7,
we set the number of epochs of Light-IT to 500, the learning rate
of Light-IT to 10−2, rank to 10, and the convergence tolerance of
Light-IT++to10−4.
C.6 Supplments for the Scalability Test
The (minimum, maximum, average) number of rows of the 3-order
sparse irregular tensors in Section 6.4 is (2, 510, 261.71), and the
mode lengths of the remaining modes are all 512. The (minimum,
maximum, average) number of rows of the 4-order sparse irregular
tensors in Section 6.4 is (2, 126, 70.38), and the mode lengths of the
remaining modes are all 128. The densities of the sparse irregular
tensors are in Table 3. The sizes of the dense irregular tensors used
in Section 6.4 are in Table 4.
