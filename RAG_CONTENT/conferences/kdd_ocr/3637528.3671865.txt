ABSTRACT
The confluence of Federated Learning (FL) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) is ushering in a new era in privacy-preserving nat-
ural language processing. However, the intensive memory require-
ments for fine-tuning LLMs pose significant challenges, especially
when deploying on clients with limited computational resources.
To circumvent this, we explore the novel integration of Memory-
efficient Zeroth-Order Optimization within a federated setting, a
synergy we term as FedMeZO. Our study is the first to examine
the theoretical underpinnings of FedMeZO in the context of LLMs,
tackling key questions regarding the influence of large parameter
spaces on optimization behavior, the establishment of convergence
properties, and the identification of critical parameters for conver-
gence to inform personalized federated strategies. Our extensive
empirical evidence supports the theory, showing that FedMeZO not
only converges faster than traditional first-order methods such as
FedAvg but also significantly reduces GPU memory usage during
training to levels comparable to those during inference. Moreover,
the proposed personalized FL strategy that is built upon the theoreti-
cal insights to customize the client-wise learning rate can effectively
accelerate loss reduction. We hope our work can help to bridge
theoretical and practical aspects of federated fine-tuning for LLMs,
thereby stimulating further advancements and research in this area.

1 INTRODUCTION
Federated Learning (FL) has become an important approach in
modern machine learning, particularly in scenarios where data
decentralization and privacy-preserving are crucial [ 28,42,43,56,
58]. Central to this learning paradigm is the corroborative training
of a global model through the aggregation of updates from multiple
clients, without sharing their raw data [31, 41].
In parallel, Large Language Models (LLMs) have radically ad-
vanced the field of natural language processing [ 6,17,52]. The
fine-tuning of LLMs that are already pre-trained on vast corpora,
has proven to be a highly effective strategy for numerous tasks,
yielding models that are both versatile and capable of adapting to
specific domain narratives or aligning with human values [6, 39].
The tuning of LLMs requires suitable alignment data, which are
often costly to acquire [ 11,16]. Due to the abundance of private data
that remains largely isolated and underutilized, the intersection of
FL and LLMs has sparked increasing interest among researchers
[20,32,46,61]. Notably, this integration presents significant com-
putational challenges, especially for clients with limited resources
[10,62]. The scaling up of LLMs further compounds this issue, as

the computation of gradients for backpropagation incurs substan-
tial memory costs, frequently surpassing the practical capabilities
of these clients [39].
Addressing this challenge, we turn our attention to Zeroth-Order
Optimization (ZOO), an algorithm that computes gradient approxi-
mations without explicit gradient information, thus significantly
reducing memory consumption [ 25]. However, the combination of
ZOO and FL —a research direction we refer to as ZOO-FL —remains
unexplored in the literature in the context of LLMs [ 47]. Our work
intends to bridge this gap by harnessing the memory efficiency of
ZOO within the context of federated fine-tuning of LLMs, especially
on the following theoretical foundations:
(Q1) How does the vast parameter space of LLMs influence
the behavior of ZOO-FL? (Q2) Can we establish the convergence
properties of ZOO-FL for LLMs? (Q3) Which model parameters are
critical for convergence, and how can we leverage them to optimize
FL performance, such as via personalization?
In this paper, we focus on incorporating a memory-efficient ZOO
method, MeZO [ 39] into FL, a synergy we denote as FedMeZO,
and establishing its convergence properties under the large-scale
parameter space of LLMs. We analyze and present precise conver-
gence rates characterized by the low effective rank 𝑟of the models’
Hessian matrices [ 3,33], and other typical FL parameters such as
number of clients 𝑁, number of FL rounds 𝑇, iteration steps of local
training𝐻and heterogeneity constants 𝑐ℎand𝜎ℎ. Moreover, we
reveal the learning rate to be a crucial variable for convergence.
Building on theoretical insights, we further propose a strategy that
tailors the learning rate to each client’s specific data characteristics.
To validate our theoretical results, we conduct extensive exper-
iments on real-world FL datasets for LLM tuning, which cover
diverse data distributions and application tasks. Our empirical find-
ings corroborate the theoretical analysis, validating effective conver-
gence even when scaling up to models with billions of parameters.
Compared with first-order methods such as FedAvg, FedMeZO
converges faster meanwhile remarkably reducing GPU memory
requirements. The personalized strategies guided by our theoretical
insights, empirically show a more rapid loss reduction, as opposed
to non-personalized or random learning rate assignments.
In summary, our theoretical and empirical exploration validates
FedMeZO in the fine-tuning process of LLMs, providing a rigorous
framework and practical insights for future applications. Our key
contributions are threefold:
•We advance the understanding of FedMeZO for LLMs, extending
the two-point gradient estimation to federated tuning and es-
tablishing theoretical convergence rate O

for the i.i.d. setting and

•We analyze the impact of various hyperparameters of FedMeZO
and explore a theory-informed strategy for personalized learning
rate adjustment, providing practical guidance for ZOO-FL.
•Through extensive empirical evidence with LLMs, we verify the
proposed theoretical results and show that FedMeZO yields ef-
fective convergence with substantially reduced memory over-
head compared to FedAvg. Our codes are publicly available at

2.1 Background and Related Works
Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models. Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
that enable a variety of real-world applications [ 52,64,65]. The fed-
erated fine-tuning of LLMs has recently attracted attention, focused
on adapting these models to domain-specific tasks while preserv-
ing the privacy of the training data. Chen et al. [ 8] investigated
the integration of LLMs within federated settings, highlighting the
inherent challenges and potential opportunities. Zhang et al. [ 62]
furthered this research by examining instruction tuning of LLMs
in a federated context, marking progress in applying FL to the spe-
cialized training of LLMs. Notable frameworks such as FATE-LLM
by Fan et al. [ 21] and FederatedScope-LLM by Kuang et al. [ 32]
offer industrial-grade and comprehensive solutions for federated
fine-tuning. Our work, in contrast, investigates the fusion of Zeroth-
Order Optimization (ZOO) with FL for the fine-tuning of LLMs, an
area that has yet to be fully investigated, thereby addressing a gap
in the literature and providing fundamental theoretical insights.
Zeroth-Order Optimization in Federated Learning. ZOO has
emerged as a viable method to address the difficulties of computing
gradients in FL, especially in settings limited by computational
resources. Zhang et al. [ 63] proposed a ZOO algorithm tailored for
vertical FL, focusing on privacy preservation. Yi et al. [ 60] and Li
et al. [ 34] studied ZOO-FL algorithms, with discussions on conver-
gence properties with single-point perturbation and local updates
in decentralized FL, respectively. The convergence analysis is a
critical aspect of FL, as illustrated by Li et al. [ 37] for the FedAvg
algorithm and further developed by Fang et al. [ 22] for mini-batch
stochastic ZOO-FL in wireless networks. Moreover, Shu et al. [ 50]
proposed enhancements to query efficiency for ZOO within the FL
framework. Our research sets itself apart by formulating theoret-
ical convergence bounds for ZOO-FL, specifically tailored to the
large-scale parameter space of LLMs. This builds on the preliminary
work by Malladi et al. [ 39], which confirmed the feasibility of ZOO
for LLMs in a centralized setting.
2.2 Problem Formulation
Federated Learning. We consider the general FL setting as of
FedAvg [ 41], with a central server and a collection of 𝑁clients,
indexed by 1,2,...,𝑁 . The central server coordinates the training of a
global model through the collaborative efforts of these clients, each
holding local data samples drawn from their respective distributions
D𝑖. The optimization problem can be formulated as:
min
𝜃∈R𝑑𝑓(𝜃)△=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝑓𝑖(𝜃𝑖), 𝑓𝑖(𝜃)△=EB𝑖∼D𝑖
𝐹𝑖(𝜃,B𝑖)
,(1)
where𝜃∈R𝑑denotes the 𝑑-dimension parameter of the model,
and𝑓(𝜃)and𝑓𝑖(𝜃)denote the global loss function on the central
server and local loss function on 𝑖𝑡ℎclient, respectively. Typically,
the clients are assumed with equal importance [ 54], and the data is
randomly sampled for efficiency [ 35].𝐹𝑖(𝜃,B𝑖)represents the local
loss function w.r.t a specific mini-batch B𝑖drawn fromD𝑖.

Zeroth-Order Optimization. Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO)
is a prominent technique in scenarios where gradients are difficult to
obtain, which estimates gradients by forward propagations. Given
a random vector 𝑧and a smoothing constant 𝜇, a typical one-point
gradient estimator [18] is defined as:
e∇𝐹(𝜃,𝑧,B,𝜇)=𝑧
2𝜇 𝐹(𝜃+𝜇𝑧,B)−𝐹(𝜃,B), (2)
However, Eq. (2)provides a biased gradient estimation, leading to
a certain degree of information loss [ 38]. Hence our work employs
the ZOO paradigm with a two-point gradient estimator proposed
by [39] in a federated setting:
Definition 2.1. (Two-point gradient estimator) Given a set of
parameters𝜃∈R𝑑for an LLM and a mini-batch B𝑖, the two-point
zeroth-order gradient estimator is formulated as:
e∇𝐹𝑖(𝜃,𝑧𝑖,B𝑖,𝜇)=𝑧𝑖
2𝜇 𝐹𝑖(𝜃+𝜇𝑧𝑖,B𝑖)−𝐹𝑖(𝜃−𝜇𝑧𝑖,B𝑖),(3)
where𝑧𝑖∼N( 0,𝐼𝑑)is a Gaussian random variable and 𝜇is the
perturbation scale. The two-point gradient estimator in Eq. (3)
requires only two forward passes through the model to compute
the estimation of gradient, which serves as a memory-efficient
alternative to backpropagation (BP).
The FedMeZO Algorithm. In this paper, we study and ana-
lyze the proprieties of a practical synergy of MeZO [ 39] and Fe-
dAvg [ 41], which is designed to fine-tune LLMs in an efficient,
privacy-preserving and personalized manner. We term this ZOO-FL
approach as FedMeZO, depicted with the following processes:
In a single communication round, the central server first broad-
casts the global model parameters to available clients. Once the
clients have completed their local updates and uploaded their mod-
els, the server aggregates the updates according to Eq. (1), forming
the basis for the subsequent round.
Upon receiving the global model parameters, clients perform the
following steps, distinguishing FedMeZO from traditional BP-based
FedAvg algorithms in two-fold:
(1) Training Memory Reduction: Clients update their models using
the two-point ZOO gradient estimator defined in Eq. (3) as:
𝑒(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖=e∇𝐹𝑖(𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖,𝑧(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖,B(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖,𝜇), (4)
where(𝑡,𝑘)denotes the𝑘𝑡ℎiteration within the 𝑡𝑡ℎcommunication
round. Unlike standard ZO-SGD algorithms that require storing
the perturbation vector 𝑧at each iteration, FedMeZO resamples
𝑧using random seeds in in-place implementation, thus reducing
memory usage to a level equivalent to inference [39].
(2) Communication Cost Reduction: To mitigate the high commu-
nication overhead associated with LLMs, FedMeZO leverages Low-
Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 4,29], which introduces reparametriza-
tion to tune two small delta matrix on the linear layers instead of
the whole LLM weights, based on the assumption that well pre-
trained LLM possess a low “intrinsic dimension” when adapted to
new tasks. Introducing it can help us further reduce the number
of parameters to be updated and uploaded, thereby aligning with
the practical constraints of federated settings. Detailed analysis of
communication cost is available in Appendix C.1.2.3 Lemmas and Assumptions
Lemma 2.2. (Unbiased Gradient Estimator) The two-point zeroth-
order gradient estimator described in Eq. (3)is an unbiased estimator
of the true gradient, that is,
E[e∇𝐹𝑖(𝜃,𝑧𝑖,B𝑖,𝜇)]=∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃). (5)
The Hessian matrix, which is the square matrix of second-order
partial derivatives of the loss w.r.t the model parameters, character-
izes the curvature of the loss surface [ 24]. Although the size of a
model’s loss Hessian is often associated with the rate of fine-tuning,
studies suggest that the large-scale parameters of LLMs do not
necessarily impede convergence [ 2,30]. This paradox is addressed
by recognizing that the loss Hessian often exhibits a small local
effective rank [ 39], which we capture in the following assumption:
Assumption 1. There exist a Hessian matrix H(𝜃𝑡)satisfying:
•∇2𝑓(𝜃)⪯H(𝜃𝑡)for all𝜃such that∥𝜃−𝜃𝑡∥≤𝜂𝑑𝐺(𝜃𝑡), where
𝐺(𝜃𝑡)=maxB∼D∥∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡,B)∥.
•The effective rank of H(𝜃𝑡), denoted as tr(H(𝜃𝑡))/∥H(𝜃𝑡)∥op,
is at most𝑟. Here trdenotes the trace of the matrix, and ∥·∥opdenotes
the operator norm.
Assumption 1 characterizes a low effective rank 𝑟in the Hessian
matrix, which demonstrates that LLM fine-tuning can occur in a
low dimensional subspace ( ≤200parameters) [ 3,33]. With this
insight, [ 39] identified the bound of loss descent at each step of
centralized ZOO, which is partially influenced by 𝑟:
Lemma 2.3. (Bounded Centralized Descent) Assume𝑓(𝜃)is𝐿-
smooth and let e∇𝐹(𝜃,𝑧,B,𝜇)be the unbiased zeroth-order gradient
estimator from Eq. (3). If the Hessian matrix H(𝜃)exhibits a local
effective rank of 𝑟, and constants 𝛾=Θ(𝑟/𝑛)and𝜁=Θ(1/𝑟𝑑)exist,
then the expected decrease in loss can be bounded as follows:
E
𝑓(𝜃𝑡+1)
≤𝑓(𝜃𝑡)−𝜂
𝛾∥∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)∥2
+𝜂2𝐿𝜁
2E
∥e∇𝐹(𝜃,𝑧,B,𝜇)∥2
, (6)
where𝛾=𝑑𝑟+𝑑−2
𝑛(𝑑+2),𝜁=(𝑑+2)𝑛2
(𝑑𝑟+𝑑−2)(𝑑+𝑛−1), and𝑛is the number of
randomizations.
From Eq. (6), we observe that the rate of descent at a single step
depends on the gradient related to 𝛾and the gradient estimation
related to𝜁. Following [ 39], we set𝑛to 1 in this paper. Detailed
proofs of Lemmas are available in Appendix C.1 and C.2 of our
extended version [1].
Besides, to facilitate the analysis in FL setting, we introduce four
assumptions, including Bounded Loss (Assumption 2), 𝐿-smoothness
(Assumption 3), mini-batch gradient error bound (Assumption 4),
global-local disparities in i.i.d. andnon-i.i.d. settings (Assumptions 5
and 6 respectively). These assumptions are standard in optimization
and FL literature [5, 36, 37, 55], which we detail in Appendix A.
3 MAIN RESULTS
3.1 Convergence Analysis in i.i.d. Case
In this subsection, we examine the convergence properties of Fed-
MeZO within the i.i.d. data distribution setting. We establish the
conditions under which the algorithm guarantees loss reduction at
each iteration and provide a global convergence rate.

where𝛾and𝜁quantify the effective low-rank properties of the gradi-
ent and its estimator, respectively.
In Theorem 3.1, the term (−2𝜂/𝛾)E𝑡|∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)|2serves as a critical
factor that drives the decrease in the loss function, as it is the sole
negative contributor in Eq. (8)such that E𝑡
𝑓(𝜃𝑡+1)−𝑓(𝜃𝑡)
≤0.
Note that the presence of the factor 𝛾−1=Θ(𝑟−1)underscores
the impact of the low effective rank 𝑟on the convergence rate
(under Assumption 1), revealing that a reduction in 𝑟can accelerate
convergence independently of the high-dimensional parameter
space𝑑. Consequently, even for LLMs with expansive parameter
spaces, FedMeZO can attain convergence. This addresses our first
foundational question “Q1: How does the vast parameter space of
LLMs influence the behavior of ZOO-FL? ”.
Moreover, the terms (2𝜂𝜁/𝑑)E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2and(2𝜎2𝑔𝜁𝜂𝐿/𝑁𝐻𝑑)
are scaled by 𝜁/𝑑,i.e., in Θ(1/𝑟𝑑2), contributing a relatively smaller
effect on the convergence speed compared to negative term. This
demonstrates that the influence on convergence speed from the
zeroth-order gradient estimation is moderated by the model’s effec-
tive low rank and dimensionality. As for the last term, (𝜁𝜂𝜇2𝐿3/2𝑁𝐻),
it acts as a factor slowing down the convergence rate, and we can
observe that when 𝑁and𝐻are larger, this term becomes smaller.
This suggests that the effect of slowing down the convergence rate
is not as pronounced, and simultaneously, the perturbation step 𝜇
should not be excessively large. Specifically, this term indicates that
increasing the number of clients and the number of local rounds
can enhance convergence, while also emphasizing the importance
of keeping the perturbation step 𝜇moderate.
After gaining intuitive insights in each round of training through
the analysis of Theorem 3.1, it is necessary to assess the convergence
performance of FedMeZO from a global perspective. We utilize the
squared magnitude of the gradient E𝑡∥∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)∥2as a measure to
assess the suboptimality of each iterate. The rapidity with which
the algorithm approaches a stationary point serves as a crucial
metric for determining its efficacy in the context of non-convex
optimization problems [44].
Corollary 3.2. (Global Convergence in i.i.d. Setting) Assum-
ing the conditions of Theorem 3.1 hold, the global convergence for
FedMeZO in the i.i.d. case, characterized by Γ=𝑑−𝜁𝛾
𝑑𝛾, is given by

𝑁𝐻𝑑Γ+𝜁𝜇2𝐿3
4𝑁𝐻Γ(9)
where𝑓∗denotes the optimal loss value.The upper bound on the minimum squared gradient norm across
iterations is composed of three terms in Corollary 3.2. The first term
indicates that the distance to the optimal loss relies on the initial
state of optimality, while the second and third terms elucidate the
influences of stochastic mini-batch errors and the perturbation scale
𝜇inherent to ZOO, respectively. Specifically, they both reflect the
impact of the model parameters 𝑑and the low effective rank 𝑟on
the optimal loss. As pointed out in [ 44], by choosing an appropriate
step size, we can obtain the desired accuracy.
Given that𝛾=Θ(𝑟)and𝜁=Θ

𝑑−𝜁𝛾, which
simplifies to 𝛾=Θ(𝑟). Therefore, Γ=Θ

=Θ

𝑟
. Building on
this relationship, we have the following corollary that articulates
the convergence rate of FedMeZO.
Corollary 3.3. (Convergence Rate in i.i.d. Setting) Assuming the
conditions of Corollary 3.2 hold and given 𝜂=(𝑁𝐻)1/2(𝑟𝑇)−1/2and
𝜇=(𝑁𝐻)1/4𝑟−1/2, we have
min
𝑡∈[𝑇]E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2
≤O
𝑟3/2(𝑁𝐻𝑇)−1/2
+O
𝑑−1(𝑟𝑁𝐻)−1/2
.
(10)
The expression on the right-hand side of Eq. (10)is dominated
byO
𝑟3/2(𝑁𝐻𝑇)−1/2
. Consequently, we have derived the con-
vergence rate for FedMeZO. The low effective rank 𝑟significantly
contributes to lowering the convergence rate, which is also influ-
enced by the number of clients 𝑁, the steps of local training iteration
𝐻, and the total number of communication rounds 𝑇. Moreover,
to satisfy the learning rate condition in Eq. (7), the values of 𝑁,𝐻,
and𝑇must be suitably large.
It is important to note that FedMeZO does not primarily aim to
accelerate convergence speed but rather to identify the convergence
rate under assumptions pertinent to LLMs. This is intended to
demonstrate that FedMeZO can achieve convergence even within
a vast parameter space. In a series of studies on federated ZOO,
Federated Zeroth-Order Optimization (FedZO) presents the most
comprehensive and complete analysis with a convergence rate of
O√︁
𝑑/(𝑁𝐻𝑇𝑏 1𝑏2)
[22], which exhibits a lower rate compared
toO 𝑑3/𝑇of ZONE-S [ 26] and accounts for the impact of 𝐻
compared toO√︁
𝑑/𝑁𝑇
of DZOPA [ 60]. In contrast to FedZO, our
method, FedMeZO, theoretically supports a faster convergence by
replacing𝑑1/2with𝑟3/2and setting𝑏1=𝑏2=1. These comparisons
show that FedMeZO addresses the challenges posed by large models,
offering an efficient convergence rate that relies on 𝑟.
This advancement signifies progress in optimizing federated
learning algorithms, particularly for LLMs, where the scalability
of parameters and data heterogeneity are major challenges. By
emphasizing the low effective rank, our approach enhances both
the theoretical understanding of convergence behavior in complex
settings and the guidance insights into the settings of learning rates
and other parameters to achieve efficient convergence outcomes.
However, i.i.d. data is typically encountered in idealized envi-
ronments. In real-world applications, non-i.i.d. conditions are more

common and challenging. Next, we further discuss and analyze the
convergence of FedMeZO under non-i.i.d. settings.
3.2 Convergence Analysis in Non-i.i.d Case
Analyzing convergence in the context of non-i.i.d. data distributions
is crucial for understanding the behavior of FL algorithms in real-
world scenarios. In this section, we extend our convergence analysis
to the case where client data distributions are heterogeneous.
Theorem 3.4. (Stepwise Loss Descent in Non-i.i.d Setting) Let
Assumptions 1-4 and Assumption 6 hold and learning rate 𝜂satisfy
𝜂≤minn1

Then, the expected loss at each step for FedMeZO in the non-i.i.d.

wheree𝑐ℎ=𝑐ℎ+𝑁ande𝜎2=3𝑐𝑔𝜎2
ℎ+𝜎2𝑔.
Comparing Eq. (12)with its i.i.d. counterpart Eq. (8), the non-i.i.d.
setting introduces additional terms reflecting data heterogeneity.
Firstly, an additional term e𝑐ℎappears before E𝑡∥∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)∥2; secondly,
the original 𝜎2𝑔change into e𝜎2; thirdly, a new term related to 𝜎2
ℎ
is added at the end. The term e𝑐ℎamplifies the effect of the gradi-
ent norm, while e𝜎2encapsulates both the intrinsic stochasticity
and data heterogeneity. The presence of 𝜎2
ℎindicates the impact
of client data divergence on the convergence behavior, in a degree
dependent on Θ(1/𝑟𝑑2). Given that the contribution of the negative
term accelerates the rate of decline in each round, it can be con-
cluded that heterogeneity is positively correlated with convergence.
Considering all the above changes, appropriate heterogeneity can
aid in the model convergence.
Experimental results in Section 5.3.3 confirm that a more random-
ized dataset distribution leads to improved convergence, supporting
our theoretical insights. Next, we present the global convergence
result for the non-i.i.d. setting building upon Theorem 3.4.

as in the non-i.i.d. case. Compared to Corollary
3.2, Corollary 3.5 introduces two changes: first, all terms on the
right side of Eq. 13 include a denominator 𝑐𝑔, and second, there is
an additional term associated with non-i.i.d. heterogeneity, scaledwithΘ(𝜎2
ℎ/𝑐ℎ𝑁). This further demonstrates the constraining ef-
fect of data heterogeneity in FedMeZO. Similar to Corollary 3.3,
by setting appropriate values for 𝜂and𝜇, we obtain the following
convergence rate.
Corollary 3.6. (Convergence Rate in Non-i.i.d. Setting) Assum-
ing the conditions of Corollary 3.5 hold, with 𝜂=(𝑁𝐻)1/2(𝑟e𝑐ℎ𝑇)−1/2
and𝜇=(e𝑐ℎ𝑁𝐻)1/4𝑟−1/2, FedMeZO has convergence rate as follows:

, indicating that optimizing the balance be-

term need to increase at the same time. Conse-
quently, the balance between 𝑐𝑔,𝑐ℎ, and𝑁becomes a dynamic
trade-off process, i.e., the heterogeneity among different clients
directly influences the overall convergence performance.
For now, we have answered the question “Q2: Can we establish
the convergence properties of ZOO-FL for LLMs? ” via theorems and
corollaries mentioned in this section. We also validated the nature of
convergence under different scenarios and tasks through empirical
experiments in Section 5.2.
3.3 Implications
The aforementioned theoretical results offer numerous insights into
parameter tuning. A critical revelation from our analysis pertains
to the constraints imposed on the learning rate, as delineated in
Eq.(7)and Eq. (11), which suggests that an optimal learning rate
magnitude is anchored at 1/√
𝑑. Larger learning rates are not only
ineffectual but also pose a risk of destabilizing the training dynamic.
In Appendix C.3, our empirical experiments corroborate this hy-
pothesis, demonstrating that excessive learning rates precipitate
abrupt increases in loss.
Furthermore, our insights regarding the learning rate open up
prospects for personalized FL, a compelling approach that uses
client-specific configurations to address heterogeneity and has at-
tracted increasing interest [ 9,12,19,40,49]. Specifically, we inves-
tigate theory-guided personalized strategies by dynamically adjust-
ing the learning rate 𝜂𝑖in proportion to a quantifiable measure
of data heterogeneity among clients. In light of Theorem 3.4 that
a larger heterogeneity is more conducive to model convergence,
it is feasible to appropriately increase the learning rate, allowing
specific clients to contribute more to the overall convergence, we
propose the following tailored adjustment strategy:
Proposition 3.7. (Adaptive Learning Rate Adjustment) Let As-
sumption 6 hold, the learning rate 𝜂𝑖can be adjusted according to the
formula to better accommodate the varied learning landscapes than
non-personalized FL:
𝜂𝑖=𝜂0(1+𝛼·Φ𝑖), (15)
 
1831KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhenqing Ling, Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li, & Ying Shen
where𝜂0represents a default learning rate applicable in a i.i.d.
setting,𝛼is a scaling factor that determines the sensitivity of the
learning rate and Φ𝑖is the heterogeneity index, representing the
extent of𝑐𝑔and𝜎2
ℎ. This proposition underscores the importance
of considering data heterogeneity in the design of the learning rate
strategy within personalized FL, offering a structured approach to
enhance learning outcomes across diverse client datasets.
In Section 5.4, we empirically confirm that a particular implemen-
tation of this strategy facilitates faster convergence. It is important
to note that the data heterogeneity index Φ𝑖cannot be determined
a priori; therefore, we utilize several proxy measures during the
training process to estimate it. Our goal is not to prescribe an exact
solution to this strategy, but rather, through analysis and empirical
investigation, to enlighten further research and development of
personalized FedMeZO for more effective training of LLMs.
These discussions and corresponding empirical support address
the question “Q3: Which model parameters are critical for conver-
gence, and how can we leverage them to optimize FL performance,
such as via personalization? ”.
Besides, recall that we adopt LoRA to mitigate the communi-
cation burden associated with LLMs for practical FL scenarios.
Nonetheless, the influence of LoRA on the model’s low effective
rank, remains an open question. We thus advance the following con-
jecture under Assumption 1, predicated on existing literature[ 48,
59], to facilitate further validations:
Conjecture 3.8 (Rank Correlation). The optimal reparametriza-
tion rank𝑟LoRA used in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is positively
proportional to the effective rank 𝑟of the Hessian matrix H(𝜃𝑡)of
the tuned LLM. The 𝑟LoRA is lower-bounded by 𝑟, and can serve as an
empirical proxy for 𝑟.
4 PROOF OUTLINE
This section provides an outline of the derivations presented in
Section 3, emphasizing the key analytical techniques and concepts
employed. Detailed proofs are available in Appendix D of [1].
We begin by taking expectations on both sides of Eq. (6), consid-
ering a federated learning setting. The equation is split into two
main parts for further analysis:
E𝑡
𝑓(𝜃𝑡+1)
≤𝑓(𝜃𝑡)−1

. (16)
For simplicity, we denote the two expectation terms as 𝑇1and𝑇2,
which pertain to the expected squared norms of the gradient and
the zeroth-order gradient estimator, respectively.
4.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1
For term𝑇1in Eq. (16), we utilize the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
∥𝑎+𝑏∥2≤2∥𝑎∥2+2∥𝑏∥2to decompose it into two parts, with
the first representing the discrepancy between local and global
gradients. By invoking Assumption 5, we establish:
𝑇1≤2
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1E𝑡∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃𝑡)−∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2
+2·E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2.For term𝑇2, Jensen’s inequality allows us to bound the expected
squared norm of the zeroth-order gradient estimator as follows:
𝑇2≤1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝐻∑︁
𝑘=1E𝑡𝑒(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖2
. (17)
By substituting Eq. (3)into Eq. (17), we proceed to use the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to decompose this gradient estimator
into two parts, each of which is a biased estimator. Recall that in our
gradient estimator, 𝑧𝑖follows a Gaussian distribution. Therefore,
the impact on the norm caused by a forward step and a backward
step of the estimator is identical. Consequently, we ascertain that
the term𝑇2is bounded by a single-point gradient estimation as

.
Following Lemma 4.1 in [ 23], we can bound the expectation term
as:

,(18)
where the second inequality is derived based on Assumption 4. Sub-
sequently, we bound the expectation term by applying the Cauchy-
Schwartz inequality to divide it into three parts:
E𝑡∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖)2
=E𝑡∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)

𝑖)2
≤3𝐿2E𝑡𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖−𝜃𝑡2
+3E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2
.(19)
The first part represents the gradient difference between stages
(𝑡,𝑘)and(𝑡,0), which can be computed using Assumption 3, i.e.,
the𝐿-smooth condition. The second part signifies the disparity
between local and global aspects, calculated using Assumption 5.
The third part is retained as is.
Combining Equations (17),(18)and(19), we bound𝑇2as follow:
𝑇2≤6𝑐𝑔𝐿2
𝑁𝑑𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝐻∑︁

𝑑+𝜇2𝐻𝐿2
2. (20)
Next, combining Equations (16), (17) and (20), we have:

4. (21)
In Eq. (21),E𝑡𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖−𝜃𝑡2
remains unknown and we need to
constrain it further. The key idea is to transform this expectation
term into a form related to E𝑘
𝑡∥𝑒(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖∥2and then utilize the con-
clusion of Eq. (18)and Eq. (19)for computation, we can have the

6.
Finally, by substituting Eq. (22)into Eq. (21), we obtain the fi-
nal result of the stepwise descent. After simplifying and appropri-
ately setting the learning rate, we arrive at the result presented in
Theorem 3.1. The detailed derivation of this result is provided in
Appendix D.1 of [1].
4.2 Proof of Theorem 3.4
The proof for the non-i.i.d. case follows a similar structure to that of
thei.i.d. case, with adjustments made for the heterogeneity between
local and global models as captured by 𝑐ℎand𝜎2
ℎ(Assumption 6).
In particular, we redefine 𝑇1in Eq. (16)ase𝑇1to reflect the increased
variance due to non-i.i.d. data:
e𝑇1≤2
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1E𝑡∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃𝑡)−∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2
+2E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2
≤2(1+𝑐ℎ)E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2+2𝜎2
ℎ, (23)
where the second inequality follows Assumption 6.
Subsequently, e𝑇2is computed similarly, with the heterogeneity
terms incorporated. The difference from the i.i.d. case lies in the
bounding of expectation term in Eq. (19):
E𝑡∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖)2
≤3𝐿2E𝑡𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)
𝑖−𝜃𝑡2
+3(𝑐ℎ+1)E𝑡∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)2
+3𝜎2
ℎ, (24)
where the inequality employs Assumption 6.
Combining Equations (17),(18)and(24), we bound e𝑇2as follow:
e𝑇2≤6𝑐𝑔𝐿2
𝑁𝑑𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝐻∑︁
𝑘=1E𝑡𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)

𝑑+2𝐻𝜎2𝑔
𝑑+𝜇2𝐻𝐿2
2. (25)
By substituting e𝑇1in Eq. (23)ande𝑇2in Eq. (25)into Eq. (16), we
get the result under the non-i.i.d. condition as follow:
E𝑡
𝑓(𝜃𝑡+1)
−𝑓(𝜃𝑡)≤

𝛾𝜎2
ℎ𝜂, (26)
wheree𝑐ℎdenotes(𝑐ℎ+1)ande𝜎2denotes(3𝑐𝑔𝜎2
ℎ+𝜎2𝑔). We then
need to make the expectation term bounded. Unlike Eq. (22), due to
the variations introduced by Eq. (24), two additional terms relatedtoe𝑐ℎande𝜎2emerge, yielding the following result:
1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝐻∑︁
𝑘=1E𝑡𝜃(𝑡,𝑘)

Finally, we can substitute Eq. (27)into Eq. (26)and have the
result of Theorem 3.4. The detailed derivations about these steps of
Theorem 3.4 are provided in Appendix D.3 of [1].
5 EMPIRICAL SUPPORT
This section aims to empirically validate our theoretical findings
through a series of experiments.
5.1 Experimental Setup
We utilize LLaMA-3B [ 52] as the foundational model and employ
four datasets covering a range of tasks and data distribution types
to provide comprehensive validation of our theoretical results [ 32].
Given that our theory centers on the loss function, we primarily
focus on analyzing loss descent in our experiments. More details of
the used datasets are in the Appendix (Table 2).
We set the total number of communication rounds to 500. By
default, BP-based baselines undertake local training for one epoch,
whereas FedMeZO conducts local training for 30 steps. We repeat
our experiments with three seeds and plot the error bars. For more
detailed implementation specifics, please refer to Appendix B.
5.2 Convergence Study
To assess the convergence of FedMeZO, we perform experiments on
three datasets using different data splitters, as specified in Table 2,
with test loss serving as the convergence metric. Our objective is to
evaluate the generalization and stability of FedMeZO across diverse
datasets and heterogeneity scenarios. For benchmarking purposes,
we also measure the performance of BP-based FedAvg on the same
datasets. Additionally, we document the GPU memory usage during
training in Table 1. Representative findings are illustrated in Figure
1, while the comprehensive results are available in Appendix F.11
of [1] due to the space limitation.

Figure 1: Convergence comparison of FedMeZO and BP-based

Two main conclusions emerge from the convergence experi-

Theorem 3.4, FedMeZO consistently diminishes loss with each step,
ultimately achieving stable convergence. Second, under equiva-
lent learning rate configurations, FedMeZO decreases loss more
rapidly than BP-based FedAvg, indicating a swifter convergence
rate. For instance, in the Dolly-Meta figure, FedMeZO stabilizes
and converges around 300 rounds, whereas BP-based FedAvg’s loss
is still declining at this juncture. Notably, from Table 1, we observe
that the GPU memory demand for FedMeZO is roughly one-half of
that required by BP-based FedAvg, suggesting that FedMeZO can
achieve a speedier convergence with fewer resources.
5.3 Hyper-parameters Study
In this subsection, we perform a series of experiments to ascertain
the influence of various hyper-parameters, as intimated by our
theoretical findings.
5.3.1 Impact of Perturbation Scale 𝜇.To corroborate the theoretical
impacts of the perturbation step on convergence, we examine 𝜇
values of 5×10−3and2×10−4, in addition to the default 𝜇=
1×10−3. We leverage the same datasets and splitters as in Section
5.2 for robustness. Figure 2 shows representative outcomes, with

Figure 2: Effects of different perturbation scales 𝜇.
The results confirm that, consistent with Equations (10)and(14),
a smaller𝜇marginally expedites model convergence. Figure 2 exem-
plifies that the training trajectory with 𝜇=2×10−4descends more
rapidly than the others. However, given that 𝜇appears as a second-
order term in𝜁𝜇2𝐿3
4eΓe𝑐ℎ𝑁𝐻and its absolute value is relatively small, its
overall influence is modest. This is evident in Figure 2, where mod-
ifications to 𝜇within a specific range yield only slight variations.
Thus, a smaller 𝜇proves advantageous for model convergence.

and splitters from Section 5.2, we present typical findings in Figure
3, with all the detailed results forthcoming in Appendix F.10 of [ 1].
These experimental results suggest that a lower 𝐻engenders a
more sluggish convergence pace, whereas a higher 𝐻somewhat
propels convergence, mirroring the impact of 𝐻as a denominator in
the theoretical convergence rate analysis. Nonetheless, an excessive
𝐻may lead to instability, as depicted by the curve of 𝐻=50, which
exhibits a surge endwise in the figure. Hence, an appropriate choice
of𝐻facilitates efficient model convergence.
5.3.3 Analysis of Other Hyper-parameters. We also explore the
ramifications of learning rate, data splitters, the number of clients
𝑁and the model size on the convergence rate. Due to the space
limit, details pertaining to these experimental settings and results
are presented in Appendices C.3, C.4, C.5, and C.6 respectively.
In a nutshell, as shown in Fig. 5, a suitable learning rate anchored
at1/√
𝑑leads to stabilized training dynamics, while larger ones ex-
hibit divergence as suggested by our analysis (Section 3.3). Besides,
dissimilar splitters symbolize varying extents of data heterogeneity,
and we have observations revealing that augmented heterogeneity
culminates in lower stabilized loss values (as shown in Fig. 6). This
intimates that a moderate degree of data heterogeneity can elevate
the model’s convergence proficiency. Moreover, Fig. 7 verifies our
theoretical analysis in Section 3 that an increase in 𝑁helps stabilize
the global convergence.
5.4 Personalization Study
To reconcile Proposition 3.7 with practical scenarios, we conduct
the following subsequent experiments. To account for each client’s
heterogeneity during model updates in each round, we derive three
signal quantities: (1) Round-wise Train Loss Difference : The discrep-
ancy between each client’s loss in the preceding training round and
the global loss. (2) Five-round Average Train Loss Difference : The
average loss deviation for each client relative to the global loss over
the antecedent five rounds. (3) Model Parameter Update Difference :
The disparity between each client’s previous round parameter up-
dates and the global update magnitude. We normalize them to the
range of(−1,1), serving as empirical estimates for Φ.
For the setting of the scaling factor 𝛼, following the guidance
of the learning rate in Section 3.3, we designate 1.5×10−5as the
maximal learning rate, potentially leading to surges as per the
learning rate search network. Symmetrically, we posit the minimal
value at 5×10−6, anchored on the default learning rate of 1×10−5,
thereby assigning 𝛼a value of 5×10−6.

ing rate of 1×10−5, while the other randomly selects within
[5×10−6,1.5×10−5]for each round. The conclusive results are
depicted in Figure 4. Based on the experimental results, we observe
that our method achieves faster loss convergence with the second
and third types of signal quantities compared to the default and
random settings, with the third type yielding the most impressive
performance. In contrast, the first type of signal quantity had a
negligible impact. These results suggest that while round-wise loss
exhibits some degree of randomness, aggregating losses over multi-
ple rounds can approximate heterogeneity to a meaningful extent,
thus serving as an indicator to expedite model convergence.
It is also noteworthy that the third type of signal quantity aligns
with the expression ∥∇𝑓(𝜃𝑡)−Í𝐻
𝑘=0𝜂𝑖∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃(𝑡,𝑘))∥2, which most
closely reflects Assumption 6. Consequently, it demonstrates the
most effective performance in the experiments, not only achiev-
ing the fastest convergence but also the lowest stable loss. This
case study experiment substantiates the efficacy of Proposition 3.7,
offering valuable insights for parameter tuning in personalized FL.
6 CONCLUSION
This work investigates the convergence of FedMeZO, a practical
approach integrating Memory-efficient Zeroth-Order Optimization
within a federated learning setting for Large Language Models
(LLMs). Extensive empirical results verified our analyses and in-
dicated that FedMeZO achieves fast convergence with reduced
GPU memory requirements, offering a promising alternative to
traditional optimization methods. The incorporation of a person-
alized learning rate adjustment, derived from theoretical analysis,
has been shown to effectively enhance loss reduction. Through
this study, we aim to enlighten more research and development
of memory-efficient optimization techniques to address practical
challenges associated with the fine-tuning of LLMs, particularly in
resource-constrained scenarios [29].

APPENDIX
A DETAILED ASSUMPTIONS
Assumption 2. (Bounded Loss) The global loss function 𝑓(𝜃)is
bounded below by a scalar 𝑓∗, i.e.,𝑓∗≥𝑓(𝜃)>−∞for all𝜃.
Assumption 3. (𝐿-smoothness) The local and global loss functions
𝐹𝑖(𝜃,B𝑖),𝑓𝑖(𝜃), and𝑓(𝜃)are L-smooth. Mathematically, for any
𝜃1,𝜃2∈R𝑑, it holds that
∥∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃2)−∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃1)∥≤𝐿∥𝜃2−𝜃1∥,
𝑓𝑖(𝜃2)≤𝑓𝑖(𝜃1)+⟨∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃),𝜃2−𝜃1⟩+𝐿
2∥𝜃2−𝜃1∥2.
Assumption 4. (Mini-batch Gradient Error Bound) For any
𝜃∈R𝑑, the second-order moment of the stochastic gradient is bounded
byEB𝑖∥∇𝐹𝑖(𝜃,B𝑖)∥2≤𝑐𝑔∥∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃)∥2+𝜎2𝑔, where𝑐𝑔≥1.
Assumption 5. (Global-Local Disparities in i.i.d. Setting) For
any𝜃∈R𝑑, the discrepancy between the local and global gradient is
negligible, i.e., E𝑖∥∇𝑓(𝜃)−∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃)∥2=0.
Assumption 6. (Global-Local Disparities in Non-i.i.d. Setting)
For any𝜃∈R𝑑, the discrepancy between the local and global gradient
is bounded by∥∇𝑓(𝜃)−∇𝑓𝑖(𝜃)∥2≤𝑐ℎ∥∇𝑓(𝜃)∥2+𝜎2
ℎ,where𝑐ℎis
a positive constant.
Assumptions 2-4 are well-established in the literature on large-
scale stochastic optimization [ 5]. Assumption 5 describes an ideal
i.i.d. setting where each client’s gradient is aligned with the global
gradient. Assumption 6 accounts for the heterogeneity of client
data distributions that is typical in non-i.i.d. settings [36, 37, 55].
B IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
B.1 Datasets
We adopt several federated tuning datasets tailored for LLMs from
[32], with different splitting strategies to simulate the heterogeneity
typical of different federated learning (FL) scenarios, including a
uniform distribution of data, a Dirichlet distribution of data, and a
splitter based on meta-information. The proportion of test data for
each dataset is 1%.
Table 2: Datasets and Basic Information.
Name #Sample Domain
Fed-Alpaca [51] 52.0k Generic Language
Fed-Dolly [15] 15.0k Generic Language
Fed-GSM8K [14] 7.5k CoT
Fed-CodeAlpaca [7] 8.0k Code Generation
B.2 Experimental Platforms
We implement our approaches using PyTorch [ 45] v1.10.1, coupled
with PEFT v0.3.0 and the Transformers library [ 57] v4.29.2. Exper-
iments with LLaMA-3B are conducted on a computing platform
equipped with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB), with pre-trained
LLMs loaded as 16-bit floating-point numbers.B.3 Default Implementation Settings
Following the guidelines in [ 32,39], all approaches perform local
training with a batch size of 1. To standardize the experimental
conditions, both BP-based and FedMeZO train locally with specific
learning rates: 𝜂=1×10−5for the Fed-Dolly and Fed-Alpaca
datasets,𝜂=2×10−5for the Fed-CodeAlpaca dataset, and 𝜂=2.5×
10−5for the Fed-GSM8K dataset. The rank and alpha parameters
for LoRA are set to 128 and 256. As per [ 39], the perturbation
scale𝜇for FedMeZO is set to 1×10−3. We employed the early
stopping mechanism following previous works [ 9]. The training
was stopped if there was no improvement in the validation loss
within 30 epochs. The best model was selected from the epoch with
the lowest validation loss. We conducted three sets of experiments
with randomly selected seeds, and calculated the mean as the line
plot with a 90% confidence interval as the error bar.
C SUPPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENTS
C.1 Communication Cost of FedMeZO
In Section 2.2, we mention using LoRA [ 29] to reduce the substantial
communication overhead. We theoretically prove this method’s
equivalence to full-parameter transmission as follows:
𝜃𝑡+1,0
𝑖=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝜃𝑡,𝐻
𝑖=1

=𝜃𝑡,0
𝑖+1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝐻∑︁
𝑘=1∇𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝜃𝑡,𝑘
𝑖(28)
Note that the left side represents the client’s parameters with
FedAvg, while the right side corresponds to FedMeZO, and they
are equivalent. By utilizing LoRA, FedMeZO achieves the same
effect with just 1.23% of parameters in our setting. Specifically, full
parameter transmission needs 6.39GB, while LoRA demands merely
80.45MB.
C.2 Evaluations with Common LLM’s Metrics
We examined FedMeZO with some commonly used metrics for
LLMs evaluations: Dolly with MMLU metrics [ 27], Code with Ope-
nAI HumanEval metrics [ 13], and GSM8K with CoT metrics[ 14].
We evaluated FedMeZO and BP-based FedAvg at model checkpoints
of rounds 0, 100, 200 and present the results in Table 3. The results
verified FedMeZO’s effectiveness again:
•Fine-tuning LLMs with FedMeZO effectively improves their
performance on specific tasks;
•FedMeZO gains better performance compared to BP-based
FedAvg.

C.3 Conditions for the Learning Rate
We disabled the early-stop mechanism and sequentially selected
four learning rates: 1×10−5,3×10−5,5×10−5, and 1×10−4on
the GSM-IID dataset, then conducted training for 500 rounds each.
The results are presented in Figure 5, which indicate that the loss
function exhibits a sharp increase when the learning rate exceeds
the range supported by theory. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that
our theory suggests that an optimal learning rate magnitude is
anchored at 1/√
𝑑in Section 3.3. In our chosen model, LLaMA-3B,
where𝑑can be set to 3×109, this gives 1/√

C.4 The Impact of Heterogeneity on
Convergence
We present the results of processing the same dataset with different
splitters in Figure 6. It is observable that in the Dolly and CodeAl-
paca datasets, the LDA and Meta splitters perform better than IID,
with Meta being the best. Noting that the data classified by Meta
and LDA are non-i.i.d. , this indicates that higher data heterogeneity
is more conducive to model convergence.

Figure 6: Effects of different splitters on the same dataset.C.5 The Impact of Client Number
In Figure 7, we showcase the outcomes of federated learning on
the same Alpaca dataset with 3 clients and 8 clients, respectively.
This demonstrates that the model converges more stably with more
clients participating in the training. This conclusion also corre-
sponds to the theoretical results regarding the number of clients
𝑁discussed in Section 3, i.e., an increase in 𝑁is beneficial for
reducing global convergence.

C.6 The Impact of Model Size
To investigate the and versatility of FedMeZO across different model
sizes, based on LLaMA2-7B [ 53], we conducted experiments us-
ing the same experimental setup on three datasets: Dolly-Meta,
CodeAlpaca-LDA and GSM8K-IID. The experimental results are
shown in Table 4. The results show that FedMeZO on LLaMA2-7B
retains similar trends, while starts with lower Loss than 3B-model
by 0.2 and 0.12 in Dolly-Meta and GSM8K-IID. For all tasks, 7B-
model’s loss decreases more slowly, with reductions at 300 rounds
being only 34%, 67%, and 41% of the 3B-model’s in Dolly-Meta,
Code-LDA, and GSM8K-IID.
