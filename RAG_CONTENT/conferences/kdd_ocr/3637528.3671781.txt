Abstract
Natural language explainable recommendation has become a promis-
ing direction to facilitate more efficient and informed user decisions.
Previous models mostly focus on how to enhance the explana-
tion accuracy. However, the robustness problem has been largely
ignored, which requires the explanations generated for similar
user-item pairs should not be too much different. Different from
traditional classification problems, improving the robustness of nat-
ural languages has two unique characteristics: (1) Different token
importances, that is, different tokens play various roles in repre-
senting the complete sentence, and the robustness requirements for
predicting them should also be different. (2) Continuous token
semantics, that is, the similarity of the output should be judged
based on semantics, and the sequences without any token-level
overlap may also be highly similar. Based on these characteristics,
we formulate and solve a novel problem in the recommendation
domain, that is, robust natural language explainable recommen-
dation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time in this
field. Specifically, we base our modeling on adversarial robust opti-
mization and design four types of heuristic methods to modify the
adversarial outputs with weighted token probabilities and synonym
replacements. Furthermore, to consider the mutual influence be-
tween the above characteristics, we regard language generation as
a decision-making problem and design a dual-policy reinforcement
learning framework to improve the robustness of the generated
languages. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework.

1 Introduction
Explainable recommendation seeks to provide users with explana-
tions clarifying why a particular item is recommended to them [ 46].
With the capability to improve system transparency and user sat-
isfaction, generating reasonable explanations is recognized as a
promising direction in recommender systems (RecSys). Among var-
ious strategies, natural language explanations have emerged as a
pivotal approach, capable of offering more flexible and informative
explanations to facilitate user decision-making. Generally, these
approaches utilize user reviews as explanation labels for supervised
training and generate explanatory texts about recommended items
in the inference phase. In order to improve the accuracy of pre-
dicted explanations, NRT [ 21] integrates explanation generation
with rating prediction. NETE [ 18] incorporates specific features
into the decoding process. PETER [ 19] utilizes the Transformer to
learn better sequence representations for further improvement.
Although these methods have achieved impressive performance,
they mainly focus on designing advanced architectures to enhance
explanation accuracy while neglecting the aspect of robustness,
which can impair model’s generalization ability, resulting in poor
performance on unseen data [ 10,15,34]. The robustness in ex-
plainable recommendation requires the explanations generated for
similar user-item pairs should not be too much different. However,
existing methods often fail to satisfy this criterion. Figure 1 illus-
trates examples of recommendation explanations generated by the
PETER model on the real-world datasets. The first case presents the

ating explanations, produced by the PETER model.
explanations generated for two similar users, 𝑢1and𝑢2, regarding
the same pizza. We observe that in the explanation for 𝑢1, the word
“cardboard” indicates poor taste, which conflicts to the term “good”
in the explanation for 𝑢2. The second case shows the explanations
for𝑢3about two similar pillows, 𝑖2and𝑖3, which possess same
features. Likewise, there is a contradiction where the word “hard”
implies a negative opinion, conflicting with the term "comfortable"
mentioned in the first sentence. Considering these observations, if
we create a fabricated user (or item) by introducing minor perturba-
tions to the original user’s (or item’s) representation, the model may
generate explanations that differ significantly. This susceptibility
to minor perturbations indicates the poor robustness of models.
Moreover, such inconsistency in explanations can potentially cause
user confusion and undermine system’s credibility.
To address the aforementioned issue, we propose to enhance
robustness for natural language explainable recommendation. It is
an important yet unexplored problem, posing various challenges.
Existing studies on robust optimization [ 12,30] mainly focus on
classification tasks, such as image classification and click-through
rate prediction. The goal of robustness in these studies is to main-
tain consistent predictions when subjected to minor perturbations.
However, generating explanation involves sequence generation,
thus directly applying the prior methods is unfeasible. Specifically,
there are two unique characteristics that should be considered for
the robustness of sequence generation: different token importances
and continuous token semantics. The former refers that different
tokens play various roles in representing the complete sentence,
and the robustness requirements for predicting them should also
be different. The latter indicates that the similarity of the output
should be judged based on semantics, and the sequences without
any token-level overlap may also be highly similar. Moreover, it is
imperative to integrate these characteristics and capture the mutual
influence between them for comprehensive robustness. This paper
represents an significant extension of the traditional robust method
in sequence generation problem, which has not been explored.
To overcome these challenges, we propose to design a compre-
hensive robust framework for explainable recommendation based
on adversarial learning. We begin by defining the objective function
for adversarial robustness in the explanation generation task, which
differs significantly from that in the classification task and can be
easily extended to other sequence generation tasks. Additionally,
to model two unique characteristics of sequence generation, we
design both context-free and context-aware methods for token im-
portance estimation and synonym replacement. To consider the
mutual influence between these characteristics, we regard sequence
generation as a decision-making problem and develop a dual-policy
reinforcement learning framework, where each task is assigned toan agent and optimized through maximum likelihood estimation
with a shared reward mechanism. It enables us to obtain collabora-
tive strategies for constructing adversarial examples.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as
follows: (1) We formulate the robustness objective in sequence
generation, which differs from that in classification problem. And
we propose a Robustness-enhanced framework for natural language
explainable r ecommendation (called Rober for short). To the best
of our knowledge, it is the first time in recommendation domain.
(2) We analyze two key characteristics of sequence generation and
design a dual-policy reinforcement learning framework to capture
the mutual influence between them. (3) Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements achieved by our
framework on the quality and robustness of explanations.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Natural Language Explanations for RecSys
Natural language explainable recommendation aims to generate
textual explanations about the recommended items, offering users
informative and accessible insights. Generally, these approaches
utilize user reviews, which encompass user preferences, as sub-
stitutes for real explanations [ 9,11,18,19,21], and transform ex-
planation generation into review prediction task. Formally, given
a user setUand an item setI, the interactions are recorded in
D={(𝑢,𝑖,𝒆𝑢𝑖,𝑟𝑢𝑖)|𝑢∈U,𝑖∈I} , where𝑟𝑢𝑖represents user’s
rating, ranging from 1 to 5, and 𝒆𝑢𝑖={𝑒1
𝑢𝑖,𝑒2
𝑢𝑖,...,𝑒𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑢𝑖}represents
user𝑢’s review on item 𝑖.𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖, drawn from the vocabulary V, is the
𝑡-th word of the review and 𝑙𝑢𝑖denotes the review length.
The objective of natural language explainable recommenda-
tion is to accurately predict the review ˆ𝒆𝑢𝑖and rating ˆ𝑟𝑢𝑖for a
given user-item pair (𝑢,𝑖)as input. To achieve this, various ap-
proaches propose to integrate these two prediction tasks into a
unified architecture with parameters 𝜽. Specifically, review pre-
diction is performed using sequence generation model 𝑔𝐸, such
as GRU [ 18,21] and Transformer [ 19]. It is optimized by max-
imizing the likelihood of the observed review through the loss
function𝐿𝐸
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽=Í𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑡=1−log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,𝜽), where
𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖represents the subsequence before the 𝑡-th word. The
component for rating prediction 𝑔𝑅, is optimized by minimizing
the mean square error between the real and predicted ratings as
𝐿𝑅
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽=(𝑟𝑢𝑖−𝑔𝑅(𝑢,𝑖,𝜽))2. These two parts are combined to form
the final objective function 𝐿=𝐿𝐸
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽+𝛼𝐿𝑅
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽. Existing methods
often prioritize enhancing explanation accuracy while neglecting
robustness, which can adversely affect the generalization of models.
2.2 Adversarial Training for RecSys
Adversarial training [ 2] is a powerful approach for enhancing the
robustness of models against adversarial attacks [ 3,24,26]. Given a
general classification model 𝜽and a sample(𝑥,𝑦)from datasetD,
𝑥is the input feature and 𝑦is the corresponding label. Adversarial
training aims to minimize the maximum of training loss over the
adversarial example (𝑥+𝜹,𝑦), which is formulated as:
min
𝜽max
𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖E(𝑥,𝑦)∈D𝐿(𝑥+𝜹,𝑦;𝜽),(1)
4204Natural Language Explainable Recommendation
with Robustness Enhancement KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
where 𝜹represents the input perturbation obtained by maximizing
the loss function and 𝜖controls the magnitude of perturbations.
Various methods have been proposed [ 14,16,23,41] to estimate the
optimal perturbation 𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=arg max 𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖𝐿(𝑥+𝜹,𝑦,ˆ𝜽), such
as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [ 14]. It approximates
perturbation using the gradient descent of the loss function with
respect to 𝜽as𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=𝜖sign(∇𝐿(𝑥+𝜹,𝑦,𝜽)).
In the field of recommender systems, given a user-item pair (𝑢,𝑖),
the task of predicting user’s preference 𝑦∈{0,1}on the item is
a typical classification problem. It is optimized by minimizing the
negative log-likelihood of the label 𝑦using the loss function 𝐿=
−log𝑝(𝑦|𝑢,𝑖,𝜽). Unlike the image domain where perturbations
are directly added to input data to obtain adversarial examples, most
recommender models introduce adversarial perturbations to the
underlying model parameters due to the discrete nature of input
(e.g., user/item IDs). Thus the objective function for adversarial
training in recommender systems can be expressed as:
min
𝜽E(𝑢,𝑖,𝑦)∈D𝐿=−log𝑝(𝑦|𝑢,𝑖,𝜽)−𝜆log𝑝(𝑦|𝑢,𝑖,𝜽+𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣),
where 𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=arg max
𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖−log𝑝(𝑦|𝑢,𝑖, ˆ𝜽+𝜹),(2)
where ˆ𝜽represents the parameters of the current model. Previous
studies [ 30] are mostly based on classification problems, with rare
research on the robustness of sequence generation tasks, which is
the focus of this paper.
3 The Robust Framework
In this section, we begin by defining the objective of robustness for
natural language explainable recommendation. Then, we analyze
two crucial characteristics that contribute to the robustness of se-
quence generation. Finally, we propose a dual-policy reinforcement
learning framework to capture the mutual influence between the
above characteristics.
3.1 Objective with Robustness Enhancement
In the task of explanation generation, the labels correspond to tex-
tual sequences, which differ from the labels used in traditional
classification tasks. When obtaining adversarial perturbations, in-
stead of directly minimizing the likelihood of the target category,
we aim to minimize the sum of the likelihood of the target word
(also called token) at each position in the sentence. For the model
optimization, it is achieved by maximizing the likelihood of the
target labels across both the original data and associated adversarial
examples. The robustness objective is defined as follows:
min
𝜽E(𝑢,𝑖,𝒆𝑢𝑖,𝑟𝑢𝑖)∈D𝐿=𝐿𝐸
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽+𝛼𝐿𝑅
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽+𝜆𝐿𝐸
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽+𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣
=−𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,𝜽)+𝛼(𝑟𝑢𝑖−𝑔𝑅(𝑢,𝑖,𝜽))2
−𝜆𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,𝜽+𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣),
where 𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=arg max
𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖−𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,ˆ𝜽+𝜹).(3)
The third part 𝐿𝐸
𝑢,𝑖,𝜽+𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣represents the prediction on adversarial
examples, which can be treated as a regularizer with the weight 𝜆.
This objective function can be easily extended to other sequencegeneration tasks. To obtain adversarial perturbation 𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣tailored
for sequence generation, we analyze two unique characteristics:
different token importances and continuous token semantics.
3.2 Modeling Token Importance
It is apparent that different tokens play various roles in representing
the complete sentence. For example, as illustrated in Figure 2(a), in
the sentence “the pizza tasted like cardboard”, the words “pizza",
“tasted" and “cardboard" play crucial roles in describing the topic and
conveying the main meaning of the sentence. On the other hand, the
words “the" and “like" hold less importance in conveying sentence
meaning, which just complete the grammatical structure. Thus the
adversarial requirements for predicting different tokens should also
be various. It is expected that tokens with higher importance will
be predicted harder. We obtain the adversarial perturbations by
assigning corresponding importance to each token, denoted as:
𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=arg max
𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖−𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖·log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,ˆ𝜽+𝜹),(4)
where𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖is the importance weight for the token 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖. Unlike tradi-
tional methods that treat each token equally, we employ weighted
token probabilities, simple yet effective considering the importance
of various tokens.
To estimate the token importance, one straightforward approach
is to leverage token frequency. We employ TF-IDF (Term Frequency-
Inverse Document Frequency) [ 28] to measure token importance.
It is calculated as:
𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖=𝑀𝑡
𝑙𝑢𝑖·log|D|
𝑁𝑡+1, (5)
where𝑀𝑡represents the frequency that 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖appears in 𝒆𝑢𝑖, and
𝑁𝑡=|{𝒆:𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖∈𝒆}|is the number of reviews that contain 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖.
Although above method can effectively estimate importance
from token-level, it overlooks a critical aspect: the importance of
a token can vary across different sentences. As mentioned before,
the word “like” holds less significance as a preposition in “the pizza
tasted like cardboard”. However, in the sentence “I like the taste of
this pizza”, “like” is vital for expressing preference. Therefore, we
propose to estimate token importance by considering its context,
which can be achieved through cosine similarity between the target
token and the sentence representations. We use the symbol “ ˜” to
denote context-awareness and the importance is calculated as:
˜𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖=𝜎(cos(v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖,v𝒆𝑢𝑖))=𝜎(v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖·v𝒆𝑢𝑖
∥v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖∥∥v𝒆𝑢𝑖∥), (6)
where𝜎denotes the Sigmoid function, mapping the results into
the interval of 0 to 1. v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖is the representation for the token 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖
and the entire sentence 𝒆𝑢𝑖is represented as v𝒆𝑢𝑖=1
𝑙𝑢𝑖Í𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑡=1v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖,
which takes the mean of token vectors in the sentence.
3.3 Modeling Token Semantics
Another notable characteristic is that a token can be substituted
with its synonyms to convey the same meaning. As shown in Fig-
ure 2(b), in “the pillow is a bit hard”, the word “hard” can be replaced
with “solid” to express dissatisfaction with the pillow. Thus the sim-
ilarity of the output should be judged based on semantics, and the

tence. (b) Examples of continuous token semantics. (c) Illus-
tration of the mutual influence between token importance
and synonym space in “The pizza tasted like cardboard”.
sequences with less token-level overlap may also be highly simi-
lar. To this end, we modify the targeted perturbation and further
minimize the likelihood of the target token’s synonyms:
𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=arg max
𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖−𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1∑︁
𝑠∈𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑠|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,ˆ𝜽+𝜹),(7)
where𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖denotes the set of the most approximate synonyms of
the token𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖, including the token itself.
To determine the synonym set 𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖, a sample yet powerful method
is to calculate the cosine similarity between the representation of
the target token and the other tokens in the vocabulary, and then
select𝑘tokens with the highest similarity scores:
𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖={𝑠|𝑠∈arg𝑘max
𝑠∈V(cos(v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖,v𝑠))}, (8)
where the arg max function is used to retrieve the set of 𝑘tokens
that exhibit the highest similarity to the target token 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖.
While this method is effective, a limitation is that it fails to
consider context, which potentially leads to inappropriate synonym
replacements. For example, in Figure 2(b), although both “solid”
and “difficult” are two synonyms of the word “hard”, “solid” usually
describes the attributes of a concrete object, while “difficult” is more
suitable for abstract concepts such as problems or tasks. Therefore,
it is inappropriate to use “difficult” to describe a pillow in the first
sentence and replace the word “hard” with “solid” in the second
sentence. To address this concern, we propose a context-aware
approach for synonym replacement based on the above synonym
set𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖. Specifically, we substitute the target token 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖with each
synonym𝑠∈𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖and assess the likelihood of the resulting sentence
𝒔𝑢𝑖={𝑒1
𝑢𝑖,𝑒2
𝑢𝑖,...,𝑠,...,𝑒𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑢𝑖}. We then select the top 𝑘′tokens (𝑘′≤
𝑘) with the highest likelihood to form the context-aware synonym
set˜𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖, which can be expressed as:
˜𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖={𝑠|𝑠∈arg𝑘′
max
𝑠∈𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖(𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑠𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒔1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,𝜽))}, (9)
where𝑠𝑡
𝑢𝑖is the𝑡-th token in 𝒔𝑢𝑖after replacing 𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖with𝑠.
3.4 Dual-Policy Robust Framework
The first characteristic allows us to assign different weights to
tokens within sentences, promoting a better understanding of exist-
ing data. Meanwhile, the second characteristic performs synonym
replacements on the original data, serving as data augmentation.
These two characteristics enhance the effectiveness of adversarial
learning from different perspectives, while also complementingeach other. Thus, we integrate them into the perturbation acquisi-
tion process and obtain the targeted adversarial perturbation for
sequence generation tasks as follows:
𝜹𝑎𝑑𝑣=arg max
𝜹,∥𝜹∥≤𝜖−𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖·∑︁
𝑠∈𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑠|𝑢,𝑖,𝒆1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,ˆ𝜽+𝜹).
(10)
Besides, in order to consider the context information, we can trans-
form𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖to˜𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖and𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖to˜𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖, respectively.
To obtain the above perturbation, we can straightforwardly inte-
grate the methods of importance estimation in Section 3.2 and syn-
onym replacement in Section 3.3. However, these methods model
the characteristics independently and direct combinations may re-
sult in suboptimal perturbations and weaken the effectiveness of
adversarial learning. Specifically, when obtaining 𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖and𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖, it is
essential to consider the mutual influence between the importance
weight and the synonym space of tokens. Intuitively, tokens with
higher importance should have a smaller synonym space compared
to those with lower importance. This consideration is because if the
synonym space is too large, the higher importance weight could
amplify the inaccuracy resulting from substituting the target token
with a less similar synonym.
As illustrated in Figure 2(c), the selection of synonyms for the im-
portant tokens such as “pizza” and “cardboard” should be limited to
a narrow space around them to ensure the preservation of the sen-
tence’s intended meaning. Conversely, for the less important words
like “the”, a broader space is allowed since their replacement have
minimal impact on the overall meaning. Therefore, effective coordi-
nation between the two characteristics is imperative for achieving
optimal perturbations. However, there are several challenges to
overcome. On the one hand, since these tasks involve sequential
decision-making, it is crucial to model the cumulative effectiveness
of decisions. On the other hand, a common optimization objective
is necessary to establish collaboration between these tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose a dual-policy reinforce-
ment learning framework, where each task is assigned to a dedi-
cated agent. The agents are optimized using maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a shared reward function that evaluates the
quality of adversarial examples. We use REINFORCE method [ 38]
with policy explorations. The basic elements of the framework are
formulated as follows:
•Action: The estimated importance weight 𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖and selected syn-
onyms set𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖for the𝑡-th token𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖in the sentence.
•State: The state at step 𝑡is𝒉𝑡=(𝑢,𝑖,𝒆𝑢𝑖,𝑰1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖,𝑺1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖), where
𝑰1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖={𝐼1
𝑢𝑖,𝐼2
𝑢𝑖,...,𝐼𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖}and𝑺1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖={𝑆1
𝑢𝑖,𝑆2
𝑢𝑖,...,𝑆𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖}are the
importance and synonyms for the tokens in subsequence 𝒆1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖.
We denote the outcome set as:
𝜏1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖={𝑰1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖,𝑺1:𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖}={(𝐼1
𝑢𝑖,𝑆1
𝑢𝑖),(𝐼2
𝑢𝑖,𝑆2
𝑢𝑖),...,(𝐼𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖,𝑆𝑡−1
𝑢𝑖)}.
•Agent: Two agents, denoted as 𝜋𝐼and𝜋𝑆, are designed with re-
spective policy networks. The role of 𝜋𝐼is to estimate the token im-
portance within a continuous action space ranging from 0 to 1, while
𝜋𝑆is responsible for exploring synonyms from the given vocabulary
V. More specifically, 𝜋𝐼is implemented as 𝜋𝐼=𝜎(𝑊ℎ[v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖,v𝒆𝑢𝑖]),
which utilizes a multi-layer fully connected neural networks with
the Sigmoid function. The inputs are the concatenation of the rep-
resentations of the target token and the sentence. 𝜋𝑆can be defined
4206Natural Language Explainable Recommendation
with Robustness Enhancement KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
as𝜋𝑆=softmax(𝑬·v𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖), where 𝑬∈RV×𝑑represents the embed-
ding matrix for the tokens in V, and the output layer utilizes the
softmax function to produce the token similarities.
•Reward: With the 𝑰𝑢𝑖and𝑺𝑢𝑖obtained by agents, the reward
function is comprised of two components. Firstly, to encourage
smoothness and coherence, it evaluates the likelihood of the new
sentence 𝒔𝑢𝑖={𝑠1
𝑢𝑖,𝑠2
𝑢𝑖,...,𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑢𝑖}, which is formed by replacing each
token𝑒𝑡
𝑢𝑖in the original sentence 𝒆𝑢𝑖={𝑒1
𝑢𝑖,𝑒2
𝑢𝑖,...,𝑒𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑢𝑖}with its
synonym𝑠𝑡
𝑢𝑖∈𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖. Secondly, we constrain the similarity between
the new sentence and the original review to maintain consistency in
sentence meaning. The reward is calculated after the entire process
𝜏={𝑰𝑢𝑖,𝑺𝑢𝑖}for the review 𝒆𝑢𝑖, which is defined as:
𝑅(𝜏)=𝑙𝑢𝑖∑︁
𝑡=1𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖·log𝑔𝐸(𝑒=𝑠𝑡
𝑢𝑖|𝑢,𝑖,𝒔1:(𝑡−1)
𝑢𝑖,𝜽)+𝛽·𝑐𝑜𝑠(v𝒔𝑢𝑖,v𝒆𝑢𝑖),
where v𝒔𝑢𝑖=1
𝑙𝑢𝑖Í𝑙𝑢𝑖
𝑡=1𝐼𝑡
𝑢𝑖v𝑠𝑡
𝑢𝑖is the representation of the new sen-
tence and𝛽controls the degree of encouraging similarity. To ensure
the correspondence between 𝜏and𝒔𝑢𝑖, in practice, we limit the
number of synonyms selected at each iteration to one, i.e.,|𝑆𝑡
𝑢𝑖|=1.
During the optimization process, the parameters of two agents
(𝜽𝐼and𝜽𝑆) are updated though a reward-enhanced MLE approach.
Specifically, for 𝜋𝐼, we formulate its objective function as 𝐿𝐼(𝜽𝐼)=Í
𝑰𝑢𝑖∼𝜋𝐼𝑅(𝜏)𝑝(𝑰𝑢𝑖). According to the “log derivative trick” [ 31], we
obtain gradients as ∇𝜽𝐼𝐿𝐼(𝜽𝐼)=Í
𝑰𝑢𝑖∼𝜋𝐼𝑅(𝜏)𝑝(𝑰𝑢𝑖)∇𝜽𝐼log𝑝(𝑰𝑢𝑖).
This expression can be further derived as:
∇𝜽𝐼𝐿𝐼(𝜽𝐼)=E𝑰𝑢𝑖∼𝜋𝐼

The parameters of recommender model are optimized using sto-
chastic gradient descent (SGD), ignoring the impact of two agents.
In summary, our dual-policy approach integrates importance
estimation and synonym replacement into a unified framework
to capture the mutual influence between two characteristics. It
effectively prompts the collaboration between two auxiliary tasks
for acquiring optimal targeted perturbation. The complete learning
procedure is presented in Algorithm 1.
4 Related Work
In this section, we briefly review the prior research in the related
fields and discuss their relations with our paper.
Explainable recommendation. Recent years have witnessed
significant advancements in explainable recommendation [ 8,33,46],
where various types of explanations are provided, such as user pre-
ferred features [ 6,7,44,47] and reasoning paths on knowledge
graph [ 1,36,39]. One notable strategy is generating natural lan-
guage explanations, which are flexible and informative. SeveralAlgorithm 1: Learning Algorithm of Rober

methods integrate explanation generation with rating prediction in
a unified architecture and produce explanations utilizing sequential
models like LSTM [ 21], GRU [ 18], and Transformer [ 19]. Addition-
ally, many studies aim to improve the quality of explanations in
various aspects, including informativeness [ 13,17], personaliza-
tion [ 4,20,42,43] and coherence [ 40]. However, these methods pri-
marily focus on improving explanation accuracy while neglecting
the robustness of the generated explanations. Our study proposes
to enhance the robustness of existing explainable recommender
models, which differs from previous works.
Adversarial training. Another relevant aspect is adversarial
training [ 2]. It is originally proposed in the field of image classifi-
cation [ 14], where models are susceptible to producing incorrect
outputs under small adversarial perturbations. Subsequently, adver-
sarial training is explored in various fields, including recommender
systems [ 10,27,37]. For example, IRGAN [ 35] utilizes Generative
Adversarial Net (GAN) to obtain effective embeddings for Matrix
Factorization. APR [ 15] investigates the robustness of personal-
ized ranking by introducing perturbations to model parameters.
Additionally, researchers explore the utilization of adversarial train-
ing in various recommendation scenarios. For instance, improving
accuracy for multimedia recommendation [ 34], cascade-guided ad-
versarial training for sequential recommendation [ 32], and univer-
sal graph perturbations for GNN-based recommendation [ 5,29].
However, these studies focus on classification problem, our study
represents the first attempt to explore the employment of adver-
sarial learning in generating natural language explanations, which
involves sequence generation. We also provides inspiration for
improving the robustness of other text generation tasks.

5 Experiments
5.1 Experiment Setup
Datasets. To evaluate our framework comprehensively, we con-
duct experiments based on three real-world datasets from different
domains. Yelp Challenge 2019 (YELP) records user’s ratings and
reviews for various restaurants. TripAdvisor-HongKong (TA-
HK) includes user’s interactions with different hotels in Hong
Kong, which are crawled from TripAdvisor1, a popular travel web-
site.Amazon Movies&TV (AZ-MT) is collected from the Amazon
platform and reflects user preferences on movies and TV shows.
Table 1 provides detailed statistics of these datasets.
Baselines. In this study, we implement three representative nat-
ural language explainable models: NRT [21] is a typical review
generation model based on GRU that combines review generation
with rating prediction. NETE [18] utilizes a gated fusion recurrent
unit (GFRU) to incorporate features into the decoding process for
controllable explanations. PETER [19] employs the Transformer
architecture to generate personalized explanations by bridging IDs
and words. We apply our framework to these three models and
compare the performance with their original versions. Suppose the
original model is X, we can obtain X-Rober by applying the final
dual-policy framework introduced in Section 3.4 to X. Additionally,
we denote the context-free and context-aware methods for token
importance estimation in Section 3.2 as 𝑰and˜𝑰, and the methods
for synonym replacement in Section 3.3 as 𝑺and˜𝑺. The symbol “
˜” represents considering the context information. Therefore, the
combinations of these heuristic methods result in four additional
variants: X-𝑰-𝑺,X-˜𝑰-𝑺,X-𝑰-˜𝑺,X-˜𝑰-˜𝑺.
Evaluating Metrics. To measure the quality of generated expla-
nations, we employ two distinct types of metrics. BLEU-{1,4} [ 25]
and ROUGE-{1,2} [ 22] assess text similarity by comparing n-gram
matches between the generated explanations and the ground-truths.
On the other hand, BERTScore [ 45], a prevalent metric, utilizes
pre-trained language models such as BERT to capture semantic
information and achieve a deeper understanding of context. We
use the F1 score of ROUGE by default and the F1 score, Recall, Pre-
cision of BERTScore for comprehensive evaluation. Higher values
of these metrics indicate a higher quality of explanations. While
our focus is explanation generation, we also measure the accu-
racy of rating prediction to ensure a thorough evaluation. We use
MAE =1
𝑁Í
𝑢,𝑖|𝑟𝑢,𝑖−ˆ𝑟𝑢,𝑖|to calculate the mean absolute error
between the real ratings 𝑟𝑢,𝑖and the predicted ratings ˆ𝑟𝑢,𝑖. A lower
value of MAE signifies better performance.
Implementation details. Each dataset is randomly divided into
three sets for training, validation and testing, with a ratio of 8:1:1.
Each user/item has at least one interaction in the training set. The
vocabularyVis formed by incorporating the 20,000 most frequent
words. The maximum length of generated explanations is limited
to 15, which corresponds to the average length of reviews in the
1https://www.tripadvisor.comdatasets. For all models, the embedding size and batch size are set
to 100 and 128, respectively. The learning rates of the base mod-
els are determined according to their original paper and are set
the same for all variants. Other hyper-parameters are tuned via
grid search. Specifically, the hidden size, number of layers, per-
turbation strength 𝜖and regularizer weight 𝜆are tuned within
the range of{32,64,128,256},{1,2,3,4,5},{0.1,0.5,1,5,10}and
{0.01,0.1,1,10,100}, respectively. The baselines are implemented
based on the code released in NLG4RS2, and the parameters are
configured to optimal values as reported in the original papers or
tuned within the same ranges as our framework.
5.2 Overall Performance
The comprehensive performance are detailed in Table 2. It can be ob-
served that among the base models, NETE and PETER consistently
outperform NRT on all three datasets. This is expected as NETE
incorporates specific item features as auxiliary information for gen-
erating concise descriptions, while PETER utilizes a more advanced
architecture for personalized explanation generation. The winner
between NETE and PETER varies across different datasets, while
PETER usually achieves better performance. This demonstrates the
strength of the Transformer in sequence modeling tasks.
It is encouraging that the variants of our framework generally
improve the performance of the original model for explanation
generation. The improvements in BLEU and ROUGE metrics indi-
cate an enhanced capability to fit explanation ground truths, while
the improvements in BERTScore metric demonstrate the improved
ability in text expression based on semantics. These observations
verify the effectiveness of our framework and suggest that adversar-
ial training contributes to the overall generalization of the models.
Notably, the Rober framework achieves the best performance in
most cases, and the superiority is consistent across all datasets and
metrics. This highlights the significance of modeling the mutual
influence and bridging the collaboration between importance esti-
mation and synonym replacement. The Rober accomplishes that by
assigning two tasks to individual agents that work together towards
a shared reward. Furthermore, we observe that the second-best per-
formance is mostly achieved by the variants considering contextual
information. Among them, the variant ˜𝑰-˜𝑺performs second-best
most frequently. This observation underscores the crucial role of
contextual information in determining the importance and seman-
tics of tokens in specific sentences and emphasizes that analyzing
a token without its surrounding context is inadequate.
Although rating prediction is not the primary focus of this study,
our framework exhibits comparable or superior performance to
the original models in most cases. We also observe some instances
where our framework does not perform well. This is not surprising,
as our strategies prioritize robustness enhancement in explana-
tion generation rather than rating prediction. The introduction of
adversarial perturbations guides the model parameters towards
improving the quality and robustness of generated explanations,
which may impact the accuracy of rating prediction.
5.3 Ablation Study
In this section, we examine the impact of various components
within our framework. In addition to evaluating the performance

of the original models as well as their modified versions ˜𝐼-˜𝑆and
Rober, we also examine the performance of four individual variants:
𝐼,˜𝐼,𝑆and ˜𝑆. They consider only one characteristic when acquir-
ing perturbations. From the results shown in Table 3, we observe
that when modeling only one characteristic, the performance de-
clines compared to the performance of Rober and ˜𝐼-˜𝑆. Moreover,
the performance of 𝐼and˜𝐼is comparable to that of 𝑆and ˜𝑆. Theseobservations indicate the contributions of both characteristics: as-
signing different importance weights to tokens helps emphasize the
main points of the sentence, while replacements with synonyms
enhances the expressiveness of the models. Therefore, disregarding
either characteristic leads to suboptimal performance. It is note-
worthy that the context-aware method ˜𝐼generally outperforms the
context-free method 𝐼, and similarly, ˜𝑆outperforms 𝑆in most cases.

This further underscores the significance of analyzing the impor-
tance of words and their semantics within the surrounding context.
By jointly modeling these two characteristics based on context, our
comprehensive framework achieves superior performance.
5.4 Robustness Evaluation
To further evaluate our framework’s robustness, we conduct ex-
periments to simulate the perturbations of recommender models
on testing samples and examine their performance. Specifically,
adversarial perturbations of various intensities are generated by
adjusting the values of 𝜖in Equation (10) and applied to model’s pa-
rameters for evaluation. Figure 3 presents the results of the original
NRT and PETER models, as well as our Rober framework, on the
TA-HK and YELP datasets. Due to space limitations, similar results
on other models and datasets are omitted. Comparing with the
results in Table 2, we observe that minor perturbations can result
in performance decline for both original models and our frame-
work. Furthermore, as the intensity of perturbation increases, the
performance further deteriorates. These observations demonstrate
the models’ vulnerability. Encouragingly, our framework exhibits a
smaller degree of decline and consistently outperforms the origi-
nal models in all cases. For instance, as the perturbation intensityincreases from 1 to 5, the BERTScore of PETER and PETER-Rober
decreases by 11.65% and 5.12% respectively on the TA-HK dataset,
and on the YELP dataset, the decreases are 23.22% and 9.62%. These
findings reveal that the original models are more vulnerable to per-
turbations compared to our framework, which effectively enhances
the robustness of natural language explainable recommendation
through its elaborate adversarial learning mechanism.
Interestingly, PETER shows a greater decline compared to NRT.
We speculate that this may be due to PETER’s more complex Trans-
former architecture, which is prone to overfitting sparse training
data from recommender systems, leading to poorer performance on
poisoned data. Moreover, the dense interactions in the Transformer
make it highly sensitive to input noise, reducing its robustness.
Therefore, despite PETER’s advanced architecture, it does not guar-
antee superiority in all scenarios. Simpler models, like NRT, may
exhibit better robustness under noisy test conditions.
5.5 Parameters Analysis
Influence of the strength of perturbation 𝜖:𝜖controls the
scale of adversarial perturbations. We investigate its influence and
present the results of NRT-Rober and PETER-Rober models on the
TA-HK and YELP datasets in Figure 4. We can see that the best
performance is generally achieved at a moderate 𝜖, especially for
NRT-Rober. This observation aligns with expectations, since increas-
ing𝜖initially allows for stronger perturbations, which improves the
quality of adversarial examples and leads to gradual performance
improvements. However, too large perturbations can harm the pre-
trained model parameters and degrade the performance. Notably,
both models exhibit lower sensitivity to 𝜖on YELP than on TA-HK.
We speculate that the smaller size of TA-HK dataset renders models
more susceptible to noise, while the larger YELP dataset contains
a wider diversity and richness of samples, helping models capture
more features and reduce sensitivity to perturbations.
Influence of the weight of adversarial regularizer 𝜆:𝜆in
Equation (3) determines the importance weight given to adversarial
examples. Results in Figure 5 show that increasing 𝜆(when𝜆<1)
improves both models’ performance, highlighting the effectiveness
of adversarial learning. Optimal performance is achieved when 𝜆
is set to a moderate range (e.g., 1 ∼10), beyond which, the perfor-
mance gradually declines. We analyze that excessive emphasis on

adversarial examples can cause models to disregard original data,
which is the primary training objective. Moreover, for NRT-Rober,
the optimal values of 𝜆on the BERTScore metric are larger. We
speculate that BERTScore focuses on the text semantics, which is
considered through synonym replacement in our framework, thus
emphasizing adversarial examples helps improve model’s ability in
semantics understanding. Thus, careful tuning of 𝜆is necessary to
balance the original and adversarial examples.
5.6 Qualitative studies
To understand our framework intuitively, Table 4 presents exam-
ples of explanations generated by PETER and PETER-Rober on
the TA-HK dataset, alongside the ground truth explanations (i.e.,
user reviews) for reference. In the first case, PETER-Rober gener-
ates the words “spacious” and “large” that align semantically with
“big” in the review, whereas PETER uses words “nice” and “clean”
to express a general meaning. This demonstrates PETER-Rober’s
ability to capture semantics and utilize specific words that reflect
the key points. In the second case, while both models understand
the positive sentiment on price, PETER-Rober’s use of “reasonable”
more appropriately conveys the intent of “better” on price com-
pared to PETER’s use of “good”. In the third case, PETER-Robersuccessfully substitutes “pretty” with the synonym “very”, showing
a more comprehensive understanding. These examples highlight
our framework’s capacity to identify essential words and emphasize
the significance of semantics in text analysis. By considering word
semantics and conducting synonym replacements during adver-
sarial learning process, our framework can generate explanations
that convey the same meaning as ground truths but with different
expressions. Such capability is challenging for original models.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we propose to enhance the robustness of natural
language explainable recommendation models for the first time. To
achieve this objective, we formulate the robustness objective for
sequence generation tasks based on adversarial robust optimization
and analyze two unique characteristics. Furthermore, we build a
dual-policy reinforcement learning framework to capture the mu-
tual influence between these characteristics. Extensive experiments
show the effectiveness of our framework in improving model’s ro-
bustness and generality. There is still room for improvement, such
as designing finer methods to measure token-sequence relation-
ships. This paper provides valuable insights for the robustness in
sequence generation tasks, with potential applications in machine
translation, text summarization, and other tasks.
