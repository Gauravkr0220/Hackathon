Abstract
Sequential Recommendation (SR) navigates users’ dynamic pref-
erences through modeling their historical interactions. The incor-
poration of the popular Transformer framework, which captures
long relationships through pairwise dot products, has notably ben-
efited SR. However, prevailing research in this domain faces three
significant challenges: (i) Existing studies directly adopt the pri-
mary component of Transformer (i.e., the self-attention mechanism),
without a clear explanation or tailored definition for its specific
role in SR; (ii) The predominant focus on pairwise computations
overlooks the global context or relative prevalence of item pairs
within the overall sequence; (iii) Transformer primarily pursues
relevance-dominated relationships, neglecting another essential
objective in recommendation, i.e., diversity. In response, this work
introduces a fresh perspective to elucidate the attention mecha-
nism in SR. Here, attention is defined as dependency interactions
among items, quantitatively determined under a global probabilistic
model by observing the probabilities of corresponding item subsets.
This viewpoint offers a precise and context-specific definition of
attention, leading to the design of a distinctive attention mecha-
nism tailored for SR. Specifically, we transmute the well-formulated
global, repulsive interactions in Determinantal Point Processes
(DPPs) to effectively model dependency interactions. Guided by the
repulsive interactions, a theoretically and practically feasible DPP
kernel is designed, enabling our attention mechanism to directly
consider category/topic distribution for enhancing diversity. Conse-
quently, the Probabilistic Attention mechanism (PAtt) for sequential
recommendation is developed. Experimental results demonstrate
the excellent scalability and adaptability of our attention mecha-
nism, which significantly improves recommendation performance
in terms of both relevance and diversity.

1 Introduction
Sequential recommendation (SR) has garnered considerable atten-
tion due to its alignment with real-world recommendation scenar-
ios, where its primary objective is to provide users with content that
caters to their interests through modeling their historical behavior.
This heightened emphasis on SR has been substantially propelled by
the success of the Transformer framework, which aims to capture
long-range relationships utilizing pairwise dot products.
However, challenges still persist in this domain: (Cl1) While
prior studies have explored various interpretations of attention con-
cept in SR, including notions like influence [ 18,23,30], dependency
[54,62,66], correlations [ 24,67], and context [ 26,50]. While these
ambiguous interpretations are believed to significantly advance
sequential recommendation (SR), there remains a lack of specific
SR-tailored definitions and formalization. This lack of clarity im-
pedes a profound understanding and potential improvements; (Cl2)
Figure 1 reveals that the self-attention mechanism relies on pair-
wise dot products between a single item and all other items within
the sequence to connect the entire sequence. This approach, in
practice, fails to consider the relationships across different item
pairs and how they are distributed in a specific manner within the
sequence, i.e., the pairwise context; (Cl3) In the field of recom-
mender systems, it is common for data to exhibit sparsity [ 20,31],
often leading to short sequences. Traditional self-attention excels
in modeling long-range relationships, which may not have a com-
petitive advantage in addressing this inherent sparsity issue [ 65];
(Cl4) Existing research often allocates attention within a sequence
based on item similarity, where higher similarity implies greater

values of mutual attention weight. However, this approach could
result in a system that tends to suggest monotonous items, thereby
compromising diversity performance.
The recognition of challenges (Cl1-Cl3) has led us to explore a
novel perspective, namely, the use of global probabilistic models to
assign attention distribution within a sequence. This perspective
offers several advantages: (i) It enables a formal definition of at-
tention as a probability distribution, providing a robust foundation
for the formulization and interpretation of attention concept; (ii)
Global probabilistic models that derive probabilities (attentions)
from a holistic viewpoint, extending beyond individual item pairs
(global context); (iii) Probability modeling accommodates distri-
butions over subsets of varying sizes. This enhances the ability
of attention-based SR to effectively leverage limited information,
which is crucial in addressing the frequently encountered challenge
of sparse data in recommendation systems.
To explore this perspective, we consider the potential utility
of Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), which offer promising
techniques for modeling global, repulsive interactions. By transmut-
ing the well-established repulsive interactions, the dependency
interactions among items can be readily derived, thus contribut-
ing to the explicit definition of attention in SR. In this definition,
item attentions represent dependency interactions among items,
where higher attention weights correspond to stronger dependen-
cies across items. The degree of these interactions is qualified by
the probability of the corresponding item subset being distributed
as a DPP. Furthermore, in line with the critical characteristic of
DPPs in measuring diversity, we can bring about the fourth advan-
tage by introducing the concept of category/topic scope-related
diversity into the attention distribution, thus mitigating the risk of
monotonous recommendations (Cl4).
Based on this perspective, we develop Probabilistic Attention
(PAtt) tailored for sequential recommendation. As Figure 1 depicts,
themutual attention between two items within a sequence 𝑆is
formulated as the probability of drawing both of them from ground
setY(𝑆). This work aims to explore four research questions based
on the novel perspective: (RQ1) Given that the attention degree is
quantified based on the probability of a subset, and there are no
restrictions on the number of items within a subset, can we inferthat as the number of items involved in subsets increases, which
implies more intricate dependency patterns are considered, the final
recommendation performance improves? (RQ2) Considering our
proposal of a substantially different attention definition from the
original one, is it necessary for us to adhere to the complex setting of
Query-Key-Value structures? (RQ3) What impact does existing self-
attention of pairwise context have on diversity, and can we enhance
recommendation diversity through the design of global probabilistic
attention distribution? (RQ4) Can our PAtt be considered a more
suitable attention mechanism for sparse environments?
The main contributions of this work are:
•We introduce a novel perspective of employing global prob-
abilistic models to allocate attention distribution within a
sequence. This approach allows us to mathematically and
empirically define and elucidate the attention mechanism
within the specific domain of sequential recommendation.
•Unlike conventional self-attention that requires the Query-
Key-Value setting, our probabilistic attention mechanism
relies solely on a Sampler. Remarkably, it achieves superior
performance with significantly fewer parameters.
•Two crucial properties of our dependency-defined attention
mechanism are validated: (i) Dependencies are mutual, with-
out inherent ordering; (ii) As the number of items involved
in dependency interactions increases, the recommendation
performance improves.
•We incorporate the standard and category scope-related DPP
kernels to formulate a novel kernel whose capability to pro-
mote recommendation diversity has been empirically and
mathematically demonstrated.

Self-attention Mechanism. The rational allocation of attention
flow plays a crucial role in modeling long-range relationships for
self-attention. Efforts in existing literature have primarily focused
on four key approaches to achieve such rational allocation: (i) Some
studies compute Wasserstein distances [ 11] or relative distances
[16] between elements within a sequence, and utilize these distances
as attention weights; (ii) Some approaches treat the attention graph
as a flow network, allowing for the derivation of attention flow
[1,63]; (iii) In certain methods, softmax is considered a kernel and
connected with other kernels, such as the Gaussian kernel, as a
means to calculate attention weight matrices; (iv) Hybrid attention
[42,57] and sharing attention mechanisms [ 52] are employed to
more efficiently compute the attention flow. Furthermore, given
that self-attention inherently lacks explicit modeling of relative
or absolute position information, the introduction of additional
information during attention weight computation is a common
practice. This additional information includes factors such as edge
information [ 41], time intervals [ 30], and contextual signals [ 37,59].
It is worth noting that the current approaches for calculating
attention weights predominantly operate in a pairwise context. To
date, there is a lack of research employing global probabilistic mod-
els to allocate attention flow in a more holistic manner.
Sequential Recommendation Models. The implementation of
SR primarily relies on sequential models to predict the relevance be-
tween the previous sequence and the target items. An early method
used for SR is the Markov Chain (MC) [ 8,20], which operates under
 
1957Probabilistic Attention for Sequential Recommendation KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
the assumption that a user’s next action can be predicted based on
their recent actions. SR models that employ Convolutional neural
network (CNN) treat the sequence embedding matrix as an image
and apply convolutional operators to it [ 44,58]. On the other hand,
Recurrent neural network (RNN)-based methods enable the capture
of longer-term semantics and take the order of the sequence into ac-
count, leading to performance improvements [ 3,40,56]. Currently,
self-attention based models have taken a dominant role in the field
of SR. The pioneering work that introduces self-attention into se-
quential recommendation is [ 26]. Subsequently, numerous efforts
have been made to incorporate sequence order information [ 30,33]
and context [ 23,48] into the attention mechanism to enhance per-
formance. Furthermore, the integration of self-attention with other
sequential models, including contrastive learning [ 39,53,60], graph
neural networks [ 22,55,61], CNN [ 6,25], and RNN [ 32,51], has
been frequently adopted to utilize each other’s strengths in the
pursuit of improved SR performance.
DPP for Recommendation. DPPs are elegant probabilistic mod-
els known for efficiently capturing global negative correlations
through algorithms for tasks like sampling and marginalization.
Leveraging DPPs to diversify recommendations often involves de-
signing efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. Subsets
of items, with the potential to spark user interest, are generated
based on the quality vs.diversity decomposition of the DPP kernel
through these methods [ 17,49]. Learning DPP kernel parameters
from historical interactions and using them as item representations
is also a common approach [ 13,47]. Furthermore, DPPs are fre-
quently combined with other popular models, such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ 49], bilateral branch networks [ 34],
reinforcement learning [ 35], and CNN [ 2], among others. These
collaborations aim to enhance the quality of recommendations by
incorporating diverse perspectives and methodologies.
Currently, there has been no attempt in the literature to interpret
and apply the DPP probability distribution as attention flow.
3 Methodology
In this section, we first provide relevant preliminaries and then
introduce our probabilistic attention.
3.1 Preliminaries
The relevant preliminaries include: SR problem formulation, SR-
tailored self-attention mechanism, and the standard DPP model.
3.1.1 Problem Formulation. Let sets of users and items be denoted
byUandV, with|U|and|V|indicating their respective sizes.
In sequential recommendation, user 𝑢’s chronologically ordered
interaction sequence is denoted S𝑢=[𝑣𝑢
1,𝑣𝑢
2,...,𝑣𝑢
|S𝑢|], where𝑣𝑢
𝑡
specifies the item interacted with at time step 𝑡and|S𝑢|indicates
the sequence length. The objective of SR is to match the next item
in a sequence, formally, 𝑝(𝑣𝑢
|S𝑢|+1=𝑣|S𝑢), by recommending a
top-N list of items.
3.1.2 Self-attention Mechanism. Since a new attention mechanism
is proposed as our sequence encoder, we introduce traditional self-
attention before presenting ours. The self-attention mechanism
inherently presumes that while items in sequences are correlated,
they bear varied significance to items at different sequence positions.
For a user’s action sequence S𝑢and a maximal sequence length𝑇, the sequence is either truncated by eliminating initial items if
|S𝑢|>𝑛or padded with zeros, resulting in 𝑆=(𝑠1,𝑠2,...,𝑠𝑇). We
define an item embedding matrix E∈R|V|×𝑑, where𝑑indicates
the latent dimensions number. A trainable positional embedding
P∈R𝑇×𝑑is appended to the sequence embedding matrix as:
MS𝑢=[e𝑠1+p𝑠1,e𝑠2+p𝑠2,...,e𝑠𝑛+p𝑠𝑛]. (1)
Utilizing dot-product calculations, self-attention discerns correla-
tions between sequence items as follows:
SA(Q,K,V)=softmaxQK⊤
√
𝑑
V, (2)
with Q=MS𝑢WQ,K=MS𝑢WK, and V=MS𝑢WV. In this Query-
Key-Value attention mechanism, Q,K, and Vare derived from the
input, through learnable weight matrices. They serve to establish
attention scores by comparing the query with all keys, and then
determine the weighting and subsequent aggregation of values,
to form a contextually enriched output. Other Transformer com-
ponents, such as the point-wise feed-forward network, residual
connection, and layer normalization, are also usually leveraged in
self-attention-based SR models [11, 26].
3.1.3 Standard DPP. DPP measures set diversity by describing the
probability for all subsets of the ground set [ 28]. Given a discrete
setY={1,2,...,𝑀}(i.e., item setVin this work), a DPP Pis a
probability measure on 2Y, the set of all subsets of Y. WhenP
gives nonzero probability to the empty set, there exists a kernel
L∈R𝑀×𝑀such that for every subset 𝑌⊆Y, the probability of 𝑌
is given by
P(𝑌)=det(L𝑌)
det(L+I), (3)
where Lis a real, positive semi-definite matrix indexed by elements
of𝑌, and Iis an𝑀×𝑀identity matrix.
3.2 Probabilistic Attention
In a standard DPP (Equation 3), every subset of Yis assigned a
probability, even empty set and the entire Y. This standard DPP
is not desirable in practical scenarios that need fixed-size result
arrays [ 28]. Given this situation, an extension of DPP, i.e.,𝑘-DPP
[27], has been proposed, which conditions a DPP on the cardinality
𝑘of the random set.
3.2.1 Sequence-specified 𝑘-DPP. Compared to a standard DPP,
where every 𝑘-set𝑌competes with all other subsets of Y, in a
𝑘-DPP it competes only with sets of the same cardinality. In this
work,𝑘-DPP is explored to shape attention distribution, primarily
for the following reasons: (i) As depicted in Figure 1, we interpret
attention as the intensity of dependency among items. Therefore,
considering the probability of a single item or an empty set is not
meaningful and, conversely, would distract the global allocation of
probabilities; (ii) Measuring the dependency among items within
subsets of the same size and utilizing this to allocate attention is a
rational and equitable approach.
If we directly model a 𝑘-DPP model over the ground set of the
entire item set (i.e., V), and then learn to distribute probabilistic
attention, two issues will arise: (i) The computational burden is
pronounced due to the necessity of a DPP kernel L∈R|V|×|V|;
(ii) The attention flow is incapable of reflecting the uniqueness
embedded in varied user behavior sequences. Considering that the

global context of attention involves allocating attention in align-
ment with the pattern throughout the entire sequence, we therefore
build a𝑘-DPP for each sequence on the sequence-specified kernel,
denoted as L(𝑆), which is defined over ground set Y(𝑆)composed
of sequence items. It means that our global probabilistic 𝑘-DPP
model selectively learns the unique attention distribution for each
sequence. Formally, the 𝑘-DPPP𝑘

where|𝑌|=𝑘. The normalization constant in the denominator
indicates the summation over all subsets of size 𝑘, presenting a
distinct contrast to the standard DPP where the denominator (of
Equation 3) sums over all possible subsets, regardless of their size.
This normalization constant enables us to associate the subset 𝑌
and all other 𝑘-subsets within a 𝑘-DPP distribution (global context),
which is formulated as
𝑍𝑘=∑︁
|𝑌′|=𝑘det
L(𝑆)

=𝑒𝑘
𝜆1,𝜆2,...,𝜆|S𝑢|
. (5)
Here𝜆1,𝜆2,...,𝜆|S𝑢|are the eigenvalues of L(𝑆)with|S𝑢|items.
The recursive algorithm given in [ 14,28] can be used directly to cal-
culate the𝑘th elementary symmetric polynomial 𝑒𝑘on𝜆1,𝜆2...,𝜆|S𝑢|,
which runs in 𝑂(|S𝑢|𝑘)time. Thus, we can efficiently normalize
a tailored𝑘-DPP with a sequence ground set in 𝑂(|𝑠𝑢|𝑘)time to
model global repulsion interactions.
3.2.2 Dependency Interactions. This𝑘-DPP probability serves as a
quantitative measure of repulsion interactions (diversity) among
items in subset 𝑌[15,27,28]. In a novel approach, transmuting
this repulsion measure by taking its negative can mathematically
symbolize a converse concept; that is, it suggests a degree of depen-
dency among items within a set. For instance, given two subsets,
𝐴and𝐵, each containing 𝑘items, we examine their respective 𝑘-
DPP probabilities,P𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐴)andP𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐵). A conditionP𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐴)>
P𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐵)suggests that subset 𝐴demonstrates stronger repulsion
interactions among its items compared to subset 𝐵. In contrast,
considering the negation of probabilities, −P𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐵)>−P𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐴),we infer that items in subset 𝐵exhibit stronger dependency in-
teractions than those in subset 𝐴. To articulate the distinction
between repulsion and dependency, we introduce D(𝑆)
𝐴, signifying
the dependency degree among items in subset 𝐴under sequence
context𝑆, defined asD(𝑆)
𝐴=−P𝑘
L(𝑆)(𝐴). When𝑘is set to 2, the rel-
ative strength of repulsion between any two items under the global
measure L(𝑆)can be determined, which corresponds to the proba-
bility of being sampled by the 2-DPP model. Thus, the necessity to
quantify the dependency interactions between any paired items in
a sequence becomes a matter of the sampling process. Specifically,
the transmuted probability of sampling any two items is quantified
as dependency interactions between them, as illustrated in the dual
sampling of Figure 2. In such a scenario, we obtain a dual depen-
dency defined within a global probability context. Similarly, we
can obtain triple, or even quadruple, dependency.
3.2.3 Probabilistic Attention Mechanism. Reflecting upon Equa-
tion 2 within the self-attention mechanism, the attention weight
matrix is obtained by performing a softmax transformation on the
attention weight vector of an item with respect to all other items in
the sequence. Fundamentally, this transformation is still in pairwise
context, as it allocates attentions of one item onto all others, rather
than deriving the relative relationships of all pairs of items from a
global measure. According to Equation 2, the attention weight of
traditional self-attention is calculated as:
A𝑟𝑡=Q𝑟K⊤
𝑡/√
𝑑, (6)
where A𝑟𝑡is typically interpreted as the influence (weight) of posi-
tion𝑟on position𝑡in the sequence [ 46] or the relationship (similar-
ity) between positions 𝑟and𝑡[41]. However, this pairwise context
approach is not optimized for sequential recommendation tasks.
In the previous discussion, we drew upon the motivations and al-
gorithms of DPP to define the dependency interactions. Here, we
formulate the dependency attention weight based on the degree
of dual dependency interactions using a simple log-linear model,
D𝑟𝑡=exp
−𝜆P2
L(𝑆)({𝑣𝑟,𝑣𝑡})
, (7)
where𝜆governs the range of the dependency degree. P2
L(𝑆)denotes
a𝑘-DPP distribution(𝑘=2)with kernel L(𝑆)over 2-sized subsets
of a sequence.P2
L(𝑆)({𝑣𝑟,𝑣𝑡})signifies the probability of items 𝑣𝑟
and𝑣𝑡(𝑟≠𝑡) being selected from Y(𝑆)as a 2-DPP under global
measure (global context). This dependency attention approach we
proposed differs notably from the self-attention weight, which em-
bodies the mutual dependency between any two items. This is
driven by the desire to model dependency interactions from train-
ing sequences, hence capturing dependency relationships between
previous actions and the next item, which is paramount to the
realization of sequential recommendation [4, 7, 56].
While we have defined this dependency attention measurement,
an important remaining question is how to devise our DPP kernel
L(𝑆)∈R𝑇×𝑇, where𝑇is the maximum sequence length. To bridge
the input from the input layer with the learnable kernel parameters,
we employ a low-rank factorization of the 𝑇×𝑇L(𝑆)matrix:
L(𝑆)=SS⊤. (8)
Here, S∈R𝑇×𝑑is transformed by S=MS𝑢WS.WSis a trainable
projection matrix, serving essentially as the learnable parameters
 
1959Probabilistic Attention for Sequential Recommendation KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
in kernel L(𝑆). Because our attention intuitively measures the de-
pendency interactions between items, we seek to preserve these
relationships as much as possible. Consequently, we discard the
transformed Value matrix from the self-attention mechanism, di-
rectly applying the attention to the item’s input representation
MS𝑢. In this setting, only a transformed representation matrix Sis
required to capture contextual information in a sequence. In view
of the DPP sampling operations, we denote SasSampler. Thus,
our probabilistic attention based on the dependency measurement
is formulated as
Z=PAtt(S)=DMS𝑢. (9)
Ddenotes the attention weight matrix of our proposed PAtt for
sequenceS𝑢, derived by (i) computing the exponential values of
the dependency interaction degree across entire 2-sized subsets,
and (ii) allocating all these values to corresponding matrix entries,
based on the positions of paired items in S𝑢.Zis the output of our
attention. It is worth noting that within the DPP subset, there is
inherently no ordering, implying that the dependency interactions
are mutual. That is, corresponding dependency attention weight
matrix exhibits a symmetrical relationship as illustrated in Figure 2.
However, due to the causality nature of sequences and to avoid con-
sidering future information [ 26,46] in prediction, we only consider
the lower triangular part of Dmatrix in practice. For the depen-
dency of an item with itself, we consider it absolute and hence
set the diagonal elements of the attention weight matrix to 1. We
can find that PAtt breaks away from the intricate Query-Key-Value
mechanism of self-attention, necessitating only a Sampler.
3.2.4 Diversity-aware Attention. In recommendation systems, the
diversity metric is utilized to assess the scope of categories or topics
within a recommended sequence; a broader scope indicates more
diverse recommendations [ 49,64]. However, PAtt introduced above
and existing self-attention based models [ 11,26,53] do not account
for diversity, which might affect the exhibition of diversified re-
sults under the guidance of relevance sequences. Therefore, in this
section, we endeavor to directly integrate the concept of diver-
sity into the attention mechanism, developing a diversity-aware
probabilistic attention model, termed DPAtt.
To achieve this, a new DPP kernel form, denoted as T(𝑆), inte-
grates the standard DPP kernel L(𝑆)and a category scope-related
kernel C. As previously discussed, L(𝑆)is given over the sequence-
specified ground set because we aim to model the dependency inter-
actions of user sequences, thus inheriting relevance. The concept of
category scope-related diversity does not bear relevance or person-
alization; therefore, it is necessary to derive C∈R|V|×|V|over the
entire ground setV. To reduce the computational complexity of
calculating a|V|×|V| matrix, the Ckernel is represented using a
low-rank factorization C=V⊤Vfollowing [ 13]. We use diversified
item sets (subsets that have a broad coverage) from users’ historical
interactions as ground truth sets for learning C[36,49]. In this way,
Cis associated with the item category scope, as a subset with more
categories has a higher possibility of being selected under a DPP
compared to the less diverse ones. Formally, Cis learned following
the objective function,
J=∑︁
(𝐴+,𝐴−)∈Alog det(C𝐴+)−log det(C𝐴−). (10)Here,𝐴(+)is an observed diverse set and 𝐴(−)represents the set
that contains negative items, and Adenotes the set of paired sets
used for training. Cis not related to sequence, as it is only the
category scope-related kernel.
T(𝑆)is then given making use of the following relationship:
T(𝑆)=L(𝑆)C−1
S𝑢. (11)
C−1
S𝑢denotes the reverse of matrix CS𝑢that is a sub-matrix of C
indexed by items in sequence S𝑢. Given a DPP distribution formu-
lated with kernel T(𝑆), a crucial property is introduced: an increase
in category scope reduces the probabilities of related subsets, and
subsequently enhances attention weights derived from the negation
of these probabilities Equation 7. This implies that the composite
kernel T(𝑆), by influencing the DPP probability distribution, can
strike a balance between dependency interactions and diversity,
ensuring subsets with strong dependency relationships and ample
diversity receive notable attention weights. The proof of this pro-
posed proposition is provided in Appendix A.1, and its validation
is discussed in Section 4.2.
3.2.5 Triple Dependency. Given that we define the attention weight
as the dependency interactions within a subset, an intuitive concept
emerges: the dependency interactions, when formulated to involve
more items, should enable our attention mechanism to harness bet-
ter modeling capability, thereby enhancing SR performance. This
is because, in the field of SR, a model enhances its performance
precisely by augmenting its capacity to capture and model complex
dependency relationships among items. [ 10,36]. This perspective
also reveals a limitation of self-attention, in that the calculation of
attention weight only involves two items, neglecting the considera-
tion of combinations involving three or more items. The previously
introduced PAtt only considers dependency between two items,
which may not be sufficient. In this section, we analyze from a prob-
abilistic perspective and design a method that introduces richer
dependencies into the attention distribution.
Initially, we consider the situation of triple items. By setting 𝑘=3,
we can easily obtain the DPP probabilities of subsets with three
items, denoted asP3
L(𝑆). Subsequently, the core challenge lies in
how to apply these probabilities to the computation of dependency
attention weight matrix. By perceiving the marginal probability
of dual items as a marginalization over a joint probability, we can
derive a richer dependency mapping, formally,
P2
L(𝑆)({𝑣𝑟,𝑣𝑡})=∑︁
𝑥P3
L(𝑆)({𝑣𝑟,𝑣𝑡,𝑣𝑥}). (12)
Here,({𝑣𝑟,𝑣𝑡,𝑣𝑥})represents any 3-subset in a sequence, which
includes𝑣𝑟and𝑣𝑡. As demonstrated in Figure 2, since this approach
formulates DPP of 3-sized item subsets and ultimately models triple
dependency interactions, we refer to it as triple PAtt, abbreviated
as PAtt3. For consistency in representation, the previously discussed
dual PAtt is denoted as PAtt2. We can also derive the diversity-aware
attention corresponding to triple PAtt, represented as DPAtt3. With
this explicit formulation of triple dependency, we can introduce
more dependency learning to capture more complex behavior pat-
terns. Moreover, referring to this method, we can also introduce
dependency interactions among even more items, illustrating the
extensibility of our attention method.

It is noteworthy that, analogous to the self-attention mechanism,
our probabilistic attention can also be configured with multiple
heads and attention blocks.
3.3 PAtt Calculation
3.3.1 Matrix Form Calculation. We can directly enumerate all com-
binations of 𝑇items of a sequence taken 𝑘at a time, resulting in
a total of𝐶(𝑇,𝑘)combinations. These combinations, which store
positions of items within a sequence and thus remain invariant
throughout all training sequences, signify complete subsets with
cardinality𝑘. Every combination comprising 𝑘sequence positions
forms a𝑘-subset. Given a batch of training sequence inputs, we
can acquire a batch of DPP kernels with shape (batch_size,𝑇,𝑇)
referring to Equation 8. The subsequent step involves slicing cor-
responding sub-matrices from each kernel according to 𝑘posi-
tions in the combinations, i.e., obtaining each L(𝑆)
𝑌associated with
all subsets within every sequence ground set Y(𝑆), with shape
(batch_size,𝐶(𝑇,𝑘),𝑘,𝑘). Calculating the determinant of each sub-
matrix in the batch-sized square matrices yields the correspond-
ingdet(L𝑌)values for all subsets, with the resultant shape being
(batch_size,𝐶(𝑇,𝑘)). As we have selected all 𝑘-subsets from each
sequence ground set, directly summing the det(·)results for the
𝐶(𝑇,𝑘)subsets provides the normalization constant. Consequently,
it is not required to employ recursive algorithms from Equation 5 to
ascertain the normalization constant. Upon obtaining the normal-
ized DPP probabilities, we can arrange the batch-sized 𝐶(𝑇,𝑘)prob-
abilities into a batch of identity matrices whose diagonal entries are
1 and the other entries are 0. Firstly, we secure the lower triangular
matrix indices of the identity matrix, and subsequently populate the
relevant entries with corresponding probabilities. Specifically, the
positions of paired items (within each subset) in a sequence directly
correspond to the entry indices in the identity matrix. Through the
aforementioned methodology, we can accomplish the derivation of
the probabilistic attention matrix Dat the batch level.
3.3.2 Complexity Analysis. Our PAtt, analogous to existing self-
attention based SR models like SASRec [ 26] and STOSA [ 11], also
employs transformer structures, including the embedding layer,
point-wise feed-forward network, residual connection, and layer
normalization. This means that PAtt overall requires fewer param-
eters (reducing the parameter count by 2×𝑑2) compared to other
related models, due to our exclusive need for a single transformed
Sampler instead of using all Query, Key, and Value. In regards to
time complexity, while the dominant term in SASRec and STOSA
resides in the softmax computation, i.e.,𝑂(𝑇2𝑑), our method is
predominantly influenced by the complexity associated with the
calculation of DPP probabilities for subsets. The complexity for a 𝑘-
sized subset equates to 𝑂(𝑘3). Considering that we typically require
a minor𝑘value, such as 2 or 3, the computational complexity is not
high. However, variations in sequence length can have a significant
impact. If the maximum length, 𝑇, is set relatively large, the number
of𝑘-subsets could potentially prevail the dominant position in com-
plexity calculation. Considering the state-of-the-art SR work and
accounting for the sparsity of SR, the maximum length is usually
set to 20, 30, or 50 [ 30,31,53]. Thus, globally, our method exhibits
complexity comparable to traditional self-attention mechanisms.
Furthermore, when 𝑘=3and presuming 𝑇=30, we identify
𝐶(30,3)(4060) 3-subsets. Each attention weight D𝑟𝑡is defined byTable 1: Statistics of the datasets.

the summation of joint probabilities across 28 3-sized subsets that
contain items 𝑣𝑟and𝑣𝑡, thus presenting a steep complexity of
𝐶(30,3)×33, surpassing 302×32(with𝑑=32). To mitigate this
issue in practical computation, we do not compute all the 3-subsets
corresponding to an attention weight D𝑟𝑡. Rather, we randomly
select 4 of the 28 combinations, meaning that the marginalization
of an attention weight transpires over the joint probabilities of 4
arbitrary subsets containing 𝑣𝑟and𝑣𝑡. This culminates in a compu-
tational complexity of: 𝐶(30,2)×4×33, implies that, among the
total𝐶(30,2)2-subsets, each one is composed of the probabilities
of four 3-subsets. This approach yields a time complexity compara-
ble to the dominant term of the traditional self-attention-based SR
model SASRec.
4 Experiments
In this section, comprehensive experimental comparisons and anal-
yses are conducted to address the four research questions (RQ1-4)
posed in Section 1. The code and datasets relevant to this study are
available at https://github.com/l-lyl/PAtt.
4.1 Experimental Settings
4.1.1 Datasets. We select four widely-utilized real-world datasets
to evaluate the proposed probabilistic attention, which is offered
in two forms: one relevance-focused version (PAtt2and PAtt3) and
the other being diversity-aware (DPAtt2and DPAtt3). Each dataset
presents notably different category numbers and matrix densities
concerning implicit interactions. The Amazon-review1dataset
[21], encompasses a vast corpus of product ratings, from which we
specifically select Beauty andCDs products. Both Anime2andML-
1M3[19] datasets offer ratings on anime and movies, containing
43 and 18 categories, respectively. In alignment with conventional
practices as seen in [ 26,53,67], all numeric ratings are transmuted
into implicit feedback marked as 1. To refine the data, we exclude
users and items that have fewer than 10 interactions. Statistics for
all datasets are provided in Table 1.
4.1.2 Evaluation Metrics. We employ the widely-utilized leave-one-
out evaluation strategy [ 26,53]. For every user, the last item with
which they interacted is held out for testing, and the penultimate
item is utilized for validation, with the remainder used for train-
ing. Our evaluation of PAtt and baselines hinges on three strands
of metrics: (i ) two accuracy-oriented metrics, namely, Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain, i.e., NDCG (ND) and Recall (Re), (ii )
two prevalent and intuitive diversity metrics, Category Coverage
(CC) [ 38,49] and intra-list distance (ILD) [ 38,64], and (iii ) ahar-
monic F-score metric (F1) which harmonizes quality (accuracy)
and diversity [ 9,34]. We select 𝑁∈{5,20}for evaluation, allowing
us to assess the model’s robustness through both small and large
retrieval sizes, covering varied retrieval contexts.

4.1.3 Baselines. Nine prevalent state-of-the-art baselines in the SR
field are selected for comparison with four PAtt based models. They
fall into four groups: (i) CNN based model, Caser [2]; (ii) GNN
based model, GC-SAN [55]; (iii) models that utilize contrastive
learning (CL), CL4SRec [53] and DuoRec [39]; (iv) self-attention
based SR models, SASRec [26], BERT4Rec (BERT) [ 43],STOSA
[11], MOJITO (MOJ) [ 45], and STRec [29]; Further information on
baselines and implementation details is given in Appendix A.2.
4.2 Comparisons
The overall performance comparison between four PAtt based mod-
els and nine baselines w.r.t. three types of metrics on four datasets
is presented in Table 2, in which the best performance among all
methods is highlighted in bold, while the highest-performing base-
line is distinguished with an underline . Additionally, the percentage
(denoted by %) in parentheses () represents the improvement of
our specific model over the top-performing baseline. Based on the
comparison, we can make the following main observations:
•The recently proposed methods based on self-attention (STRec
and MOJ), as well as DuoRec based on CL, dominate the accuracy-
related metrics among all baselines. Four methods based on PAtt
we proposed show significant advantages compared to these
three competitive baselines, with improvements exceeding 5% in
most cases. This demonstrates the uniqueness and effectiveness
of our probabilistic attention.
•The PAtt3method, which introduces triple dependency inter-
actions into attention, performs better than PAtt2, which di-
rectly considers the paired items’ dependency degree as attention
weight. This result can answer two research questions (RQ1 and
RQ2), because: (i) We define attention as dependency interac-
tions, making the attention weight not limited to calculations
involving only two items, but can introduce more items into the
dependency attention measurement. Combined with correspond-
ing results, it can be concluded that the more comprehensive
the dependency interactions considered during the learning of
attention distribution, the stronger the predictive capacity of the
model (RQ1); (ii) Both PAtt3and PAtt2utilize the Sampler setting
and yield favorable outcomes, signifying that our probabilistic at-
tention can deviate from the Query-Key-Value mechanism (RQ2).
In addition, the improvement brought about by triple dependency
also demonstrates the rationality of our definition of attention
as dependency interactions, as in extensive SR studies [ 10,36],
capturing more dependencies means better performance.
•Compared to SASRec and STRec baselines, which apply the tra-
ditional self-attention mechanism, our basic PAtt3and PAtt2
approaches have shown obvious advantages in terms of both
diversity and accuracy. This can answer RQ3 andRQ2 to some
extent. The deficiency of SASRec and STRec in diversity metrics
suggests that employing a similarity metric within a relevance-
guided pairwise context prompts the learned attention distri-
bution to allocate higher attention to analogous future items.
Consequently, this amplifies the prevalence of similar items in
predictions, thereby diminishing diversity (RQ3). Although the
diversity concept is not considered in PAtt3and PAtt2, they ex-
hibit notable performance in diversity metrics. This can be at-
tributed to our probabilistic attention, which is formulated by
articulating mutual dependency and coordinating the probabilitydistribution across all sequence subsets. This approach facilitates
a more thoughtful allocation of mutual attention at the global
context level. In addition, this intuitive comparison also validates
the effectiveness of our unique Sampler setting (RQ2).
•After incorporating the diversity-aware kernel, DPAtt2and DPAtt3
display a substantial improvement in diversity metrics while also
delivering strong performance in relevance. This outcome pro-
vides a comprehensive answer to RQ3, demonstrating that our
proposed model is capable of embedding the concept of cate-
gory scope-related diversity into the attention distribution, thus
effectively augmenting diversity. This also demonstrates the effi-
cacy of our proposed method of constructing a new type of DPP
kernel, T(𝑆), by integrating standard and category scope-related
kernels, further validating the proof of the crucial property of
the integrated kernel.
•When comparing the improvements achieved by PAtt methods
across various datasets, the improvements are notably more pro-
nounced on datasets with higher sparsity (e.g., Beauty and CDs).
This indicates that PAtt, through the incorporation of dependency
interactions in global context, is capable of thoroughly model-
ing previous information in the presence of data sparsity. By
extracting dependency interactions that fundamentally impact
SR, PAtt demonstrates its adaptability to situations characterized
by sparse data (RQ4).
As we focus on proposing a new attentive mechanism for SR
from a probabilistic perspective, instead of balancing the diversity
and accuracy of recommendations employing the quality vs.diver-
sity decomposition of DPP kernel. We therefore omit the DPP-based
diversity-promoting recommendation models in Table 2. To further
demonstrate our proposed model’s performance in balancing di-
versity and quality, three DPP-based SR models are employed for
comparison. Due to space constraints, the details of the implemen-
tations and results comparison are provided in Appendix Table 3,
where the advantages of our newly proposed kernel T(𝑆), which,
at the model level, comprehensively considers diversity and quality
(proved in Appendix A.1), are further examined.
4.3 Property Analysis
In this section, we delve further into research questions intimately
related to the characteristics of our probabilistic attention, particu-
larly w.r.t. attention setting (RQ2) and sparse data problem (RQ4).
Figure 3 is utilized to further respond to RQ2. Three basic vari-
ants of PAtt (dual dependency) are designed in reference to the
traditional Query-Key-Value attention mechanism, where the sym-
bols “+K”, “+V” and “+VK”, respectively denote the addition of
transformed key, value and both. Within these variants, we regard
Sampler as Query. The newly introduced Key is intended to enrich
the learning of the DPP kernel by considering the Key as a new low-
rank representation of the DPP kernel. Subsequently, the Key-based
and Sampler-based kernels are averaged. “+Value” implies that the
probabilistic attention is not directly applied to the sequential items’
input but to their transformed representations. Comparative results
of recall and NDCG w.r.t. different Top-N on two datasets reveal
that our succinct Sampler setting, well aligned with the DPP sam-
pling process, is the most prominent. This provides a more intuitive
answer to RQ2: utilizing Sampler to the implementation of PAtt
instead of pursuing a complex Query-Key-Value mechanism. From

Figure 3, we can observe that: (i) the “+K” variant performs the
poorest (but still better than SASRec), possibly because introducing
superfluous Key could interfere with the learning of the DPP kernel,
thereby weakening its ability to distribute probabilities for subsets
in the global context; (ii) The “+VK” variant, despite introducingmore weight parameters, does not perform well, indicating that
PAtt does not require redundant parameters to excessively match
the predictive task of SR.

methods. When the value of 𝑇is set to be small, items in the pre-
vious positions of the long sequence are truncated, which reduces
the number of feedbacks in datasets, resulting in further sparse
datasets. Analyzing the performance variations across different
methods in response to various 𝑇values provides a comprehensive
answer to RQ4. We select two representative self-attention-based
models, the seminal work SASRec and the recent STRec, for com-
parison with PAtt2and PAtt3. Our findings are as follows: (i) All
methods experience a certain enhancement with the increase of
𝑇, indicating the impact of sparsity (when 𝑇is small) on SR. Our
methods demonstrate a very significant advantage compared to the
two baselines, especially at 𝑇=5and𝑇=10. This suggests that
our probabilistic attention is more skilled at handling data sparsity
issues compared to other self-attention models; (ii) At 𝑇=30, our
methods outperform other baselines, even those at 𝑇=50. When
set to𝑇=20, they achieve results comparable to other baselines at
𝑇=30. This suggests that our methods pave the way for achieving
commendable recommendation results, even with limited previous
information, which highlights a significant advantage of PAtt.
In addition, we conduct a comparative analysis of the attention
weights heatmap learned by SASRec, PAtt2, and PAtt3, for the same
user of ML-1M in Figure 5. We observe that, in contrast to the rela-
tively scattered attention demonstrated by SASRec, both PAtt2and
PAtt3are more capable of capturing attention with a discernible
pattern. This indicates that leveraging probabilistic attention within
a global context enables the capture of complex dependency inter-
actions within the sequence, consequently enhancing performance.
Moreover, PAtt3that introduces triple dependency demonstrates a
capability to capture a broader range of behavior patterns compared
to PAtt2(only considers dual dependency), as evidenced by similar
attention weights encompassing more items. This underscores a
further validation of our proposed definition of dependency in-
teractions, and also elucidates why PAtt3outperforms PAtt2, as it
embraces a wider and richer set of dependencies.
The training efficiency of different models when handling vari-
ous maximum lengths 𝑇on two datasets (Anime and ML-1M) is alsocompared. We discover that when data is sparse ( 𝑇=5), the PAtt-
based models (PAtt2and PAtt3) require a similar amount of time per
epoch for training as SASRec. Although training efficiency tends to
decrease as𝑇increases, due to the increase in the number of subsets
related to probabilistic attention, it is important to acknowledge
that, in real-world recommendation applications, the number of
available previous sequences for users is inherently limited ( 𝑇=5
is usually set to 30 or 50 in existing studies [ 10,29,31,53]). Conse-
quently, this does not impede the utilization of PAtt. Even when
the number of items in the sequence is substantial, the training
time used by our PAtt2and PAtt3methods is on the same order of
magnitude as traditional self-attention models, while the relative
improvement in performance is indeed significant. Moreover, our
model, at𝑇=30, consumes close time to SASRec at 𝑇=50, while
significantly outperforming it in terms of accuracy. This balance
between efficiency and effectiveness highlights the robustness and
practicality of PAtt models, making them a preferable choice for
handling complex user behavioral sequences in dynamic recom-
mendation environments.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we delve into the intrinsic nature of sequential rec-
ommendation tasks, proposing a conceptualization of the potent
Transformer’s self-attention as mutual dependencies among items
within a sequence. To formulate these dependency interactions, we
transmute the well-formulated repulsion interactions from Deter-
minantal Point Processes (DPP) and, adopting a novel perspective,
envision the distribution of attention as probability allocations
within global DPP probabilistic models, thereby deriving an inno-
vative probabilistic attention model, PAtt. Remarkably, our model
steers clear of the traditional Query-Key-Value setup, achieving
commendable results with a mere Sampler. Furthermore, the con-
cept of dependency interactions, as defined at first, incorporates
associations among a greater number of items into the formulation
of attention weight, enhancing the model’s capacity to represent
sequences. We also design a novel DPP kernel, capable of integrat-
ing DPP kernels with varied inclinations and balancing different
tendencies (similarity and diversity), which is a departure from the
traditional quality vs.diversity decomposition of DPP kernel [ 28].
The introduction of this kernel affirms the extensibility of PAtt. By
providing precise definitions and formulations for new attention
models and architectures, PAtt stands to expand researchers’ under-
standing and development of the Transformer. The insights gained
from this work could serve as a foundation for developing more so-
phisticated models that further intertwine the notions of attention
and probabilistic modeling, paving the way for breakthroughs in
creating models that can understand and predict sequences with
higher accuracy and diversity. Expanding PAtt to cover additional
sequence analysis tasks is a key future research direction.

A Appendix
A.1 Diversity-aware Attention
Consider two independent positive semi-definite kernel matrices, L
andC, an integrated kernel T, and a subset 𝑌. For clarity, L,C, and
Trespectively represent L(𝑆),CS𝑢, and T(𝑆). We examine:P(𝑌)=det(T𝑌)
det(T+I)
=det(L𝑌)
det(C𝑌)/det
C−1(L+C)
=det(L𝑌)
det(C𝑌)/det(L+C)
det(C).(13)
The objective is to analyze the manner in which P(𝑌)evolves as
det(C𝑌)augments, with LandCheld as independent kernels.
Theorem A.1. Given independent kernels LandC,P(𝑌)dimin-
ishes as the category scope of 𝑌expands.
Proof. Consider the expression for P(𝑌):
P(𝑌)=det(L𝑌)
det(C𝑌)×det(C)
det(L+C)(14)
Firstly, observe that det(L𝑌)remains invariant for changes in
det(C𝑌)due to the presumed independence of matrices LandC.
Thus, an increment in det(C𝑌), while keeping det(L𝑌)constant,
will precipitate a reduction in the fractiondet(L𝑌)
det(C𝑌).
Secondly, the fractiondet(C)
det(L+C)remains unaffected by alterations
indet(C𝑌), thus holding constant with respect to changes in 𝑌.
Given these observations, it is evident that while the second
component of the expression retains its magnitude, the increase
indet(C𝑌)conduces a decrease in P(𝑌), as the first component
diminishes while the latter remains constant. In alignment with
the objective function described in Equation 10, when a subset 𝑌
is diverse, indicating a broad category scope, the corresponding
det(C𝑌)is consequently learned to be a larger value. Hence, it is
derived that an increase in category scope of the subset 𝑌reduces
the probability ofP(𝑌). Consequently, the corresponding attention
is augmented, as it takes the negation of the probability. □
A.2 Baselines and Implementations
We carry out the implementation of PAtt using PyTorch on a
NVIDIA Quadro P2000 GPU. A thorough grid search is undertaken
to examine all hyper-parameters across the compared methods,
with test performance reported based on peak validation results.
For all methods in consideration, the embedding dimension is ex-
plored within the set {32,64,128}. The maximum sequence length
of our models is examined from 5 to 50 for various analyses and
is set to 30 for all experiments, while the learning rate is adjusted
within
10−3,10−4	
. In addition, we investigated the dropout rate
within{0.3,0.5,0.7}and𝜆within{0.5,1.0,4.0,8.0,16.0}specifically
for PAtt. For methods grounded on self-attention, the number of
layers was explored within {1,2,3}, the number of heads within
{1,2,4}, the maximum sequence length within {30,50,100}for base-
lines. An early stopping strategy is applied, model optimization will
be ceased if NDCG@20 of validation does not exhibit improvement
for 10 consecutive epochs. Following is a detailed introduction and
hyper-parameter search ranges of the baselines:
•Caser4is proposed in [ 2], which aims to capture high-order
patterns by applying horizontal and vertical convolutional oper-
ations for sequential recommendation. We search the length 𝐿
from{5,10}, and𝑇from{1,3,5}.

•GC-SAN5[55] integrates GNN with a self-attention mechanism
to identify both local and long-range transitions of neighboring
items hidden within each interaction session. We tune weight
factor𝜔from 0.4 to 0.8.
•CL4SRec6[53] is the first work that incorporates CL into se-
quential recommendation based on the basic self-attention model.
We test the crop/mask/reorder proportion of items from 0.2 to
0.7 according to the experimental results of [53].
•DuoRec7[39] provides a model-level augmentation based on
Dropout to enable better semantic preserving and address the
representation degeneration problem. The scale weight 𝜆is chose
from{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5}.
•SASRec8[26] is a seminal sequential recommendation method
that depends on the self-attention mechanism. We search the
dropout rate from{0.3,0.5,0.7}.
•BERT4Rec9[43] employs a masked item training scheme, anal-
ogous to the masked language model sequential in NLP, using
the bi-directional self-attention mechanism as its backbone. We
tune the mask proportion 𝜌in{0.2,0.4,0.6}.
•STOSA10[11] is recently proposed, utilizing the difference be-
tween distributions as a substitute for the traditional attention

A.3 Experiments
Recommendation models leveraging DPP to enhance diversity are
often designed for traditional recommendation scenarios, as indi-
cated by [ 5,12,13,49]. A direct comparison with these models is
neither sufficient nor fair, given our method’s specific focus on
sequential recommendation. To address this, we not only consider
existing DPP-based models like PD-GAN [49] and CDSL [36] but
also introduce a newly designed model, AMAP. The implementa-
tion details are:
•PD-GAN utilizes DPP MAP to generate items for the discrimi-
nator in traditional recommendation systems. We initialize the
PD-GAN generator parameters using BPR matrix factorization,
adhering to the approach in the original work.
•AMAP, our proposed DPP-refined baseline based on SASRec,
employs the MAP generation approach from DPP [ 5] to select
recommendations, which is a departure from the conventional

method used in SASRec where recommendations are chosen
based on ranking items by their predicted relevance scores.
•CDSL [36] is a state-of-the-art DPP-based method for sequential
recommendation. It uses DPP likelihood to guide the learning pro-
cess for SR in balancing recommendations, and we have applied
this approach on the SASRec model.
In Table 3, F1 measurement is calculated based on NDCG and
CC. For these three baselines, the DPP kernel construction is based
on the standard quality (predicted relevance score) vs.diversity
(diverse kernel C) decomposition.
The above Table 3 offers observations:
•While PD-GAN shows some advantages in diversity in certain
scenarios, its NDCG scores are significantly lower compared
others. This illustrates that traditional recommendation models
based on DPP are not adequately equipped to handle tasks an-
ticipating dynamic preferences. It also underscores the rationale
behind our initiative to design new DPP-refined model AMAP,
tailored to meet these evolving requirements.
•When comparing AMAP and CDSL against their base model
SASRec (as shown in Table 2), it can be observed that the extent
of improvement in results is not significant. This suggests that the
performance of AMAP and CDSL is still largely constrained by
the underlying model, as these methods serve to adjust or guide
the base model to balance accuracy and diversity of suggestions,
rather than designing a new model.
Furthermore, we find that the three baselines, which utilize the
standard quality vs.diversity kernel, often experience a trade-off
where an increase in diversity comes at the cost of accuracy. How-
ever, the diversity-aware attention DPAtt excels in balancing accu-
racy and diversity aspects and achieves the best F1 performance.
This suggests that the existing quality vs.diversity DPP kernel is
less effective compared to our newly proposed composite kernel
in Equation 11 (detailed and mathematically analyzed in Appen-
dix A.1), which adopts a novel construction form. The composite
kernel T(𝑆)is directly applied in the probabilistic attention model
with the aim of balancing the dependency and category-aware di-
versity in attention distribution, rather than trading off accuracy
for diversity in MAP generation.
