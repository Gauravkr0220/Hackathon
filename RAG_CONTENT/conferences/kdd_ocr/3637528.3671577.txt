ABSTRACT
Predicting click-through rate (CTR) is a critical task in recommen-
dation systems, where the models are optimized with pointwise
loss to infer the probability of items being clicked. In industrialpractice, applications also require ranking items based on theseprobabilities. Existing solutions primarily combine the ranking-based loss, i.e.,pairwise and listwise loss, with CTR prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION
Click-throughrate (CTR)is theprobability ofa userclickingon a
recommended item. CTR prediction, which attempts to estimate
the CTR given a user-item impression accurately, is critical forachieving precise recommendations and increasing revenue forenterprises [
34,59]. Consequently, it plays a significant role in
recommendation systems, such as online advertising and in-game
player friend recommendations [18, 31, 32, 52, 55, 56, 61].
Inindustrialapplications,therearetwousecasesforCTRpre-
diction models: 1) forms an advertisement ranked list accordingto predicted CTR, and 2) calibrates click probabilities for down-
streamingrecommendationtasks.Forexample,insponsoredsearch,
thefinalpresentationtousersisarankedlistofads[ 27],andthe
calibrated scores produced is a required input for computing thecost-per-click (CPC)after ad impressions,which decides thepre-
sentationofanadbasedonathreshold[ 51].Therefore,thereisa
significant demand for a CTR prediction model that can align with
the actual click-through rate (i.e., calibration) and lead to a correct
ranking[43].Existingmethodscombinepairwiseandlistwisetrain-
ing in Learn-to-Rank (LTR) [ 7,33] with CTR predictions. Recent
works focus on enhancing ranking performance in CTR prediction
with pairwise and listwise methods. For example, Bayesian Person-
alized Ranking [ 40] and Smooth-AUC [ 47] leverage the pairwise
training.RegressionCompatibleRanking[ 3],ScaleCalibration[ 51],

CTR scenario is binary, the ratio of feasible pairs is strongly
affected by the positive item ratio and can be very sparse.
optimize models based on preference pairs ( e.g.,two items with dif-
ferentpreferencesforthesameuser),thepositiveratiowillstrongly
affect the number of feasible training pairs. We present a toy ex-
ample in Figure 1 with 𝑁items to better illustrate the situation.
Under the best condition, only half of the/parenleftbig𝑁
2/parenrightbigpossible pairs can be
constructed as the preference pairs, with the positive-item ratio be-ing50%.Furthermore,thepositivefeedback(userclicks)inthereal
world is highly sparse. For example, if only 10% are positive items,
there will be only 18% feasible pairs. Therefore, binary preference
restricts the effectiveness of existing methods for CTR predictions.
To address this issue, we propose the Beyond Binary Preference
(BBP) training framework. Our key idea is to augment training
labelswithcontinuousBayesianprobabilitytobreaktheties.We
treat the historical records as an observation sequence of Bernoulli
trails and calculate the estimated probability score for all users and
items through Bayesian smoothing [ 42]. Afterward, we combine
the probability score and binary feedback to break the ties andoptimize the model. Since the prior ranking score is continuous
ratherthanbinary,morepreferencepairsareconstructed,which
addresses the data sparsity caused by binary feedback. For jointoptimization of ranking and calibration. In particular, we designa multi-task learning framework with a global context ranking
lossthatreusesthearbitraryuser-itempairsinthesamebatchtoaugmentmorepreferencepairs.Extensiveofflineexperiments on
three public benchmark datasets and online A/B testing on two
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our BBP framework outper-
forms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitors in both ranking and
calibration capabilities.

•To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify and ad-

by binary preference feedback in CTR prediction.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 CTR Prediction
Pointwise training and calibration. CTR prediction usually op-
timizes the models with the Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss func-
tion; therefore its prediction scores strictly calibrate click proba-
bilities that an item on a website (such as an advertisement) willbe clicked [
13,38]. Existing methods study various model archi-
tectures for more accurate CTR prediction, including statistical
methods[ 12,48],logisticregression[ 36,41],factorizationmachines
[23,39],andDNNs-basedCTRmodels[ 8,14,15,20,29,59].How-
ever, pointwise training suffers from limited ranking performance,
resulting in sub-optimal recommendation outcomes. It is worth
mentioning that the calibration ability of CTR models can be con-
fused with a different research topic called “uncertainty calibra-
tion” [9,25]. In uncertainty calibration, the focus is on confidence
estimates rather than calibrating the model’s output with click
probabilities.
Ranking-basedCTRprediction .Inindustrialapplications,the
rankingabilityofCTRmodelsisalsocrucial[ 13,33],asweneed
to provide an advertisement ranked list for down-streaming rec-
ommendationtasks.RecentworkhasdemonstratedthattheCTR
models trained with pointwise loss suffer from limited rankingperformance [
3,44,47,51] due to a lack of preference ordering
information during the training. To address this issue, researchers
have proposed various pairwise and listwise approaches, which
differ from pointwise methods in that they directly optimize rank-
ing objectives. Pairwise methods compare pairs of items, while
listwisemethodsconsidertheentireimpressionlistofitemsforthe
user. These approaches aim to directly optimize ranking metrics
such as AUC (Area Under the Curve) [ 11] and NDCG (Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain) [ 21]. Bayesian Personalized Ranking
(BPR) [40] optimizes the order of pairs of positive and negative
items. Smooth-AUC (SAUC) loss introduces a smooth approxima-
tionofAUCusingasigmoidfunction.Thoughadvancedranking

calibration abilities by contrasting the logit value for samples with
different labels and constraining the predicted probability as the
logit subtraction. However, they overlooked the data sparsity due
to the ubiquitous ties (i.e., pairs with the same label will not be
used for training). In this paper, we propose the Beyond Binary
Preference(BBP)trainingframeworktoaddressthelimitationsofranking-based CTR training further.
2.2 Learning-to-rank with Ties
Learning-to-rank with ties has been a focus of research as it ad-dresses the issue of instances having nearly identical degrees of
relevance,referredtoas‘ties’[ 5].Therearetwolinesofresearch
to make full use of ties. One option is to force the model to output
similar predictions for items with the same label. Examples of this
approach include designing an extra loss function for the samerelevance [
60], re-ranking items with a given pairwise relevance
threshold [ 57], and using a hashing function for tie-aware ranking
[17], among others. The other option, in contrast, is to break the
tiesduring training by ensuring that no equal relevance exists. For
instance,uRank[ 62]overcomesthetieissueofexistingPlackett-
Luce models by maximizing the likelihood of selecting documents
with high ratings over documents with low ratings. Savant [ 26]

3 PRELIMINARIES
3.1 CTR Prediction
LetDbe an impression dataset. In CTR prediction, typically, each
sample in Dconsists of examples represented as tuples (𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑢,𝑣),
where𝑢∈UbeauserID, 𝑣∈VbeanitemID,and 𝑦𝑢,𝑣∈{0,1}
is the binary preference label, i.e.,user clicks. The CTR prediction
model𝑓aims to assign a score 𝑠to a user item pair (𝑢,𝑣)given
its feature vector x𝑢,𝑣,i.e.,𝑠𝑢,𝑣=𝑓(x𝑢,𝑣). The output 𝑠indicates
thelikelihoodthatuser 𝑢willclickitem 𝑣.Themodel 𝑓isusually
optimized from the following two aspects.
Calibration.Traditionally,thecalibratedCTRmodelislearnedand
evaluatedwithbinarypreferenceinthepointwisesetting[ 3,44].
The loss function in learning is defined on a single data point x𝑢,𝑣
of each user-item pair in dataset D. Formally, the empirical risk

Ranking . As discussed above, industrial applications also leverage
predictionscore 𝑓(𝑢,𝑣)torankthecandidateitems.TheCTRmodel
𝑓is still defined on a user-item pair (𝑢,𝑣), and the loss function
is defined on two data points x𝑢,𝑣andx𝑢,𝑣/primethat can formulate
preference judgement pairs [58].
Definition1(preferencejudgementpair). Formally,given
two items 𝑣and𝑣/primeto the same user 𝑢, a preference judgement pair
isdefinedas: (𝑢,𝑣)/follows(𝑢,𝑣/prime),where𝑦𝑢,𝑣isgreaterthan 𝑦𝑣,𝑣/prime.Inthe
contextofbinarypreference,itmeans 𝑣istheclickeditem,and 𝑣/primeis
unclicked by the user 𝑢.
Therefore, the empirical risk function Lrankis defined as:
Lrank=/summationdisplay.1
/angbracketleft(𝑢,𝑣)/follows(𝑢,𝑣/prime)/angbracketrightℓrank/parenleftBig
𝑠𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑢,𝑣,𝑠𝑢,𝑣/prime,𝑦𝑢,𝑣/prime/parenrightBig
,(2)
whereℓrank/parenleftBig
𝑠𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑢,𝑣,𝑠𝑢,𝑣/prime,𝑦𝑢,𝑣/prime/parenrightBig
denotes a pairwise loss function.
As the labels are binary, i.e.,click or not click, there will be a large
number ofties, as mentioned inSection 1. As tiescannot perform
preference judgments, existing methods usually drop them during
the training, which may lead to sub-optimal.
Inthiswork,weaddressthislimitationbybringinganaugmented
label to break the ties. Specifically, we model the click behaviors
andusetheoverallhistoricalCTRaspriorprobabilities.Withmore
impressionsobservedinthechronicsequence,wegraduallyupdate
user-item pair posterior probabilities with Bayesian Smoothing as
the augmented label.
3.2 Click Behavior Modeling
OurclickbehaviormodelisshowninFigure2:whenauserreceivesanimpression ofan item,theuser decidesto clickor notaccording
to his/her interest. Considering the binary nature of the click be-
havior, we treat each user-item impression as a Bernoulli trial withanunderlyingprobability
𝑟,i.e.,𝐶∼Binomial(𝐼,𝑟).Inaddition,the
underlying probability 𝑟that a user clicks an item follows a beta
distribution, i.e.,𝑟∼Beta(𝛼,𝛽).

Themeanofthedistribution 𝜇isdeterminedbytheratio 𝛼andthe

whereE[𝑟]reflects the expectation of the click probability for the
user-item pair. The conjugacy between Binomial and Beta enables

Ourgoalistoestimateacontinuousaugmentrankingscoretobreak
theubiquitousbinaryties.WefirstleverageBayesiansmoothing
to estimate the Bayesian probabilities according to the historicalobservations in Sec. 4.1. Furthermore, we combine the estimatedprobabilities with binary labels as augmented preference scores,
whichenablesustoextendthepreferencejudgmentpairsdefini-
tion in Sec. 4.2. Since the augmented score is continuous, it breaks
the ties from binary labels. Finally, we jointly optimize the rank-ingandcalibrationinamultitasklearningframeworkinSec.4.3.
Specifically, we design a global context ranking loss that compares
arbitrary user-item pairs instead of items for the same user, which
improves the model performance further.
4.1 Learning Beta Distribution for Click
Inference
WiththebehaviormodelinginSec.3.2,weaimtoestimatethebeta
distribution for the user behavior, which is used as the augmentlabel with Bayesian approaches. The main idea is to arrange the
historical datachronologically andgradually update thepersonal-
izedbetadistributionforeachuser(item)withBayesiansmoothing
from an initial distribution.
Dataformulation. Astheuser’sfeedbackisgraduallycollected
fromtheCTRsystems’onlineservingprocess,itnaturallyforms
a Bernoulli trial sequence. Let V𝑢={𝑣|(𝑢,𝑣,𝑦)∈D }be the in-
teracted item set of user 𝑢induced by D. Similarly, we can alsodenoteU𝑣={𝑢|(𝑢,𝑣,𝑦)∈D }as the interacted user set for item
𝑣. Admittedly, in click behavior modeling, the click rate 𝑟should
dependonthespecificuser-itempair.Unfortunately,historicaldata
is often very sparse (i.e., a user𝑢always has only been exposed
toafewitemsintheentireitemset V).Thismakesitdifficultto
estimatethebetadistributionforeachuser-itempair.Therefore,we
estimate the click probability distribution for each user 𝑢and each
item𝑣independently. Intuitively, this can be understood as model-
ingwhetherauserismorewillingtoclickonitemsandwhether
an item is more attractive for users to click on.
Given the collected dataset D, we first reorganize it chronically
basedon𝐾periodsoftime, i.e.,D={D1,D2,···,D𝐾},wherethe
D𝑘is the sub-dataset of the 𝑘-th period. The period here can be a
period of time (such as a day or a week), or in extreme cases, it can
be each timestamp. Without loss of generalization, the methodsfor modeling users and items are the same. Therefore, we only
introducethe clickprobabilitydistribution estimationof theitem
in detail here. Let 𝐼𝑣=/parenleftBig

(𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑢,𝑣)∈D𝑘, and𝐶𝑣
𝑘=/summationtext.1
(𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑢,𝑣)∈D𝑘𝑦𝑢,𝑣. Next, we detail
how to leverage the arranged sequence to update the personalized
beta distribution for item 𝑣.
Initializing the beta distribution. In real applications, to obtain
amoreaccurateestimation,especiallyfortheusers/itemswithrarehistoricalimpressionrecords,wecaninitializethebetadistribution
by learning from all the historical data.
Let Beta( 𝛼0,𝛽0) denote the initialized beta distribution as the
prior distribution for all items. The 𝛼0is the average click number
amongallitems,and 𝛽0istheaverageunclickedimpressionnumber.
Then the initialized distribution is given by:
𝛼0=1

𝑢∈U𝑣(1−𝑦𝑢,𝑣),(5)
where|V|the number of item and U𝑣={𝑢|(𝑢,𝑣,𝑦)∈D }is the

4.2 Constructing Extended Preference Pairs

readout from the estimated probability of user clicks 𝑃𝑢
clickand the
probability of the item being clicked 𝑃𝑣
clicked, and finally obtain a
scalar as the final posterior probability as:
𝑃agg=agg(𝑃𝑢
click,𝑃𝑣
clicked), (9)
where the aggregation function agg(·)could be any function such
as the maximum or the average function.
The final augmented preference score 𝑧is then obtained by
summing the pooled probability and the original click label:
𝑧=𝑃agg+𝑦. (10)
Wecanclearlyseethatevenifthepair (𝑢,𝑣),(𝑢,𝑣/prime)hasthesame
binary preferences, it is less likely that they also have the sameposterior probabilities at the same time. In this way, we are able to
extendthedefinitionofthepreferencepairinSection3.1asfollows:
Definition 2 (Extended preference judgement pair). An
extendedpreferencejudgementpairisdefineas: (𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢,𝑣/prime),where
𝑧𝑢,𝑣is greater than 𝑧𝑢,𝑣/prime.
In summary, our proposed BBP ranking framework is able to
construct pairs even with the same preferences ( i.e.,1v s .1o r0
vs. 0). Although our model does not explicitly output a ranking
score,thisapproachisconsistentwithourgoalofhavinguseritems
with higher ranking scores (i.e., clicked or with higher posterior
probability) associated with a higher predicted output probability.
4.3 Beyond Binary Preference Ranking
This ranking-based approach enables us to go one step further and
perform global context ranking. In other words, when building the
dataset,wedonotnecessarilyhavetoconsiderthesamecontext
(such as the clicked item and the unclicked item of the same user).
Instead,wecanrankthecorrelationsbetweenanyuseranditem
pairs.Thisfurtherimprovesthenumberoftrainingsamplesandthe
training flexibility of our model, as we no longer need to construct
a loss function based on the same user. By incorporating global
context ranking, our BBP framework can better generalize and
adapttovariousrankingscenarios,enhancingitsperformancein
real-world CTR prediction tasks.
During training, we construct a global context ranking loss.
Specifically, in each batch of a training set with a size of 𝐵,w e
computethedifferencebetweentheirscoresandobtainthelabelof
the partial order relationship:
Δ𝑧(𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)=𝑧(𝑢,𝑣)−𝑧(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime), (11)
where(𝑢,𝑣)and(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)are two user item pairs and 𝑧(𝑢,𝑣)and
𝑧(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)are their corresponding scores.
We then define an indicator function I(·)that returns one if the
difference is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise:
I(Δ𝑧(𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime))=/braceleftBigg
1,ifΔ𝑧(𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)>0
0,otherwise.(12)
We can also compute the difference of the corresponding model
output:
Δ𝑠(𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)=𝜎(𝑓(x𝑢,𝑣)−𝑓(x𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)) (13)
After that, we check whether the partial order relationship (differ-
ence) between the model’s output 𝑓(x𝑢,𝑣)is consistent with the
partial order relationship label. The calculation is given by:
Lrank=−1
𝑀𝑀/summationdisplay.1

𝜎/parenleftBig
Δ𝑠(𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)·I(Δ𝑧(𝑢,𝑣)⋗(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime))/parenrightBig/parenrightBig

(14)
where𝑀=/parenleftbig𝐵

𝜎(·)is the sigmoid function. We compare all possible/parenleftbig𝐵
2/parenrightbigdifferent
user item pairs’ partial order (𝑢,𝑣)/follows(𝑢/prime,𝑣/prime)in this batch.
Following the SOTA methods [ 3,44], we optimize the binary
cross entropy loss per batch as the calibration loss Lcal:
Lcal=−1
𝐵/summationdisplay.1
(𝑢,𝑣,𝑦)𝑦𝑢,𝑣log𝜎(𝑠)𝑢,𝑣+(1−𝑦𝑢,𝑣)log(1−𝜎(𝑠)𝑢,𝑣).(15)

As a multi-task framework, the final loss is the weighted sum of
the calibration loss and the ranking loss:
Ltotal=𝜆L𝐵𝐶𝐸+(1−𝜆)Lrank, (16)
where𝜆∈[0,1]istheweightingfactorhyper-parameter.Empiri-
cally, we find that 𝜆is a stable hyper-parameter that is free from

4.4 Computational Complexity Analysis
We provide in detail computational complexity analysis in both
theory and deployed systems running time.
Firstly,letushave 𝑁recordsinourdataset.AsshowninSec.4.1,
thepre-computinghasthreesteps.Thefirststepisaveragingthe
whole dataset, so the complexity is 𝑂(𝑁). The second step uses
the fixed-point iteration method to update the personalized beta
distribution.Notethatwesetaconstantmaximumiterationstep,
and the total length is also 𝑁for the impression ( 𝐼) and click ( 𝐶)
sequence,respectively.So, thecomplexityisalso 𝑂(𝑁).Thethird
step estimates the posterior probabilities for all users and items.
Note that the complexity for each user or item is 𝑂(1), and the
number of users and items is always less than the number of total
recordsN(becauserecordscomefromthecombinationofusersand
items). So, in summary, the computational complexity for our pre-
computingis 𝑂(𝑁),whichmeansourmethodislinearlyscalable
with the amount of data.
In practice, we record the time used in our large-scale industrial
datasetsofTencentgames.Inourdeployedinstance,ittakesaround
31 minutes to pre-compute 38 million interaction records, which is
fastenoughtopre-computethebetadistributionsformillionsof
records daily. Moreover, given that the training time cost is around
6 7 hours, the pre-computing takes only less than 8% of the total
time (i.e., pre-computing + training).
5 EXPERIMENTS ON PUBLIC DATASETS
5.1 Experimental Settings
The experiments conducted in this study on public datasets are
designed to address the following three research questions:
RQ1:Does the BBP framework outperform the existing state-of-
the-art (SOTA) models in CTR prediction tasks?
RQ2:Does BBP’s breaking ties in CTR improve the performance?
RQ3:DoestheglobalcontextsfurtherenhanceBBP’sperformance?
Experimental environments. We conduct the experiments on a
machineequippedwithaTeslaV100GPUwith16GBGPUmemory,
22CPUcores,and90GBsharedCPUmemorywithTensorFlow[ 1].
Datasets.WeusethreesubsetsoftheAmazondatasets[ 35]:Cloth-

treatedthesampleswithratingsgreaterthanfouraspositiveand

image features (image embeddings extracted by the pre-trainedVGG-16[ 45]featureextractor),textfeatures(reviewembeddings
extractedbythepre-trainedBERT[ 10]),userprofile(averagevector
ofuserhistorical reviewembeddings),anditem attribute(average
vector of item history review embeddings).
To ensure a robust evaluation of our model, we split the dataset
based on the user’s ID into a 7:1:2 ratio for the training, valida-
tion,andtestsets.Thisprocedureguaranteesthatallusersinthe
validation and test sets are not present in the training set, thus
providinganunbiasedassessmentofthemodel’sperformanceon
unseen users. Furthermore, to avoid the risk of label leakage, we
constructed Bernoulli trials only on the training set and performed
Bayesian smoothing. This step ensures models’ generalization and
effectiveness in real-world CTR prediction tasks. By adopting this
user-basedsplittingstrategyandincorporatingBayesiansmooth-
ing,wecanbetterunderstandthemodel’sgeneralizationcapability
and performance in CTR prediction tasks.
5.2 Hyper-parameter settings
We use Adam as the optimizer. We set the batch size to 256 and

theembeddingdimensionforeachfeatureto8,thenumberofheads
to 2, the dimension of the heads to 4, the attention dropout rate to
0.1, and the number of hidden units to [512,256,64].
Specifically, we simply set 𝜆to 0.5 in Eq. (16) to take the balance
between calibration and ranking.

5.4 Results in Public Datasets (RQ1)
To answer RQ1and validate the performance of different train-
ing paradigms for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, we conduct
experimentsonthreepublicdatasets:Clothing,Music,andElectron-
ics. As shown in Table 2, our proposed BBP method consistently
outperformsallpointwise,pairwise,andlistwisealternativesacross
all datasets regarding LogLoss and AUC metrics.
Thepairwisetrainingparadigms,includingBPR[ 40]andSAUC[ 47],
struggle with calibration and achieve limited ranking performance.
TheirLogLossvaluesaresignificantlyworsethantheBinaryCross
Entropy (BCE) baseline, as indicated by the red color. Since BPR
andSAUCignorethecalibrationlossduringtraining,thepredictedscore keeps drifting and can raisea NaN (Not a Number) LogLoss
for calculating log(0). Although they show some improvements in
AUC compared to the baseline, their performance is still inferior
tothelistwiseandourBBPmethods.Sincepairwisebaselinesin-
cluding BPR and SAUC are not designed for calibration, we modify
them by using calibrated loss. Specifically, we add the pairwise
losseswithaweightedBCEloss,similartoEq.(16).Wehavecon-
ducted additional experiments after fine-tuning the weight of BCE
loss as our BBP does. The results show that BBP also significantly
outperforms calibrated pairwise competitors for all metrics.
Ontheotherhand,listwisemethodshandlecalibrationandrank-
ing simultaneously due to their multi-task design. They achieve
betterperformancethanthepairwisemethods,withSC[ 51]and
JRC[44]oftenbeingthebest-performingalternativestoourmethod.
However, their performance still falls short compared to BBP, as
the significant 𝑝-values indicate.
With its beyond binary preference ranking, our BBP method
stands out by achieving the best performance across all datasets
andmetrics.TheLogLossvaluesarethelowest,andtheAUCvalues
are the highest among all methods, indicating that BBP provides
thebestcalibrationandranking.Thesignificant 𝑝-valuesfurther
confirm the superiority of BBP over all competitors. As shownin Eq. (9), BBP can leverage different functions to aggregate the

Inconclusion,theexperimentalresultsdemonstratetheeffective-

advantagesoverallSOTAcompetitors,especiallythepairwisetech-
niques, and sets a new benchmark for CTR prediction.

6 INDUSTRIAL DEPLOYMENT
6.1 In-Game Friend Recommendation
WehavedeployedourBBPtrainingparadigmmodelanditstoptwo
competitors, SC and JRC, on two Tencent games: a mobile battle
royale game denoted by X and a casual party game denoted by Y.
CTR Prediction for Friend Recommendation. The deployed
methods serve for friend recommendation tasks in both real-world
games. The friend recommendation is a resident module in both
gamesXandY.Whenaplayer 𝑢(inviter)accessestherecommenda-
tionmoduletofindsomeotherplayerstobecomein-gamefriends, 𝑢
seesanorderedlistofinteractednon-friendplayers.Thisgenerates

recommendationlogs.Therequestrequiresapproval;theclicked
invitee𝑣can decide to accept or reject it. If 𝑢and𝑣successfully
become in-game friends, the recommendation module generates a
successrecord. In summary, the CTR prediction model is used to
infertheprobabilitythataninviter 𝑢clicksonaninvitee 𝑣,andthen
the recommendation list is generated according to the descending
order of predicted CTR.

Offlinedatasetcollection. Wegathertheone-weeklogsoflog-in
players, and we consider the inviters 𝑢who clicked at least one
invitee𝑣as the positive examples in the beforehand recommenda-
tion module. We treat the clicked invitees as positive samples and
the unclicked ones as negative samples. If an inviter 𝑢clicks on
an invitee 𝑣at least once, the interaction is viewed as a positive
sample, and we will filter out repeated 𝑢−𝑣pairs. Each dataset
contains thelogs of thein-game recommendation modules of all
logged-inplayerswithinsevencontiguousdays,alongwiththeir
in-game features as follows:
•Players’ profile data, including all related in-game attribute data
of a player, such as the game level, gender, online time, etc.
•Pairwiseinteractionfeatures,includingtheinteractiondatabe-
tweenthe 𝑢and𝑣,suchasthenumberofcommonfriends,and
the number of common matches etc.
•Players’socialnetworkproperties( i.e.,theexistingin-gamesocial
networkproperties),includingthelocalnetworkstructure,the
number of friends, etc.
All raw features are standardized using min-max normalization
beforebeingfed intotheCTRpredictionmodels.The statisticsof
games X and Y can be found in Table 3.
6.2 Offline Evaluation
We first trainthe modelswith datasetsX andYoffline toevaluate
their performance. We split the dataset by inviter 𝑢’s id into a 7:1:2
ratio for training, validating, and testing datasets. We perform the
Bayesian smoothingonly onthe train setlike Section5.1 to avoid
label leakage. For the evaluation metrics, since we are interestedin whether the inviter
𝑢would click the invitee 𝑣in the friend
recommendation list, we report Hit rate@N and NDCG@N, where
N is 10, 20, and 50 to show the performance of models on different
positions. As summarized in Table 4, the offline evaluation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our BBP method compared to the
competing methods in all metrics. This observation justifies that
our method is more effective than the competitors for ranking the
player list in real-world friend recommendation tasks.
6.3 Online Evaluation
Toevaluatetheperformanceofthevariousmethodsinanonline
setting, we additionally conduct online A/B tests on both games[
19,30–32,53–56]. The friend recommendation module in each
game is updated with the deployed models, and their performance
is monitored over one week (from 2024/01/19 - 2024/01/25). We
evaluateBBP,SC,andJRCinthefriendrecommendationtaskusing
threemetrics: (i)ClickRate,whichistheproportionof clickuser
amongimpression records;(ii)Approval Rate, the proportion of
successapproval among clickinvitations; and (iii)overall Friend
Rate, the proportion of successapproval among impression records.
The overall Approval Rate is the product of the Click Rate and the
Approval Rate after invitations are sent, i.e., Friend Rate =Click
Rate×Approval Rate.
The online evaluation results in Table 5 demonstrate that our
proposedBBPmethodconsistentlyoutperformsthestate-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods SC and JRC in terms of Click Rate, Approval Rate
andFriendRateforbothgamesXandY.Specifically,considering
the definition of Friend Rate, the BPR we proposed can increaseTable 3: Statistics of real-world game datasets.

These results indicate that the BBP method is highly effective
in enhancing the friend recommendation module in both games,
leadingtohigheruserengagementandsatisfaction.Thesuperior
performance of BBP in real-world scenarios further validates its
effectiveness and applicability in CTR prediction and downstream
recommendation tasks.

A EMPIRICAL STUDY ABOUT USER
BEHAVIOR
A.1 The Beta Distribution Assumption
Click-through rate (CTR) is the probability of a user clicking on
an item. Considering the binary nature of the clicking behavior
(click or not), it can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with an under-
lying probability 𝑟. Tofurther validateour assumptionabout beta
distribution,weconducttheKolmogorov-Smirnovtestandother
data-basedanalysestoshowthattheassumptionisreasonablein
our deployed system.
Firstly, we conduct a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the active
users’ click rates and our estimated beta distribution. The H0 isthe click rate that obeys our estimated beta distribution. The re-sult shows that the K-S statistic is 0.01641195 and the p-value is0.13383894. Given that the p-value > 0.05, we accept the H0 that
the users’ click rates obey a beta distribution.
Secondly, we provide a Quantile-Quantile plot to show the re-
lationship between our estimated beta distribution (Theoretical
Quantiles) with real-world players’ behavior (Sample Quantiles).
Figure 4: The Q-Q plot of user click rate in our deployed
system.
As shown in Fig. 4, the Quantile-Quantile plot shows that the
real-world players’ behavior fits nicely with our estimated beta
distribution.A.2 The Confidence Level Distribution with
Number of Training Samples
BBP may fail to estimate personalized distributions with high con-
fidence levels for users with limited samples in the training set.
Intuitively,theBayesiansmoothingdrivestheposteriorprobabili-
tiesfromtheinitializedbetadistributiontoamorepersonalizedone.If the user does not have enough samples, their posterior probabili-
ties will be similar to the posterior probability from our initialized
beta distribution.Inthe extremecase,if theuserdoes nothaveany
historical data, his posterior probability will be derived from the
initializedbetadistribution.Aswetreatimpressionsandclicksas
visiblevariablesofauserthatobeyaBinomialdistributionwithan
underlyingprobability 𝑟.OurBayesiansmoothingaimstoestimate
personalized posterior probabilities for the Binomial distribution.
We provide further tests on the visible user behavior, i.e., the
clickobeyingthepersonalizeddistributionestimatedbyBBP.We
testactiveplayersinourdeployedsystem.Theresultshowsthat
70.43%ofthetotalplayersobeytheirpersonalizeddistributionof
BBP, determined by the significance at p-value > 0.05. We agree
with you that the number of samples of users is important because
we find that less than 30% of players fail in the test of their limited
records in real-world applications. We also provide a Boxplot to
showtheconfidenceofthepersonalizeddistributionamongplayers,
illustrating that most players obey their personalized distribution.

the BBP’s output estimation in our deployed system.
Due to the complexity of real-world deployment scenarios, it is
unavoidablethatsomeuserswithinsufficientdata(suchas cold-start
players who have just joined the game). However, BBP has already
outperformedallcompetitorsinouronlineandofflineexperiments.
B IMPACT OF HYPER-PARAMETER
Empirically, we find that 𝜆is a stable hyper-parameter that is free
from time-consuming fine-tuning. Intuitively, as we design both
calibration loss in Eq. (15) and ranking loss in Eq. (14) in a sigmoid-
then-logstyle,thescaleofthetwolossesaresimilar.Toshowour
intuition, we perform a grid search of 𝜆in [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9] on
the Music dataset and report the average LogLoss and AUC metric
w.r.t.the different 𝜆.
As shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, when we increase the 𝜆, the
totallossprefersmorecalibrationduringtraining,whichleadsto

range, BBP continues to outperform the best baseline (represented

This analysis demonstrates that the hyper-parameter 𝜆is sta-
ble and does not require extensive fine-tuning, which simplifies
thetraining processandmakesBBP morepracticalfor real-world
applications.Furthermore,therobustperformanceofBBPacross
