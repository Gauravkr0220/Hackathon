Abstract
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems are routinely solved by SAT
solvers in real-life applications, yet solving time can vary drasti-
cally between solvers for the same instance. This has motivated
research into machine learning models that can predict, for a given
SAT instance, which solver to select among several options. Ex-
isting SAT solver selection methods all rely on some hand-picked
instance features, which are costly to compute and ignore the struc-
tural information in SAT graphs. In this paper we present GraSS,
a novel approach for automatic SAT solver selection based on tri-
partite graph representations of instances and a heterogeneous
graph neural network (GNN) model. While GNNs have been previ-
ously adopted in other SAT-related tasks, they do not incorporate
any domain-specific knowledge and ignore the runtime variation
introduced by different clause orders. We enrich the graph represen-
tation with domain-specific decisions, such as novel node feature
design, positional encodings for clauses in the graph, a GNN archi-
tecture tailored to our tripartite graphs and a runtime-sensitive loss
function. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this
combination of raw representations and domain-specific choices
leads to improvements in runtime for a pool of seven state-of-the-
art solvers on both an industrial circuit design benchmark, and

1 Introduction
The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is one of the most funda-
mental computer science problems, with numerous applications
in planning and scheduling [ 9,24], formal software verification
[16, 22] and electronic circuit design [17, 21]. A SAT instance con-
sists of a formula with Boolean variables, such as (𝑥1∨𝑥2)∧(𝑥1∨
𝑥2∨𝑥3)∧𝑥1, and the problem involves finding an assignment of
values for each variable 𝑥𝑖which makes the whole formula true, or
proving that no such assignment exists. Although the problem is
NP-complete [ 8], many SAT solvers have been designed over the
years and modern CDCL-based solvers are routinely able to solve
industrial problems within minutes [33].

Figure 1: The workflow of our method. SAT instances are represented as literal-clause graphs with hand-designed attributes.
Rounds of heterogeneous graph convolutions are applied, which modify the attributes. The attributes of the clause and variable
nodes are then averaged, before being fed to a linear layer followed by a softmax over the various solvers. The convolutions and
the linear layer are trained to minimize by gradient descent a runtime-sensitive classification loss computed from runtimes
collected on training SAT instances.
Structural differences between different SAT problems mean that
the choice of solver can have a dramatic impact on the solving time.
This has motivated the use of machine-learning based methods for
selecting the optimal solver to use for a given instance, with the
hope that data-driven models can see patterns where humans have
been unsuccessful. The most influential of those has probably been
SATzilla [ 46], which has won several times the annual SAT Compe-
tition [ 7]. This model relies on machine learning algorithms that
require a fixed-dimensional vector of features as input, irrespective
of the actual instance size (number of clauses and variables). This
necessarily implies that some aspects of a SAT problem are not
taken into account when performing solver selection.
In recent years, machine learning has been revolutionized by
deep learning models trained on raw descriptions of data points
such as image pixels or text strings [ 18]. In particular, surprising
success has been found in a variety of combinatorial optimization
tasks by representing optimization problems as graphs, and feeding
them as inputs to graph neural networks [ 5]. Such models are able
to take the complete representation of a problems as input, in a
size-independent way, and see patterns where humans have been
unable to distinguish any.
In this work, we propose GraSS (Graph Neural Network SAT
Solver Selector), the first graph neural network (GNN) based method
for automatic SAT solver selection. We represent instances as literal-
clause graphs [ 19], thus encoding the entirety of the information
pertaining to an instance. To improve performance further, we
also endow the graph with hand-designed features representing
domain-knowledge about which aspects of the graph should be
particularly useful for solver selection, as well as positional encod-
ings for the clauses to allow for order-specific effects. Our GNN
model consists of learned graph convolutions operating over each
type of edge, with a node-specific pooling operation prior to a lin-
ear classifier. We train our model in a supervised manner with aruntime-sensitive classification loss. The training data consists of a
collection of instances for which the runtimes of multiple solvers
have been collected.
On both a large-scale industrial circuit design benchmark, and
on instances from the Anniversary Track of the 2022 SAT Com-
petition [ 2], we report improvements in performance compared
to seven competitive solvers, as well as state-of-the-art machine
learning approaches. We also perform a complete ablation study to
rigorously test the importance of each component of our proposed
pipeline.
In summary, our contributions are as follows.
•We propose the first approach for SAT solver selection that makes
complete use of the SAT instance data, by representing each
instance as an attributed graph and using a GNN model.
•We propose a model architecture that is tailored to the tripartite
graph representations.
•We design novel node-level features to incorporate domain-specific
knowledge.
•We report for the first time the value of including positional en-
codings for clauses in the graphical representation of an instance
for a SAT-related machine learning task.
•We introduce a novel runtime-sensitive classification loss, which
could be of value for general algorithm selection tasks.
•We report state-of-the-art empirical performance on two hard
SAT benchmarks and conduct extensive ablation studies to con-
firm the value of our architectural choices.
Collectively, these elements strongly suggest our approach should
be regarded as a new standard in the field of SAT solver selection.

2 Related Work
2.1 SAT Solver Selection
There exists a rich literature describing machine learning models
for the selection of the optimal SAT solver for a given instance. This
approach is sometimes referred to as portfolio-based SAT solving.
A detailed summary is provided by Holden et al. [20, Section 6].
SATzilla [ 46] and its successors [ 45,47] are a family of classifica-
tion models that have won multiple prizes in the SAT Competition
(2007 and 2009) and the SAT Challenge (2012). SATzilla uses hand-
selected features to characterize each SAT instance for best solver
selection. The latest version of SATzilla [ 45] consists of a feature
cost classifier to predict if the entire set of features can be computed
within a time threshold and an algorithm selector for instances with
feature cost less or equal to this threshold. Whereas the first ver-
sion [ 46] applies ridge regression, the latest version [ 45] uses a
cost-sensitive decision tree for the algorithm selection model.
In addition to the SATzilla family, hand-picked features have also
been used with 𝑘-nearest neighbor or clustering methods to select
the best algorithm [ 23,32,34]. CSHC [ 32] uses a cost-sensitive
hierarchical clustering algorithm to iteratively partition the feature
space into clusters in a supervised top-down fashion. In combina-
tion with the static algorithm schedule of 3S [ 23], it achieved better
performance than SATzilla in the 2011 SAT Competition. ArgoS-
mArT [ 34] uses a combination of a 𝑘-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model and a multi-armed bandit algorithm. The KNN performs
solver selection based on the nearest instance to the queried in-
stance in a metric space.
Finally, Loreggia et al . [31] proposed a deep learning approach
based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They take tex-
tual representations of SAT instances in a standard format, and
convert them into grayscale images by replacing each character
with its corresponding ASCII code. These images are then rescaled
to 128x128 pixels, and fed to a CNN, which is trained to predict
the fastest solver in the pool. Although employing deep learning,
this approach is not lossless, as the rescaling required by the CNN
architecture leads to information loss, unlike our approach.
2.2 Algorithm Selection
More generally, SAT solver selection is a special case of algorithm
selection, which aims to select, for a given input, the most efficient
algorithm from a set of candidate algorithms. This is particularly
important for computationally hard problems, where there is typi-
cally no single algorithm that outperforms all others for all inputs.
Besides SAT solving, algorithm selection techniques have achieved
remarkable success in various applications such as Answer Set Pro-
gramming (ASP) [ 15] and the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
[1]. A thorough literature review is provided in Kerschke et al . [25] .
Algorithm selection methods can be roughly divided between
offline and online methods. Offline methods, such as this work,
rely on training ahead of time on a labeled dataset, whereas online
algorithms attempt to improve selection performance as more and
more cases are run. Although providing worse initial performance,
online methods avoid the computational cost of the initial training
phase and the problem of distribution shift between training and
test data, and methods based on based on reinforcement learning or
multi-armed bandits have been proposed for this purpose [ 10,15].The many design choices in algorithm selection systems pose
new challenges for efficient system development. For example, Auto-
Folio [ 30] automatically configures the entire framework, including
budget allocation for pre-solving schedules, pre-processing proce-
dures (such as transformations and filtering) and algorithm com-
ponent selection. It achieved competitive performance in multiple
scenarios from the ASLib [4] benchmark.
2.3 Graph Neural Networks in SAT Solving
Several works have explored applications of GNNs to various as-
pects of SAT solving in the past, even if not specifically to the prob-
lem of solver selection. In all these works, some kind of graphical
representation of SAT instances is used. Multiple suggestions have
appeared in the literature: these include lossless representations
like literal-clause graphs (LCGs) and variable-clause graphs (VCGs),
and lossy representations like literal-incidence graphs (LIGs) and
variable-incidence graphs (VIGs) [ 19]. These different representa-
tions strike a balance between graph size and information content,
and have found success in various SAT-related tasks.
Some prior works have explored the use of GNNs to learn local
search heuristics in SAT solvers [ 28,48]. Yolcu and Póczos [48]
represent SAT formulas as variable-clause graphs (VCGs) and a
GNN model is trained to select variables whose sign to flip at every
step through a Markov decision process (MDP). The learned heuris-
tic is shown to reduce the number of steps required to solve the
problem. Graph-Q-SAT [ 28] uses a deep Q-network (DQN) with
GNN architecture to learn branching heuristics in conflict driven
clause learning (CDCL) solvers. Each SAT formula is converted into
a VCG, and GNN layers are used to predict the 𝑄-value of each
variable. The variable with the highest 𝑄-value for the specific as-
signment is selected for branching. The learned heuristic is shown
to significantly reduce the number of iterations required for SAT
solving.
Instead of relying on existing SAT solvers, NeuroSAT [ 38] uses a
GNN-based model to predict satisfiability of an instance in an end-
to-end manner. Each SAT formula is represented by a literal-clause
graph (LCG), as in our work. After several steps of message-passing,
the updated embedding of each literal is projected to a scalar “vote”
to indicate the confidence that the formula is satisfiable. The votes
are averaged together and passed through a sigmoid function to
produce the model’s probability that the instance is satisfiable. On
randomly generated instances from a SR(40) distribution, NeuroSAT
solved 70% of SAT problems with an accuracy of 85%. A subsequent
work, NeuroCore [ 37], uses a lighter NeuroSAT model to predict
the “core” of instance, which is the smallest unsatisfiable subset of
clauses. This prediction is then used to guide variable selection in
SAT solver algorithms.
Finally, graph neural networks have also been widely used for
SAT instance generation. For example, G2SAT [ 49] and HardSAT-
GEN [ 29] represent instances as LCGs, and generate new variants
from an iterative splitting and merging process driven by a GNN.
Furthermore, W2SAT [ 44] extends this approach by representing
instances as weighted graphs encoding literal co-occurence among
clauses, while using a similar generation mechanism.

scribed in Appendix A.
3 Approach
We now describe our proposed approach. The workflow of our
method is shown in Figure 1.
3.1 Problem
Our SAT solver selection problem can be formally described as
follows. We have a fixed pool of SAT solvers 𝑆1,...,𝑆𝐾and a SAT
instance𝑎, and we must select a solver so as to solve the instance
in the smallest runtime possible.
To do so, at train-time, we are given a collection of SAT in-
stances and for each instance 𝑎𝑖, we are given sampled solving
times𝑡1
𝑖,...,𝑡𝐾
𝑖from each solver. This dataset can be used for train-
ing a machine learning model offline in a supervised manner. At
test-time, a separate collection of SAT instances are given to the
model, which selects a solver for each. The selected solver for each
instance is run, and the average runtime over all testing instances
is used to benchmark performance of the selector model.
3.2 Representation and features
The inputs to the model are individual SAT instances. We assume
that they are formulated in conjunctive-normal form (CNF), that is
as a formula 𝑐1∧···∧𝑐𝑚where each 𝑐𝑖is aclause, which in turn
is in the form 𝑐𝑖=𝑙1∨𝑙2∨..., where each literal𝑙𝑖stands for a
variable𝑥𝑗in the problem, or its negation ¯𝑥𝑗. Any SAT problem
can be converted into an equivalent CNF problem in linear time
[40].
Given CNF SAT instances, we input them to the machine learn-
ing model as literal-clause graphs (LCGs) [ 19] endowed with extra
information in the form of node features. A representation is pro-
vided in Figure 2. The literal-clause graph of a SAT instance is an
undirected graph with three types of node: one node 𝑐𝑗per clause
in the graph, and two nodes 𝑥𝑖and ¯𝑥𝑖per variable in the graph,
representing itself and its negation respectively. An edge is drawn
between a clause node 𝑐𝑗and a variable node 𝑥𝑖/¯𝑥𝑖if the variable
(respectively, its negation) appears as literal in the clause. Finally,
an edge is drawn between every positive and negative variable
node.In addition, to every clause node and variable node, we attach
feature vectors. Most features are hand-designed and are inspired
by those used by SATzilla [ 45,47]. They represent expert knowledge
that is known to be critical for SAT solving process, such as the
presence of Horn clauses, which are clauses containing at most
one positive literal. These are especially important for the solving
process as the collection of Horn clauses can be proved within
linear time [ 11]. Besides these hand-designed features, clause node
features are also enriched with a positional encoding, described in
the next subsection. A complete list of the features used is provided
in Appendix A.
3.2.1 Clause positional embeddings. In principle, satisfiability of a
SAT formula is not affected by permuting the variables or clauses,
and literal-clause graphs are permutation-invariant as well. In prac-
tice, however, we found solver runtimes can be sensitive to the
order in which clauses are provided as input. We conducted a study
with the popular Kissat 3.0 [ 3] solver on the industrial LEC dataset
described further in Section 4. As can be seen in Figure 3, shuf-
fling clauses sometimes led to very large variations in runtime. In
contrast, shuffling variables showed limited impact.
This is in line with previously reported remarks on other SAT
solvers [ 12,39]. A possible explanation could be the algorithmic
design of modern solvers, for which the storage architecture of
variables relies on a doubly linked list and the initial storage order
follows the parsing order of the clauses. This results in variations
in cache miss rates depending on the provided clause ordering. In
contrast, variable ordering usually only impacts the variable labels
used by the solvers.
To address the sensitivity to clause ordering, we include po-
sitional encodings among the clause features. These encode the
position of a clause within the CNF formula. We follow the classical
encodings from Vaswani et al . [41] and endow the 𝑘thclause with
a𝑑𝑃𝐸-dimensional embedding
𝑃𝐸(𝑘,2𝑖)=sin𝑘
𝑛2𝑖/𝑑𝑃𝐸
,
𝑃𝐸(𝑘,2𝑖+1)=cos𝑘
𝑛2𝑖/𝑑𝑃𝐸
,
where𝑖=0,...,⌊𝑑𝑃𝐸/2⌋−1. In practice we chose 𝑛=10000 so
that the right-most digit of the positional encoding has a maximum
wavelength of 62800, which slightly exceeds the maximum number
of clauses in the data (50000); and we chose 𝑑𝑃𝐸=10, which is close
to the dimension of the other clause node features, 𝑑𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 =7, so
the model is neither overly influenced by the positional encoding
or the other features. This vector is concatenated with the rest of
the clause node features.
3.3 Model
We use a graph neural network (GNN) model to predict which
solver to use for a given instance. These models operate on graphs
by repeatedly modifying node embeddings through graph convo-
lution operations, and have emerged as a standard paradigm for
dealing with graph-structured data, both in SAT solving [ 19] and
more widely for combinatorial optimization in general [ 5]. How-
ever, we deviate from standard graph convolution frameworks by
interpreting our literal-clause graph as a graph with six types of

data, and the order of variables (left) and clauses (right) are shuffled twenty times. The instances are then solved by Kissat 3.0
with a 5,000s cutoff, and the collected runtimes are plotted in ascending order of mean runtime.
edges: (i) from clause to positive literal nodes; (ii) from clause to
negative literal nodes; (iii) from positive literal to clause nodes; (iv)
from negative literal to clause nodes; (v) from positive and negative
literal nodes; and (vi) from negative to positive literal nodes. These
graphs can then be interpreted as “heterogeneous graphs”, and we
can apply heterogenous GNN methodologies [50].
A diagram of our neural network architecture is provided as
Figure 1. Let 𝑉=𝑉clause∪𝑉poslit∪𝑉neglit denote the set of nodes
in our literal-clause graph. To every node 𝑖∈𝑉we associate a
vector, its node embedding ℎ𝑖, which is initialized by 17-, 3-, and
3-dimensional feature vectors described in Table 7,
ℎclause,𝑖←features clause,𝑖∀clause node 𝑖
ℎposlit,𝑖←features poslit,𝑖∀positive literal node 𝑖
ℎneglit,𝑖←features neglit,𝑖∀negative literal node 𝑖
These are then transformed by two rounds of graph convolutions.
We use the same convolutions as the ones of Kipf and Welling [27],
with a relu nonlinearity. That is, let us denote 𝑁clause(𝑖),𝑁clause(𝑖)
and𝑁clause(𝑖)the sets of clause, positive literal and negative literal
nodes that are connected by an edge to a node 𝑖. Then for a node
𝑖∈𝑉tof a type t∈T={clause,poslit,neglit}, we compute a new
200-dimensional node embedding by
ℎ𝑖←relu

t,sℎ𝑗
√︁
deg(𝑖)deg(𝑗)
for𝑙=1,2, where in these transformations 𝑏(𝑙)
tand𝑊(𝑙)
t,sare
learned parameter vectors and matrices.
After these two rounds of message passing, we average the node
embeddings for each node type,
ℎposlit←1
|𝑉poslit|∑︁
𝑖∈𝑉poslitℎ𝑖, ℎ neglit←1
|𝑉neglit|∑︁
𝑖∈𝑉neglitℎ𝑖,ℎclause←1
|𝑉clause|∑︁
𝑖∈𝑉clauseℎ𝑖.
The positive and negative literal embeddings are then themselves
averaged,ℎlit=(ℎposlit+ℎneglit)/2, and then the concatenation of
this embedding and ℎclause is passed to a linear layer with a softmax
activation to produce the estimated probabilities for each of the 𝐾
SAT solvers under consideration,
𝑝𝑘=exp(𝑤⊤
𝑘[ℎlit,ℎclause]+𝑏𝑘)
Í𝐾
𝑙=1exp(𝑤⊤
𝑙[ℎlit,ℎclause]+𝑏𝑙),
where the vectors 𝑤1,...,𝑤𝐾and the scalars 𝑏1,...,𝑏𝐾are also
learned parameters.
3.4 Training
We train in a supervised fashion on a dataset of training SAT in-
stances, for which runtimes have been collected ahead of time on
each solver of interest. Since our model produces a distribution
over the𝐾possible solvers, we could treat the problem as simple
classification with a cross-entropy loss. However, this would not
be well-aligned with our objective of minimizing solving runtime,
since it would equally penalize incorrect predictions, irrespective
of the amount of additional runtime induced by the selection of a
suboptimal solver. Instead, we propose the regret-like loss

is the best time achieved by any solver on the instance. This has the
advantage of more directly optimizing final runtime, taking into
account that not all mistakes are equally impactful on solving time.
We minimize this loss using the Adam [ 26] algorithm with early
stopping.

3.5 Inference
At test-time, to predict which SAT solver to use, we convert the SAT
instance into our graph representation, compute its node features,
and feed the graph to our trained GNN model, which outputs a
probability distribution over the solvers of interest. The solver with
highest probability is chosen for solving the instance, with the
runtime being reported.
4 Experiments
We now compare the performance of our proposed approach against
competitors in the literature. We implement our model using the
pytorch [35] and dgl[43] libraries. We train the model on a single
Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU with a learning rate of 1𝑒−3for up to 100
epochs, and use the same GPU at test-time.
4.1 Base solvers
We train and evaluate on a portfolio of seven top-performing solvers
from recent SAT Competitions [ 3,14]: (a) Kissat-3.0 , (b)bulky ,
(c)HyWalk , (d) MOSS , (e)mabgb , (f)ESAand (g) UCB. Among them,
Kissat-3.0 andbulky are based on Kissat , which is the winner
of the 2020 SAT Competition and is known for its efficient data
structure design [ 14]. The other five solvers are based on UCBand
differ in their bandit-based scoring mechanism for branching. It
should be noted that our method works for any choice of candidate
solvers.4.2 Datasets
We train and evaluate on two datasets.
Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC). This is a proprietary dataset
generated from logic equivalence checking steps in electronic cir-
cuit design. Circuits undergo a large number of optimization steps
during logic synthesis, and at each one of the steps, it is necessary
to verify that the circuits before and after optimization are func-
tionally equivalent. This is done by verifying that the two circuits
produce the same outputs for all possible inputs, which is equivalent
to solving a SAT problem [ 17,21]. We collected logic equivalence
checks from the optimization of 30 industrial circuits, yielding a
total of 78,727 SAT instances. A summary of dataset statistics is
provided as Table 1a.
SAT Competition (SC). This is a subset of the Anniversary Track
Benchmark of the 2022 SAT Competition [ 2], which itself was
created by collecting all instances from the Main, Crafted and Ap-
plication tracks of the previous SAT competitions up to that year.
We ran each instance of the Anniversary benchmark through each
of the seven solvers in the portfolio, and excluded those that could
not be solved within 1,500 seconds by any solver, as well as those
with more than 20,000 variables, yielding 2,088 SAT instances. A
summary of dataset statistics is provided as Table 1b.
4.3 Baselines
We compare our approach with the following baselines.
Best Base Solver. The individual solver among the portfolio of
seven that had the best performance on the training data, measured
in average runtime over all instances. In practice, this was the bulky
solver for both datasets.
SATzilla07 [ 46].We adapt this landmark SAT solving machine
learning model, based on a linear ridge regression model trained
to predict runtimes based on global handcrafted features that sum-
marize SAT instance characteristics. Since our work focuses on
SAT solver selection, we omit the presolving process in the original
SATzilla pipeline. We also remove features in the original model
that require probing. This leaves 33 global features (#1-33 in the
original article). The model is trained from the Ridge class in the
scikit-learn [36] library with default settings. We convert the
approach into a SAT solver selection model by selecting the solver
with shortest predicted runtime.
SATzilla12 [ 45].We also adapt the updated SATzilla model from
2012, which was based on random forest classification. Again, we
remove the presolving process, and only use the features that do
not require probing (features #1-55 in the original article). We train
a random forest model between each pair of solvers, weighting each
training instance by the absolute difference in runtime between
the two solvers, for 7(7−1)/2=21models in total. Each model is
trained from the RandomForestClassifier class in scikit-learn
with 99 trees and⌈𝑙𝑜𝑔2(55)⌉+1=7sampled features in each tree.
At test-time, each model is used to vote which solver it prefers in
its pair for solving an instance, and the final solver choice is made
from the solver that has received the most votes.
6306GraSS: Combining Graph Neural Networks with Expert Knowledge for SAT Solver Selection KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
ArgoSmArT [ 34].This is an approach based on a 𝑘-nearest neigh-
bors model trained for classification. We used the same 29 features
as in the original paper, which form a subset of the 33 features used
in our adaptation of SATzilla07. We use the KNeighborsClassifier
class in scikit-learn with𝑘=9neighbors.
CNN [ 31].We reimplement the approach of Loreggia et al . [31] ,
where the CNF formula is interpreted as text, converted to its
ASCII values and then to a grayscale image, before being resized to
128x128 pixels and fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
We use the same architecture as in the paper, which we implement
in the pytorch [35] library, and train it over a cross-entropy loss
with the Adam [ 26] algorithm, a learning rate of 1e-3 and early
stopping.
4.4 Metrics
We report the following metrics for performance evaluation. Results
are averaged over five train-test folds over the data, and the average
and standard deviation over those five folds are reported.
Average Runtime (Avg Runtime). For each instance, the method
selects a solver, and this solver is used to solve the instance, report-
ing a runtime. These runtimes are then averaged over all instances.
In other words, this is the average runtime that would be observed
if this method were used for all instances, as a “portfolio" solver.
Lower is better.
Percentage of Solved Instances (Solved). The percentage of in-
stances that can be solved by the selected solver within a cutoff
time of 500s. Higher is better.
Classification Accuracy (ACC). The accuracy of selecting the
optimal solver for a given instance. This measures how efficient a
method is in selecting the optimal solver. Higher is better.
4.5 Main Results
We report in Table 2 the main results of our experiments on the
Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) and SAT Competition (SAT)
datasets, respectively. As can be seen, our proposed GraSS method
outperform competing approaches in average runtime, as well as
in percentage of problems solved within our 500s cutoff time. In-
terestingly, this is true despite the method not being as accurate in
selecting the optimal solver for every instance, as measured by the
accuracy metric. This suggests that an important component of its
success lies in its improved robustness to error: when the method
makes mistakes, they impact runtime less than competing methods.
To understand this phenomenon further, we looked at the run-
time difference between the predicted solver and the optimal solver,
whenever a mistake is made. As can be seen in Figure 4, the average
cost of wrong prediction is substantially lower for our method than
for competitors, especially for the SC dataset.
We further analyze the performance difference between our ap-
proach and the next best method in average runtime, SATzilla12. Ta-
ble 3 regroups the instances by rough measure of difficulty, namely
by grouping them by which quartile (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% or
75-100%) their best runtime achieved on any solver falls into, andTable 2: Main results on the LEC and SC benchmarks. We
report the average and standard deviation over 5 train-test
folds. For every best result, we bold the number and conduct a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test whether the distribution of
the differences in results between this method and the next
best method for every instance and fold is equally distributed
around zero. An asterisk (∗) next to the number denotes a p-
value lower than 0.05.†The CNN on the LEC dataset predicted
bulky for every instance, giving identical results to "Best base
solver". Oracle results serve as an upper limit where the best
solver is selected for each SAT instance.

while GraSS performs better on hard instances.
Finally, as described in Subsection 4.4, our timing results only
report the time taken by the solvers in optimizing the instances. In
particular, this means we exclude from the numbers the time taken
to compute the features necessary to take the decision, which is
dependent on the storage format used to save the instances. For our
experiments, we chose to save them on a hard drive in the standard
.cnf text file format [ 6], and we report for completeness the time

taken to compute the features for each method in Table 4. Other
storage formats would lead to different timings.
4.6 Ablation Study
We extend our analysis by considering the impact of various method-
ological choices on performance over the LEC benchmark.
We first evaluate the impact of the graph neural network archi-
tecture, by comparing our approach with a variant that uses the
same convolution weights for every edge, effectively treating it
as a homogeneous graph (Homogeneous ). We also compare with a
NeuroSAT-style architecture (NeuroSAT variant ) inspired by Selsam
et al. [38] , which was originally designed for satisfiability prediction
(sat/unsat). Their model also uses a literal-clause graph to encode
instances, although with learned initial node embeddings, and usesTable 4: Comparison of the time taken to compute the fea-
tures required for each method from .cnf files. We report the
mean and standard deviation in seconds over the instances
for each dataset.

a very deep LSTM-GNN hybrid architecture with 26 layers and
custom graph convolution operations. We implement the same, but
replace the final layer which computes a scalar “vote” for every
literal, and takes the average vote before a sigmoid activation, by
an averaging of the literal embeddings, followed by a linear layer
and a softmax activation. We also use 4 layers instead of 26 for
tractability on our dataset, whose instances are substantially larger
than those in the original paper. As can be seen in Table 5, our
approach improves over these alternatives in every metric.

a one-hot vector indicating whether the node represents a clause,
positive or negative literal ( Node-type ), as used in Li et al . [29] , Yolcu
and Póczos [48] and You et al . [49] ; and Laplacian Positional Encod-
ings (Laplacian PE ), as introduced in Dwivedi et al . [13] . We also
compare against a variant of our approach consisting of the same
hand-designed features, but without the clause positional embed-
dings (Custom ). As can be seen in Table 6, our choices outperform
these alternative approaches in every metric.

5 Deployment
We deployed and tested our method in an internal Logic Equiv-
alance Checking (LEC) tool for a major semiconductor company.
The original approach formerly used in the industrial setting was
to use the best-overall solver to solve all the SAT problem, which is
suboptimal due to the heterogeneity of SAT problems. Using the
method proposed in the paper, we trained a GNN model with run-
time data for each candidate solver and deployed the model online
to predict the best solver to use for each SAT problem. Experiments
were conducted with 35,857 SAT problems, originating from 12
industrial circuit cases, and our method was trained to predict the
instance-specific best solver from three candidate solvers. Using our
proposed method, we obtained reduce the total runtime by 25.4%
compared to the best overall solver. This is a significant reduction,
which had an important industrial impact, because it substantially
reduced the circuit design cycle time. For these 12 circuits alone,
this represented a saving of over 21 hours.
6 Limitations
Although our experiments strongly establish the superiority of our
approach in the presented scenario, several limitations can be noted.
Deep learning methods are well-known to be data hungry, and
perform best in regimes where training sets are large. It is plausible
that in scenarios where a limited number of timed instances are
available, performance would not be competitive against simpler
models. In addition, in many scenarios it might be desirable to learn
online, updating models as examples stream in: our method cannot
be readily adapted to this situation, as training requires runtime
labels on every solver for each instance, and adapting graph neural
networks to online learning is challenging [42].
7 Conclusion
This work proposed a novel supervised approach to SAT solver se-
lection, based on representing instances as literal-clause graphs and
training a graph neural network to select, from this representation,
a SAT solver among a fixed portfolio so as to minimize solving run-
time. The graph representations are endowed with node features
that encode domain knowledge, and in the case of clause nodes, also
position within the SAT formula. The resulting scheme is shown to
outperform competing approaches on two benchmarks, one from
an industrial circuit design application and one from the annual
SAT solver competitions.
