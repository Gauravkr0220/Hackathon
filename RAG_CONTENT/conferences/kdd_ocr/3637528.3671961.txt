ABSTRACT
Spatiotemporal time series forecasting plays a key role in a wide
range of real-world applications. While significant progress has
been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotem-
poral heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore,
we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter
Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures
spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and tem-
poral embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process.
Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is
proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-
parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity.
Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity- Informed Spa-
tiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time se-
ries forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used bench-
marks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance while exhibiting superior interpretability. Our code is avail-
able at https://github.com/XDZhelheim/HimNet .

1 INTRODUCTION
The rise of sensor networks has brought the widespread collec-
tion of spatiotemporal time series in urban environments. As these
datasets grow quickly, accurate spatiotemporal time series fore-
casting is increasingly important for many real-world applications
such as transportation [ 29,31], weather [ 1], and economics [ 32].
While considerable efforts [ 16,17,21,50] have been made, existing

methods still face a major challenge: fully capturing and leverag-
ingspatiotemporal heterogeneity . Spatial heterogeneity refers
to the phenomenon that distinct patterns are observed across dif-
ferent location types during the same time period, while temporal
heterogeneity is reflected by the unique patterns observed at the
same location across different time periods. Figure 1 provides a real-
world example. As shown in Figure 1(a), we analyze two areas in
different spatial contexts: Area 𝐴1in downtown LA and Area 𝐴2in
a residential region. Figure 1(b) reveals substantial differences in ve-
hicle speed distributions between them: 𝐴1shows a lower average
speed due to daily downtown congestion, while 𝐴2exhibits higher
speeds with less commuting pressure. This demonstrates spatial
heterogeneity. Figure 1(c) illustrates their time series in different
temporal contexts. The patterns are stable during the holiday (Sun.)
but fluctuate violently during the workday (Mon.). Furthermore,
morning peak hours and nighttime off-peak hours also exhibit op-
posing trends, showing temporal heterogeneity. These phenomena
occur consistently throughout spatiotemporal data. Thus, effec-
tively modeling spatiotemporal heterogeneity is critical to accurate
forecasting. As time series from diverse spatial locations and time
periods display distinct characteristics, proper capturing of het-
erogeneity relies on identifying and distinguishing such varied
spatiotemporal contexts.
To account for different contexts, graph-based approaches [ 35,
52,62] attempt to capture heterogeneity by utilizing handcrafted
features such as graph topology and similarity metrics between
time series. However, depending heavily on pre-defined repre-
sentations limits their adaptability and generalizability, as these
features cannot encompass the full complexity of diverse contexts.
To enhance adaptability, other works introduce meta-learning tech-
niques [ 46,47] that apply multiple parameter sets across different
spatial locations. However, they also rely on auxiliary characteris-
ticsincluding Points-of-Interests (POIs) and sensor placements. Ad-
ditionally, the high computational and memory costs limit their
applicability to large-scale datasets. Recent representation learning
methods [ 38,51] effectively identify heterogeneity through input
embeddings. However, their oversimplified downstream processing
structures fail to fully leverage the representational power. While
self-supervised learning methods [ 18,24] also succeed in capturing
spatiotemporal heterogeneity by designing additional tasks, fully
end-to-end joint optimization for spatiotemporal forecasting con-
tinues to present difficulties for these approaches. In short, the key
drawbacks are: (1) reliance on auxiliary features; (2) high compu-
tational and memory costs; (3) failure to fully leverage captured
heterogeneity; and (4) difficulties with end-to-end optimization.
To address the above limitations in prior works, we propose
a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning
scheme and a Heterogeneity- Informed Meta-Network (HimNet)
for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. In detail, we first implic-
itly characterize heterogeneity by learning spatial and temporal
embeddings from a clustering view. The representations gradually
differentiate and form distinct clusters during training, capturing
underlying spatiotemporal contexts. Next, a novel spatiotemporal
meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to enhance model
adaptability and generalizability, which is flexible for various do-
mains. Specifically, we learn a unique parameter set for each spa-
tiotemporal context via querying a small meta-parameter pool.Based on these, we further propose Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-
Parameter Learning that uses the characterized heterogeneity to
inform meta-parameter learning. Thus, our approach can not only
capture but explicitly leverage spatiotemporal heterogeneity to
improve forecasting. Finally, we design an end-to-end network
called HimNet, implementing these techniques for spatiotemporal
forecasting. In summary, our contributions are three-fold:
•Methodologically, we present a novel HimNet model for
spatiotemporal time series forecasting. It captures inherent
spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learnable embeddings,
which then inform spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning
to enhance model adaptability and generalizability.
•Theoretically, to the best of our knowledge, our proposed
Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning is the
first method that not only captures but also fully leverages
spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This enables our model to
distinguish and adapt to different spatiotemporal contexts.
•Empirically, HimNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-
art methods on five benchmarks based on extensive experi-
ments, demonstrating superior performance with competi-
tive efficiency. Visualization experiments further illustrate
its strong interpretability through meta-parameters.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Spatiotemporal Forecasting
Spatiotemporal forecasting has seen extensive research as it plays a
key role in many real-world applications [ 14,15,27,37,39,65,69–
71]. Early approaches relied on traditional time series analysis
methods such as ARIMA [ 45] and VAR [ 53], as well as machine
learning techniques including 𝑘-NN [ 10] and SVM [ 55], but they
often fail to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent
to the data. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in
deep learning methods. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like
LSTMs [ 42,43] and GRUs [ 7] achieved performance gains by effec-
tively modeling the temporal dynamics. Convolutional networks
such as WaveNet [ 44] also found success via their long receptive
fields. However, these models do not fully represent spatial de-
pendencies critical to networked urban systems. To address this
limitation, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been exten-
sively explored for spatiotemporal forecasting. Pioneering works
such as STGCN [ 64] and DCRNN [ 36] achieved better performance
by integrating GCNs with temporal models [ 2,4,59,60]. Building
on this foundation, many innovative methods have been proposed
in recent years [ 12,13,28,30,33,34,49,61]. Moreover, Trans-
former [ 56] has also revolutionized the field, motivating time series
transformers [ 6,57] that expertly capture spatiotemporal correla-
tions [ 23,26,38,66] or handle long sequences [ 40,58,67,68]. While
showing impressive performance, existing work still lacks further
exploration of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Our study aims to fill
this gap through a novel HimNet that captures and leverages the
heterogeneity for improved spatiotemporal forecasting.
2.2 Meta-Parameter Learning
One of the earliest works [ 48] proposed predicting network param-
eters for temporal modeling. More recently, Hypernetworks [ 20]
applied this idea to recurrent networks by generating adaptive

weights, acting as a form of weight-sharing across layers. Lear-
net [ 3] was constructed as a second deep network to predict the
parameters of another deep model. Dynamic Filter Networks [ 25]
dynamically generate convolutional filters conditioned on input, in-
creasing flexibility due to their adaptive nature. For meta multi-task
learning, MetaMTL [ 5] introduced a shared Meta-LSTM to gen-
erate basic LSTM parameters based on the current input context.
In spatiotemporal applications, ST-GFSL [ 41] proposed learning
non-shared parameters for cross-city transfer using learned spa-
tiotemporal meta-knowledge from the input city. While effective
in other domains, these methods were not designed specifically for
spatiotemporal forecasting. To address this, recent works have intro-
duced meta-parameter learning techniques for spatiotemporal data.
ST-MetaNet [ 46] first applied meta-learning across spatial locations,
using auxiliary POI and road network information as spatial meta-
knowledge to learn multiple parameter sets. AGCRN [ 2] proposed
node adaptive parameter learning to generate node-specific param-
eters from a learned embedding matrix, which can be interpreted
as learning node specific patterns from a set of candidate patterns
discovered from all spatiotemporal time series. ST-WA [ 8] proposes
a spatiotemporal aware approach to jointly learn location-specific
and time-varying model parameters from encoded stochastic vari-
ables. In contrast to these approaches, as shown in Table 1, Him-
Net learns meta-parameters using only the spatiotemporal time
series itself, without depending on auxiliary features. Critically, we
propose a concurrent learning scheme that operates on the tempo-
ral, spatial, and spatiotemporal joint dimensions simultaneously.
Therefore, HimNet achieves maximum adaptability to any kind of
spatiotemporal context. This makes our approach highly flexible
and capable of extracting the full informational value from learned
spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION
Given a spatiotemporal time series 𝑋𝑡−(𝑇−1):𝑡over the past 𝑇time
steps, our goal is to forecast the values over the future 𝑇′time
steps. That is, we aim to map [𝑋𝑡−(𝑇−1),...,𝑋𝑡]→[𝑋𝑡+1,...,𝑋𝑡+𝑇′],
where each𝑋𝑖∈R𝑁represents the observations at the 𝑖-th time step
for𝑁time series, typically from sensors deployed at 𝑁locations.
4 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we present details of our proposed Heterogeneity-
Informed Meta-parameter Learning scheme along with the HimNet
model, where the key components are depicted in Figure 2. To better
illustrate our proposed method, we consider a minibatch dimension
𝐵in the following discussions. For ease of understanding, 𝐵can be
assumed to be 1 without loss of generality.4.1 Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity Modeling
A key aspect of modeling spatiotemporal heterogeneity is identify-
ing and distinguishing input contexts across both temporal and spa-
tial dimensions [ 11]. Rather than relying on auxiliary data [ 46,52],
we employ learnable embeddings [ 38,51], which assign a unique
representation to each spatiotemporal context.
For the temporal dimension, we construct a time-of-day embed-
ding dictionary 𝐷𝑡𝑜𝑑∈R𝑁𝑑×𝑑𝑡𝑜𝑑and a day-of-week dictionary
𝐷𝑑𝑜𝑤∈R𝑁𝑤×𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑤, where𝑑𝑡𝑜𝑑and𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑤 are the embedding di-
mensions,𝑁𝑑denotes the number of timesteps per day, and 𝑁𝑤
represents the number of days in a week. Given a minibatch of
input samples 𝑋𝑏∈R𝐵×𝑇×𝑁with historical length 𝑇, the last
step’s timestamp of each sample in the minibatch is used as the
time index to extract the corresponding time-of-day embedding
𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑑∈R𝐵×𝑑𝑡𝑜𝑑and day-of-week embedding 𝐸𝑑𝑜𝑤∈R𝐵×𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑤
from the dictionaries. The two embeddings are concatenated to
obtain the overall temporal embedding 𝐸𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑑𝑡:
𝐸𝑡=𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑑||𝐸𝑑𝑜𝑤, (1)
where𝑑𝑡=𝑑𝑡𝑜𝑑+𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑤 represents the temporal embedding dimen-
sion and||denotes concatenation operation. Time-of-day identifies
periodic patterns with fine-grained time intervals, capturing phe-
nomena like peak and off-peak hours. Day-of-week identifies mean-
ingful longer-term patterns, such as the distinction in time series
between weekdays and weekends. Leveraging these dictionaries,
the temporal embedding aims to learn representations that can
implicitly recognize and account for such temporal heterogeneity
over multiple timescales.
For the spatial dimension, we utilize a spatial embedding matrix
𝐸𝑠∈R𝑁×𝑑𝑠, where𝑁denotes the total number of time series or
spatial locations in the dataset (e.g. number of sensors) and 𝑑𝑠is
the dimension of the embedding vector assigned to each location.
Unlike the temporal dimension where the embeddings are extracted
from learned dictionaries, here each of the 𝑁spatial locations is di-
rectly associated with a unique learnable spatial embedding vector
initialized randomly in the embedding matrix. The goal of introduc-
ing𝐸𝑠is to account for the inherent functional differences between
locations that can influence time series patterns, such as factors
related to infrastructure and urban design. It aims to learn latent
representations that can help distinguish such diverse contexts,
without the need for auxiliary geographical data. This facilitates
modeling the spatial heterogeneity present in each location.
Furthermore, learning these embedding vectors essentially per-
forms a dynamic clustering process. During model training, the
representations within the embedding matrices gradually differen-
tiate based on the input time series. Embedding vectors belonging
to spatiotemporal contexts that exhibit similar trends in their time
series will move closer in the latent space, and vice versa. As a re-
sult, this dynamic adjustment of the embeddings can be viewed as a
clustering process, where representations organically form clusters.
Each distinct cluster captures a typical context in the spatiotempo-
ral time series. Analogous to the NLP models where the learned
embeddings of "man" and "woman" can naturally be very close,
this clustering process could be successfully achieved without in-
volving any additional constraints like the way did in [ 24,28]. This
clustering perspective is what empowers the model to distinguish

different contexts and thereby accurately model the heterogeneity
across space and time. Through the learned embeddings, spatiotem-
poral heterogeneity is modeled in an intrinsic, data-driven manner,
without requiring manual feature engineering or domain expertise
to describe it in advance.
4.2 Spatiotemporal Meta-Parameter Learning
To fully leverage the heterogeneity encoded in the spatiotemporal
embeddings, we propose Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter
Learning. It provides a simple yet effective way to improve model
adaptability and generalizability.
We begin by introducing the general meta-parameter learning
paradigm. For the model’s original parameter space Θwith size𝑆,
our approach first extends it along a specific dimension to create
an enlarged parameter space Θ′. Specifically, we can build three en-
larged spaces for the temporal and spatial dimensions: temporal pa-
rameter space Θ𝑡∈RT×𝑆, spatial parameter space Θ𝑠∈R𝑁×𝑆, and
spatiotemporal joint space Θ𝑠𝑡∈RT×𝑁×𝑆. Here,Trepresents the
total number of timesteps and 𝑁is the number of spatial locations
in the dataset. This extension aims to assign a unique parameter
set to each spatiotemporal context, rather than sharing Θ. Directly
optimizing these enlarged parameter spaces is prohibitively expen-
sive, as they become very huge, especially when Tand𝑁are large,
which will lead to exploding computational and memory costs. To
address this challenge, we maintain a small meta-parameter pool
for each parameter space, which contains 𝑘parameter candidates.
The pool size 𝑘is defined to be much smaller than Tand𝑁, but
sufficiently large to encapsulate the variety of different contexts.
For an incoming query representing a specific spatiotemporal con-
text, we dynamically generate its meta-parameter as a weighted
combination of the pool candidates.
For a meta-parameter pool 𝑃∈R𝑘×𝑆, given a queryQ∈R𝑘, the
general formulation of our meta-parameter learning paradigm is:
𝜗=Q·𝑃, (2)where𝜗∈R𝑆is the generated meta-parameter. By maintaining
meta-parameter pools, our approach alleviates this computational
burden by optimizing within the compact pools rather than the
full enlarged parameter spaces. Thus, the complexity is reduced
from𝑂(T𝑁)to𝑂(𝑘), where𝑘≪T𝑁. This makes the learning
computationally feasible for large spatiotemporal datasets.
Specifically, we leverage the embeddings proposed earlier that
encode spatiotemporal heterogeneity as queries to adaptively gen-
erate the meta-parameters for each spatiotemporal context. This
results in a Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning
approach. Based on Equation 2, three types of meta-parameters are
generated for the respective enlarged parameter spaces.
Temporal Meta-Parameters. We maintain a small temporal meta-
parameter pool 𝑃𝑡∈R𝑑𝑡×𝑆containing𝑑𝑡candidates. Using the
temporal embedding 𝐸𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑑𝑡as queries, the temporal meta-
parameters 𝜗𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑆are generated by:
𝜗𝑡=𝐸𝑡·𝑃𝑡. (3)
Spatial Meta-Parameters. We maintain a small spatial meta-
parameter pool 𝑃𝑠∈R𝑑𝑠×𝑆with𝑑𝑠candidates. Using the spatial
embedding 𝐸𝑠∈R𝑁×𝑑𝑠as queries, the spatial meta-parameters
𝜗𝑠∈R𝑁×𝑆for each location are generated by:
𝜗𝑠=𝐸𝑠·𝑃𝑠. (4)
ST-Mixed Meta-Parameters. To directly create a joint spatiotem-
poral embedding is prohibitive, as its size would also be too large
to optimize effectively. Instead, we utilize the rich information in-
herently contained within the input data itself [ 8], where the time
series patterns naturally reflect spatiotemporal heterogeneity. For
a minibatch of input samples 𝑋𝑏∈R𝐵×𝑇×𝑁, we encode it into a
spatiotemporal embedding 𝐸𝑠𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑁×𝑑𝑠𝑡as:
𝐸𝑠𝑡=𝐹𝑒𝑛𝑐(𝑋𝑏), (5)
 
634Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning for Spatiotemporal Time Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
where𝑑𝑠𝑡is the embedding dimension, and 𝐹𝑒𝑛𝑐(·)represents an
encoding function such as linear projection, TCN [ 64], or GRU [ 36]
designed to encode the input into a hidden representation.
Accordingly, we maintain a spatiotemporal meta-parameter pool
𝑃𝑠𝑡∈R𝑑𝑠𝑡×𝑆having𝑑𝑠𝑡candidates. Leveraging the encoded spa-
tiotemporal embedding 𝐸𝑠𝑡as queries, the spatiotemporal-mixed
(ST-mixed) meta-parameters 𝜗𝑠𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑁×𝑆are generated by:
𝜗𝑠𝑡=𝐸𝑠𝑡·𝑃𝑠𝑡. (6)
While we generate the meta-parameters based on the proposed
embeddings, the underlying meta-parameter learning technique
itself is not limited specifically to these embeddings. We present
a purely data-driven approach using only the intrinsic spatiotem-
poral heterogeneity in the time series itself. However, other aux-
iliary spatiotemporal features could also be utilized if available in
the dataset, such as POIs, weather patterns, or urban structural
characteristics. These supplemental contextual attributes could be
encoded into the query representation to provide further instruc-
tion for meta-parameter learning. Therefore, the method is flexible
and can leverage diverse contextual features to learn improved
meta-parameters tailored to various application domains.
4.3 Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal
Meta-Network
Leveraging our proposed techniques, we implement an end-to-
end model called Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-
Network (HimNet) for accurate spatiotemporal forecasting.
Taking inspiration from GCNs, researchers have developed graph
convolutional recurrent networks [ 36,49,63] which leverage both
graph convolutions and recurrent transformations. By integrating
graph convolutions within recurrent cells, these models can effec-
tively capture temporal dynamics while also accounting for the
spatial relations in the graph. Therefore, our proposed HimNet ar-
chitecture uses variants of the widely adopted Graph Convolutional
Recurrent Unit (GCRU) [ 2,28] as the fundamental building block.
GCRU is formulated by:
𝑟𝑡=𝜎(Θ𝑟★G[𝑋𝑡,𝐻𝑡−1]+𝑏𝑟)
𝑢𝑡=𝜎(Θ𝑢★G[𝑋𝑡,𝐻𝑡−1]+𝑏𝑢)
𝑐𝑡=tanh(Θ𝑐★G[𝑋𝑡,(𝑟𝑡⊙𝐻𝑡−1)]+𝑏𝑐)
𝐻𝑡=𝑢𝑡⊙𝐻𝑡−1+(1−𝑢𝑡)⊙𝑐𝑡,(7)
where𝑋𝑡∈R𝑁and𝐻𝑡∈R𝑁×ℎdenote the input and output at
timestep𝑡.ℎis the hidden size. 𝑟𝑡and𝑢𝑡are the reset and update
gates.Θ𝑟,Θ𝑢,Θ𝑐are parameters for the corresponding filters in the
graph convolution operation ★G, which is defined as:
𝑍=𝑈★G=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=0˜𝐴𝑈𝑊𝑘, (8)
where𝑈∈R𝑁×𝐶is the input, 𝑍∈R𝑁×ℎis the output, and 𝐶
denotes the input channels. ˜𝐴represents the topology of graph G,
and𝑊∈R𝐾×𝐶×ℎis the kernel parameter Θ.
By applying temporal meta-parameter learning to GCRU, we
propose a temporal meta-encoder. Referring to Equation 3, the
generated temporal meta-parameters in this encoder take the form
𝑊𝑡∈R𝐵×𝐾×𝐶×ℎ. Similarly, we build a spatial meta-encodervia spatial meta-parameter learning, with generated spatial meta-
parameters𝑊𝑠∈R𝑁×𝐾×𝐶×ℎby applying Equation 4. For the graph
Gused in the encoders, rather than relying on a static pre-defined
adjacency matrix as in prior works [ 19,36,64], we follow the adap-
tive graph learning design [ 59,60]. Specifically, we leverage our
learned spatial embeddings 𝐸𝑠to dynamically generate the adja-
cency matrix ˜𝐴∈R𝑁×𝑁as:
˜𝐴=Softmax(ReLU(𝐸𝑠·𝐸⊤
𝑠)). (9)
In short, given an input 𝑋𝑏∈R𝐵×𝑇×𝑁, the two encoders operate
in parallel to encode it into two hidden representations based on
their respective meta-parameters. These representations are then
summed to yield the final combined hidden encoding 𝐻∈R𝐵×𝑁×ℎ.
To decode the latent representation 𝐻into predictions, we pro-
pose a spatiotemporal meta-decoder that leverages ST-mixed
meta-parameters. Specifically, we first generate the corresponding
spatiotemporal embedding 𝐸𝑠𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑁×𝑑𝑠𝑡from𝐻:
𝐸𝑠𝑡=𝐻·𝑊𝐸+𝑏𝐸, (10)
where𝑊𝐸∈Rℎ×𝑑𝑠𝑡and𝑏𝐸∈R𝑑𝑠𝑡are the linear projection pa-
rameters. According to Equation 6, we then produce the ST-mixed
meta-parameters for GCRU as 𝑊𝑠𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑁×𝐾×𝐶×ℎusing query
𝐸𝑠𝑡. Moreover, inspired by [28], we apply a time-varying adaptive
graphG𝑠𝑡inferred from 𝐸𝑠𝑡:
˜𝐴𝑠𝑡=Softmax(ReLU(𝐸𝑠𝑡·𝐸⊤
𝑠𝑡)), (11)
where ˜𝐴𝑠𝑡∈R𝐵×𝑁×𝑁. The decoder takes the initial hidden state
from𝐻and iteratively generates predictions ˆ𝑋for each future
timestep by applying the GCRU cell parameterized by 𝑊𝑠𝑡.
Given ground truth 𝑋𝑡+1:𝑡+𝑇′, we mainly adopt the Mean Abso-
lute Error (MAE) loss as our training objective to optimize multi-
step predictions jointly. The loss function for HimNet’s multi-step
spatiotemporal time series forecasting can be formulated as:
L=𝑀𝐴𝐸(ˆ𝑋𝑡+1:𝑡+𝑇′,𝑋𝑡+1:𝑡+𝑇′)=1
𝑇′𝑁𝑇′∑︁
𝑖=1𝑁∑︁
𝑗=1|ˆ𝑋𝑖,𝑗−𝑋𝑖,𝑗|.(12)

granularity of 5 minutes between consecutive timesteps. Therefore,
𝑁𝑑=288 and𝑁𝑤=7 in these benchmarks. Additional details regard-
ing the five benchmarks can be found in Table 2. As part of data
preprocessing, we perform Z-score normalization on the raw inputs
to rescale the data to have zero mean and unit variance. To ensure a
fair comparison to previous methods, we adopt the commonly used
dataset divisions from prior works. For the METRLA and PEMSBAY
datasets, we use 70% of the data for training, 10% for validation, and
the remaining 20% for testing [ 36,60]. In the case of the PEMS04,
PEMS07, and PEMS08 datasets, we divide them into 60%, 20%, and
20%, respectively [ 19,38]. In this study, we ensured the ethical
useof these five publicly available datasets.
Settings. We performed hyper-parameter search on each dataset.
The encoder and decoder each contain one layer 𝐿=1 with a hid-
den dimension ℎ=64 for the first four datasets, and ℎ=96 for the
PEMS08 dataset. For the embeddings, the dimensions of the tempo-
ral embedding 𝑑𝑡, the spatial embedding 𝑑𝑠, and the spatiotemporal
embedding 𝑑𝑠𝑡are all set to 16 for the first four datasets. And for
PEMS08, the dimensions are 12, 14, and 10, respectively. The input
and prediction horizons are both set to 1 hour ( 𝑇=𝑇′=12 timesteps).
We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001
and decay over training, and the batch size 𝐵is 16. The maximum
training epochs is 200, with an early stop patience set to 20. For
the loss function, we employ MAE loss for METRLA and PEMS-
BAY. For PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08, we further employ Huberloss [ 22], a variant of MAE that is more robust. Model performance
is evaluated using MAE, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). All following experiments are
conducted on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs.
Baselines. We compare our HimNet to several widely adopted
baselines. HI [ 9] is a standard statistical technique. GRU [ 7] is a
widely adopted univariate time series forecasting method. As for
spatiotemporal forecasting, we select several typical models includ-
ing STGCN [ 64], DCRNN [ 36], Graph WaveNet [ 60], AGCRN [ 2],
GTS [ 49], STNorm [ 11], STID [ 51], ST-WA [ 8], PDFormer [ 26] and
MegaCRN [ 28]. Among them, DCRNN, GTS, and MegaCRN also
apply GCRU-based architectures. AGCRN and ST-WA are meta-
parameter learning methods closely related to our approach.
5.2 Performance Evaluation
The comparison results for the performance of spatiotemporal
forecasting are given in Table 3. For the METRLA and PEMSBAY
datasets, we report performance on 3, 6, and 12 timesteps (15, 30,
and 60 minutes). Consistent with previous works, we report the av-
erage performance over all 12 predicted timesteps for the PEMS04,
PEMS07, and PEMS08 datasets. From the results, we obtain the
following observations: (1) Our proposed model, HimNet, signif-
icantly outperforms all baselines across all metrics and datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. By learning meta-
parameters based on spatiotemporal heterogeneity, our approach is
 
636Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning for Spatiotemporal Time Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
better able to adapt to diverse spatiotemporal contexts for accurate
forecasting. (2) Compared with other GCRU-based models DCRNN,
GTS, and MegaCRN, HimNet achieves better performance, high-
lighting the superiority of our meta-parameter learning scheme.
(3) While AGCRN learns parameters only for each spatial node,
our method further considers the temporal dimension and utilizes
spatiotemporal heterogeneity. ST-WA learns specific parameters for
each location and timestep based only on the knowledge learned
from the current input. However, our method fully captures and
leverages the global spatiotemporal heterogeneity, providing im-
portant guidance for more precise local parameter learning. As a
result, our HimNet demonstrates better forecasting performance
than others.
5.3 Ablation Study
In this section, we conduct ablation studies to validate key com-
ponents of our proposed approach. We designed the following
variants: (1) w/o 𝐸𝑡: replaces the temporal embedding with a static
matrix of all ones, thus removing temporal heterogeneity modeling.
(2) w/o𝐸𝑠: replaces the spatial embedding with a static matrix of
all ones, thus removing spatial heterogeneity modeling. (3) w/o 𝐸𝑠𝑡:
replaces the spatiotemporal embedding with a static matrix of all
ones. (4) w/o TMP: removes temporal meta-parameters by down-
grading to randomly initialized parameters. (5) w/o SMP: removes
spatial meta-parameters in the same way. (6) w/o STMP: removes
ST-mixed meta-parameters in the same way. As shown in Table 4,
using identical queries decreases forecasting performance, demon-
strating the effectiveness of our heterogeneity-informed approach.
Moreover, removing meta-parameters leads to more substantial
performance degradation, highlighting the value of applying the
spatiotemporal meta-parameters modulated by our method. All
these validate that HimNet is complete and indivisible to achieve
superior spatiotemporal forecasting performance.

5.4 Hyper-Parameter Study
We conduct experiments on our model’s sensitivity to key hyper-
parameters, including the dimension of the temporal embedding 𝑑𝑡,
the spatial embedding 𝑑𝑠, and the spatiotemporal embedding 𝑑𝑠𝑡.
Figure 3 plots the average RMSE of predictions on the METRLA
dataset when varying each embedding dimension from 4 to 24. In-
terestingly, we find that our model is fairly robust to changes in
these hyper-parameters. Across the ranges tested, the RMSE differ-
ence between the best and worst-performing configurations is only
approximately 0.1. An embedding size of 16 generally provides goodresults with a tractable parameter size. Still, some trends emerge
where decreasing a dimension too much begins to exhibit signs of
under-fitting, while larger dimensions will substantially increase
parameter size but without notable improvement in performance.
Figure 3: RMSE w.r.t. embedding dimensions on METRLA.
5.5 Efficiency Study
We evaluate efficiency by comparing HimNet with 10 spatiotem-
poral baseline models. Table 5 reports the number of parameters,
per-batch runtime, per-epoch runtime, and GPU memory usage on
METRLA (batch size 𝐵=16).
As shown in the table, models using TCNs, such as STGCN,
GWNet and STNorm, perform relatively well because of the high
computational efficiency of convolution. In comparison, the next
four models with GCRU architecture show a notable efficiency gap
due to the iterative nature of RNNs that intrinsically presents a
disadvantage. Additionally, Transformer-based models like ST-WA
and PDFormer are even worse due to their quadratic computational
complexity. Among these, STID performs best as its backbone is
simply linear layers. We also observe that HimNet’s memory usage
is relatively high, because our design of the meta-parameter pools
will enlarge its parameter size. In summary, our HimNet achieves
decent efficiency compared with other GCRU-based models, and
outperforms the Transformer-based baselines.
We further analyze a variant HimNet- Θ′that removes meta-
parameter pools and directly optimizes the three enlarged param-
eter spaces. HimNet- Θ′contains over 10.9 billion parameters, un-
available on any GPUs we can get. This is consistent with our
Table 5: Efficiency comparison on METRLA dataset.

leads to intractable memory costs, which validates the necessity

enabling flexible parameterization.
5.6 Case Study
In this section, we analyze the learned meta-parameters through
visualizations to gain better interpretability and demonstrate how
they reflect meaningful circumstances in the real world.
Temporal Meta-Parameters. Figure 4 provides visualizations on
temporal and spatial meta-parameters based on t-SNE [ 54] dimen-
sionality reduction. We extract the temporal meta-parameters for
each hour across the days of a week. With one day sampled at an
hourly granularity, this results in a total of 168 data points embed-
ded in the 2D latent space. As shown in Figure 4(a), distinct tight
clusters form for each individual day, demonstrating our method’s
ability to differentiate days of the week. Notably, weekdays and
weekends are widely separated, underscoring our effectiveness in
capturing the temporal heterogeneity between these day types.
Figure 6: The evolving ST-mixed meta-parameters of clusters
0 and 8. As the time series diverge, they evolve accordingly.
Figure 4(b) shows the cosine similarity between the temporal meta-
parameters of each hourly interval within a day. Higher similarity is
observed between adjacent hours, decreasing with increased tempo-
ral distance as expected. Interestingly, the time periods when people
travel frequently exhibit high similarity. For example, the periods
between 6-9am and 4-7pm show increased similarity, reflecting
real-world commuting behaviors. These examples demonstrate that
our proposed method successfully identifies and distinguishes the
diverse temporal contexts associated with different time periods.
Spatial Meta-Parameters. For the spatial meta-parameters, we
analyze the METRLA dataset as a case study. It contains 207 sensor
locations whose spatial meta-parameters are embedded in 2D latent
space as shown in Figure 4(c). The 207 points naturally form into
15 clusters marked with different colors. To interpret these clus-
ters, we draw them onto a real map of Los Angeles in Figure 4(d).
Remarkably, each cluster precisely aligns with road segments, un-
derscoring our model’s strong power to capture real-world urban
structural characteristics, even without the help of graph topology.
Moreover, opposite lanes of the same road contain points from
different clusters. Figure 4(e) shows clusters 3 and 13 as an example.
For visual clarity, we manually select one lane per road to draw
Figure 4(d). This exact matching between learned clusters and real
road topology demonstrates our method’s ability to explicitly dis-
tinguish spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, we analyze the time
 
638Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning for Spatiotemporal Time Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
series of clusters 3, 10, and 13 specifically. Cluster 10 corresponds to
a major downtown road prone to severe congestion. Clusters 3 and
13 are located on the opposite lanes of a minor road. As expected,
their traffic speed time series in Figure 4(f) show that clusters 3
and 13 are closely matched while significantly differing from 10,
consistent with our observations on the map and the latent space in
Figure 4(c). This validates that the spatial meta-parameters encode
meaningful contexts reflecting spatial heterogeneity.
ST-Mixed Meta-Parameters. Figure 5 provides a case study of
the evolving ST-mixed meta-parameters. Clusters 3 and 6 from
the crossroad area in Figure 5(a) are analyzed. Their traffic speed
time series are shown in Figure 5(b) with three periods highlighted:
midnight off-peak, morning peak, and noon off-peak. Ten nearby
sensors (5 per cluster) on the crossroad are visualized in Figure 5(c).
For their ST-mixed parameters, we draw cosine similarity heatmaps
across the three time periods in Figure 5(d). As expected, within-
cluster similarity is generally higher than cross-cluster similarity.
In detail, during midnight off-peak hours, both clusters exhibit sim-
ilar traffic speed patterns, reflected by high cross-cluster similarity.
However, during the morning peak, cluster 3 shows a sharp drop
in speed while cluster 6 maintains a higher level. Their time series
diverge, resulting in lower cross-cluster similarity. At noon, the
speed patterns in both clusters become closer, leading to an increase
in cross-cluster similarity again. Moreover, in Figure 6, we conduct
another case study on clusters 0 and 8. Figure 6(a) shows five sen-
sors each selected from the two clusters. As shown in Figure 6(b),
their time series diverge substantially over time. Correspondingly,
as illustrated in Figure 6(c), the cross-cluster similarity between
the ST-mixed meta-parameters associated with each sensor de-
creases accordingly over the three selected time periods. These
case studies intuitively explain how our ST-mixed meta-parameters
evolve spatially and temporally. Thus, the proposed approach has
strong adaptability to various spatiotemporal contexts, with meta-
parameters accurately capturing changes between different time
periods for each location. Furthermore, this also confirms the power
of our method to jointly model spatiotemporal heterogeneity.
6 CONCLUSION
In this study, we proposed a novel Heterogeneity-Informed
Meta-Parameter Learning scheme along with the state-of-the-art
Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet)
for spatiotemporal forecasting. In detail, we captured spatiotem-
poral heterogeneity by learning spatial and temporal embeddings.
A novel meta-parameter learning paradigm was proposed to learn
spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools.
Critically, our proposed approach can fully leverage the captured
spatiotemporal heterogeneity to inform meta-parameter learning.
Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrated Him-
Net’s superior performance. Further visualization analyses on meta-
parameters revealed its strong interpretability.
