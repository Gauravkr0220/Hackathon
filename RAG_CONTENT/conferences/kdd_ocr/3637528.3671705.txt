ABSTRACT
Causal discovery with observational and interventional data plays
an important role in numerous fields. Due to the costly and poten-
tially risky nature of intervention experiments, selecting informa-
tive interventions is critical in real-world situations. Several recent
works introduce Bayesian active learning to select interventions
that maximize the expected information gain about the underlying
causal relationship at each optimization step. However, there are
still some limitations within these methods: (1) Local optimality.
With multiple intervention experiments, selecting optimal interven-
tion myopically at each step may drop into the local optimal point.
(2)Expensive time cost. Optimizing the most informative interven-
tion at each step is time-consuming and not suitable for adaptive
experiments with strict inference speed requirements. In this study,
we propose a novel method called Reinforcement Learning-based
Causal Bayesian Experimental Design (RL-CBED) to reduce the risk
of local optimality and accelerate intervention selection inference.
Specifically, we formulate the active causal discovery problem as a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We design
an information gain-based sparse reward function and then improve
it to a dense reward function, providing fine-grained feedback to
help the RL policy learn more quickly in complex environments.
Moreover, we theoretically prove that the Q-function estimator can
be learned using only trajectories sampled from the prior, which
can significantly reduce the time cost of training process, enabling
the real-world application of our method. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real world-inspired semi-synthetic datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

1 INTRODUCTION
Identifying the causal relationship among variables of interest in
a system is a fundamental problem in various scientific research
domains, including biology [ 34,40], drug discovery [ 31], econom-
ics [35], and social science [ 29,38]. Causal discovery aims to learn
the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure of a set of variables and
its associated assignment mechanisms of each variables. Typically,
relying solely on observational data is insufficient for identifying
the unique DAG and one can only discover its Markov Equivalence
Class (MEC) [ 51]. Performing additional intervention experiments
can help alleviate the confusion in the MEC, but is usually expensive
and even risky [ 3]. With the development of active learning, several
methods are proposed to selecting intervention target and value
reasonably in order to discover more causal relationship under the
condition of controlling the cost of intervention experiments. As
shown in Figure 1, Active Causal Discovery (ACD) is a framework
where we first observe a batch of samples from the system of inter-
est, and use appropriate causal discovery algorithm to calculate the
posterior distribution over the Structural Causal Model (SCM) with
observational data. We then design interventional experiments, i.e.,
interventional target and value pairs, in order to maximally reduce
our uncertainty about the SCM. After performing the intervention,
we collect interventional data and use it to update the causal dis-
covery outcome. If experimental resources permit, this process can
be repeated and our estimated SCM gradually approaches the true

SCM. The aim of active causal discovery is to optimize interven-
tion experiments to discover more information about underlying
causality when the total cost (e.g., the number of experiments) is
limited.
Several recent studies [ 3,46] have incorporated Bayesian Opti-
mal Experimental Design methods into active causal discovery in
order to select interventions that maximize the expected informa-
tion gain (EIG) about the underlying causal relationship at each
step. However, there are limitations to these optimization-based
methods. Firstly, the existing approaches myopically select the in-
tervention that maximizes EIG at each step, without considering
it as a sequential process. After obtaining the intervention data
at each step, the causal discovery algorithm utilizes this data to
update the posterior model, that is, updating the predicted SCM. Se-
lecting interventions to maximize one-step information gain based
on the updated SCM often leads to getting stuck in some wrong
SCM, known as the local optimality, and is unable to maximize
the global EIG. Secondly, existing methods rely on optimization
algorithms at each step, such as Bayesian optimization, gradient de-
scent, etc., which are time-consuming for inferring and not suitable
for scenarios requiring adaptive experiments. In real-world causal
discovery situations, it is often essential to quickly decide the next
intervention based on current experimental results. The existing
methods optimize and find the optimal intervention for the current
step, which results in expensive time cost.
In this study, we propose a novel policy-based method for Bayesian
active causal discovery, achieving a new and effective reinforce-
ment learning solution to capture the sequential information among
each intervention and reduce the time cost of intervention selec-
tion. Specifically, we formulate the active causal discovery problem
as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) with
an information gain-based reward function and design a novel
neural network architecture for discrete-continuous hybrid action
space. Since the sparse reward function only provide a single re-
ward (i.e., the total EIG estimation) at the end of each interventionsequence, making the RL policy to train slowly and even unsuccess-
fully. Hence, we further propose a dense reward function, which
can provide fine-grained feedback to help the training process. Fur-
thermore, we demonstrate that the Q-function estimator in our
formulation can be learned using only trajectories sampled from
the prior, which can significantly reduce the time cost of training
process, enabling the real-world application of our method. Com-
pared to prior work in the field of ACD, our work utilizes trained
policy to select interventions, which non-myopically optimizes the
total EIG during the whole design process instead of iterative EIG
at each step and does not require updates of the posterior over
the SCM in each iteration during the training process. In addition,
our method, with trained policy, can rapidly select interventions
during inference and is well-suited for adaptive causal discovery
experiments.
The main contributions of our work can be summarized as:
•We formulate the active causal discovery problem as a POMDP,
and design a reasonable dense information gain estimation
reward signal.
•We introduce RL-CBED, which is to our knowledge, the first
reinforcement learning-based Bayesian active causal discov-
ery method and design a novel neural network architecture
for discrete-continuous hybrid action space.
•We prove theoretically that within our POMDP formulation,
the Q function estimator can be learned using trajectories
sampled only from the prior, which allows for training pro-
cess without updating causal discovery posterior model.
•We conduct experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic
datasets to compare our proposed method with baselines
empirically and the results demonstrates our the superiority
of our method.

2.1 Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design
Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) [ 6,27,32] is a prin-
cipled model-based framework for optimal experimental design
selection, and it has been successfully utilized in numerous scien-
tific research fields [ 42,50,52]. One notable development is the
emergence of sequential BOED methods [ 39], which adaptively se-
lect new experimental conditions based on the outcomes of previous
experiments. The conventional approaches for posterior inference
at each timestep include sequential Monte Carlo [ 7,8], variational
inference [ 11,12] and Laplace approximation [ 25,28]. Foster et
al. [10] amortized sequential BOED with a adaptive policy, enabling
researchers to efficiently allocate resources and obtain information
in real-time. Ivanova et al. [ 22] then extended it to implicit likeli-
hood and can practically perform real-time adaptive BOED with
implicit models. Some recent work has also focused sepcifically
on non-myopical strategies for sequential BOED. Huan et al. [ 21]
considered policy-based BOED and utilize approximate dynamic
programming to obtain a design policy for experimental designs.
Jiang et al. [ 23] proposed a batch-informed selection method and
obtain non-myopic approximations to the optimal experimental
policy. Besides, there are also some approaches considering RL-
based sequential BOED in both closed-form likelihood [ 5,44] and
intractable likelihood [26] settings.

2.2 Active Causal Discovery
Several studies have investigated active causal discovery [ 19,48,54],
where researchers perform intervention on the variables in the sys-
tem at each step, obtain interventional data and attempt to identify
the underlying causal relationship at minimal cost. One of the main-
stream approaches to active causal discovery is Bayesian Optimal
Experimental Design for Causal Discovery (BOECD), which is the
same setting as our work. Early methods [ 30,47] often make some
assumptions and consider simple settings such as discrete variables
and topologically ordered graphs. In recent years, BOECD-based
active causal discovery has been explored in different settings and
applications [ 15,33]. Agrawal et al. [ 2] proposed ABCD frame-
work which estimates MI with weighted importance sampling in
the continuous variable setting. Tigas et al. [ 46] utilized Bayesian
optimization to identify the intervention values and proposed an
algorithm for batch intervention setting. Annadani et al. [ 3] then
extended it to a gradient-based optimization procedure to acquire
a set of optimal intervention target-state pairs. Besides Bayesian
based methods, there are also other approaches to active causal
discovery [ 24,43,45,53]. A-ICP [ 14] is an active causal discovery
framwork based on ICP [ 37] which selects the intervention but
can not be utilized in the full graph discovery setting. AIT [ 41]
decides where to intervene by computing a score for all possible
intervention targets in a non-Bayesian framework.
3 PRELIMINARIES
3.1 Causality
One of the prominent mathematical models for representing causal
relationships between variables of interest is Structural Causal
Model (SCM). Here we introduce the relevant background briefly.
LetX={𝑋1,...,𝑋𝑑}be a set of𝑑observed variables. Each vari-
ables𝑋𝑖associates with a function, or mechanism, to generate the
variable as a function of its parents 𝑋pa(𝑖)and a noise variable 𝜖𝑖
with distribution 𝑃(𝜖𝑖):
𝑋𝑖B𝑓𝑖(Xpa(𝑖),𝜖𝑖), 𝑖∈{1,...,𝑑}. (1)
We consider a common form of 𝑓𝑖in this work, i.e., Gaussian additive
noise models (ANM):
𝑋𝑖B𝑓𝑖(Xpa(𝑖);𝛾𝑖)+𝜖𝑖, 𝜖𝑖∼N( 0,𝜎2
𝑖), (2)
where the mechanism 𝑓𝑖is parameterized by 𝛾𝑖and noise variance
𝜎2
𝑖. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) g=(V,E)is associated with
each SCM. The endogenous variables Xare indexed by the vertex set
V={1,...,𝑑}, and the edge 𝑗→𝑖exists if and only if 𝑋𝑗∈Xpa(𝑖).
Interventions. Based on an SCMMand its associated DAG g,
interventions, manipulations to some structural equations, can be de-
noted by do-operator [ 35] as𝑑𝑜({𝑋𝑖=𝑣𝑖}𝑖∈𝐼), which represents the
manipulation of deleting from the model {𝑋𝑖=𝑓𝑖(Xpa(𝑖),𝑈𝑖)}𝑖∈𝐼
all structural equations corresponding to variables whose index is
in𝐼and substituting{𝑋𝑖=𝑣𝑖}𝑖∈𝐼in the remaining equations. Then
the associated DAG gis also mutilated by cutting off the edges from
all parents of 𝑖∈𝐼to the node 𝑖.
3.2 Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design
Researchers aim to design informative experiments so that the out-
comes can help to uncover more information about the unknownunderlying process. Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED)
is a mathematically well-defined framework for describing the de-
sign process in a Bayesian manner. In BOED framework, the exper-
imental outcome 𝑦is modelled with an explicit likelihood 𝑝(𝑦|𝜃,𝜉)
and a prior belief 𝑝(𝜃)representing initial beliefs about the param-
eters of interest. After conducting the experiment 𝜉and observing
the outcome 𝑦, the belief is updated to the posterior 𝑝(𝜃|𝜉,𝑦). A
common setting is sequential experimental design, where the above
process iterates for 𝑇times. In each iteration 𝑡∈{1,...,𝑇}, an ex-
periment𝜉𝑡is selected and then conducted, yielding the outcome
𝑦𝑡.
Letℎ𝑡B{(𝜉1,𝑦1),...,(𝜉𝑡,𝑦𝑡)}be the history of design-outcome
pairs at time step 𝑡. Previous works have proposed optimizing a
policy𝜋:H→ Ξrather than optimizing designs directly, where
HandΞare the history and design spaces, respectively. The policy
determines the next experimental design 𝜉𝑡with the history ℎ𝑡−1,
i.e.,𝜉𝑡=𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1). The data generating process can be describe as
𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜃,𝜋)=𝑝(𝜃)𝑇Ö
𝑡=1𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝜃,𝜉𝑡). (3)
Then the total expected information gain for policy 𝜋over a se-
quence of𝑇experiments is
I𝑇(𝜋)=E𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜃,𝜋)[log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜃,𝜋)−log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜋)],(4)
where𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜋)=E𝑝(𝜃)[𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜃,𝜋)]. The total EIG does not con-
sider the intermediate posteriors and only calculates the entropy
reduction from the initial prior 𝑝(𝜃)to the final posterior 𝑝(𝜃|ℎ𝑇).
3.3 Reinforcement Learning
We introduce Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
for modelling the relationship between an agent and its environ-
ment, where the environment dynamics is decided by an MDP, and
the agent can only receive an observation instead of the underlying
state. Formally, a POMDP is a 7-tuple (S,A,P,𝑅,Ω,O,𝛾), where
Sis a set of states, Ais a set of actions, Pis transition dynamics
P:S×A×S→ [0,1],𝑅is reward function 𝑅:S×A→R,
Ωis a set of observations, Ois observation emission probability
O:S×Ω→[0,1], and𝛾is the discount factor. At each time step
𝑡, the environment is in a state 𝑠𝑡. The agent takes an action 𝑎𝑡and
then the environment transitions from state 𝑠𝑡to𝑠𝑡+1according
to the transition dynamics P(𝑠𝑡+1|𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡). The environment then
reveals to the agent a reward 𝑟𝑡=𝑅(𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡)and an observation
𝑜𝑡+1∼O(·|𝑠𝑡+1). The process repeats until the time step arrives 𝑇
for finite-horizon process. The goal for the agent is to take appro-
priate actions at each time step so that the expected cumulative
discounted reward EÍ𝑇−1
𝑡=0𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡
is maximized.
4 PROPOSED METHOD
In this section, we propose an Reinforcement Learning-based Causal
Bayesian Experimental Design method (also called RL-CBED for
short) to achieve expected information gain maximization after a
certain number of interventions. For active causal discovery, an ex-
periment is an intervention on variables X𝐼with values v𝐼, denoted
by𝜉B{(X𝐼,v𝐼)}=𝑑𝑜({𝑋𝑖=𝑣𝑖}𝑖∈𝐼).

Figure 2: Overview of RL-CBED. First we use observational data 𝑦0to perform causal discovery and get SCM hypotheses. At
each step𝑡, we concatenate data and previous action to get observation 𝑜𝑡and input it into RL policy. The output action 𝑎𝑡is
used to perform intervention on hypotheses and obtain interventional data 𝑦𝑡+1. We finally use calculated reward 𝑟𝑡to update
the network in RL policy.
4.1 POMDP Formulation
In order to optimize the total causal experimental design process
using deep reinforcement learning, we first need to cast the active
causal discovery problem as a POMDP, in which a policy can be
trained to decide where and how to intervene after observing the
intervention history and the outcomes of intervention experiments
at each step. In this section, we first introduce how to define states,
observations, actions, and transition dynamics in our settings and
leave the reward design to the next section.
State𝑠𝑡. We define the state 𝑠𝑡as a combination of the history
of interventions and outcomes until the previous step ℎ𝑡−1, the
causal graph g0discovered by the causal discovery model using
observational data, and 𝐿contrastive samples of the causal graphs
g1:𝐿, which are sampled from the same prior distribution 𝑝(g|D𝑜𝑏𝑠)
independently as g0and used to calculate contrastive bound as
defined later in the reward design. Formally, state 𝑠𝑡B(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿).
Note that in POMDP formulation, the RL agent cannot observe the
whole state 𝑠𝑡, and g0:𝐿is kept in the environment.
Observation 𝑜𝑡. At each time step, the RL agent can only ob-
serve the history ℎ𝑡−1={(𝑎𝑖,𝑦𝑖)}𝑡−1
𝑖=1, consisting of the previous
action (intervention target-value pair) 𝑎𝑖at each time step and the
interventional samples 𝑦𝑖collected under the intervention indicated
by𝑎𝑖, that is, observation 𝑜𝑡Bℎ𝑡−1and we set𝑜1=∅.
Action𝑎𝑡. We define action as 𝑎𝑡B(𝑖𝑡,𝑣𝑡). Action𝑎𝑡is the in-
tervention that the agent decides to perform at current time step. It
consists of the interventional target node 𝑋𝑖𝑡and the corresponding
interventional value 𝑣𝑡, that is, an intervention 𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖𝑡=𝑣𝑡).
Transition dynamics P. After the action 𝑎𝑡=(𝑖𝑡,𝑣𝑡)is chosen,
the state𝑠𝑡=(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿)transitions to 𝑠𝑡+1=(ℎ𝑡,g0:𝐿), where𝑦𝑡
is the samples obtained under the intervention indicated by 𝑎𝑡,
i.e.,𝑦𝑡∼𝑝(·|g0,𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖𝑡=𝑣𝑡)). Consequently, transition dynamics
𝑝(𝑠𝑡+1|𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡)=𝑝(𝑦𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,g0,𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖𝑡=𝑣𝑡)).Observation emission probability O. As described earilier, the
RL agent can only observe the history ℎ𝑡−1at each time step 𝑡, so
the observation emission probability Ofor state𝑠𝑡=(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿)is
simply described as 𝑝(𝑜𝑡|𝑠𝑡=(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿))= 1[𝑜𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1], where
1[·]is the indicator function.
4.2 Bayesian-driven Reward Design
In this section, we demonstrate how to design a reasonable reward
function that allows the RL agent to learn an intervention policy
that maximizes the information about underlying causality gained
in the multiple experiment setting. First we propose a naive sparse
reward function based on the estimator of total EIG. Then we im-
prove it and get a dense reward function to solve the sparse reward
signal problem in reinforcement learning.
4.2.1 Sparse Reward Function. As described eariler in Section 3.2,
we utilize the total expected information gain for policy 𝜋over a
sequence of 𝑇experimentsI𝑇(𝜋)to represent how much causal
relationship the policy 𝜋discover after 𝑇interventions. Since the
total EIG is intractable, Foster et al . [10] has proposed its upper
bound estimationUsNMC(𝜋), called sequential Nested Monte Carlo
(sNMC) estimation, to estimate the total EIG:
UsNMC(𝜋)=E𝑝(g0:𝐿)𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)"
log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)
1
𝐿+1Í𝐿
ℓ=1𝑝(ℎ𝑇|gℓ,𝜋)#
,(5)
where g0:𝐿∼𝑝(g|D𝑜𝑏𝑠)are sampled independently from the prior
given only observational data. Therefore, a naive reward design
approach is to only assign the total EIG estimation to the final step
of a sequence of interventions, that is,

Intuitively, the RL agent receives zero reward for all time steps
𝑡<𝑇until the final step to obtain the information gain of the
entire trajectory. Proposition 4.1 illustrates that following the above
formulation and the sparse reward function in Equation 6, the policy
optimized for the POMDP also solve the BOECD problem.
Proposition 4.1. LetM:(S,A,P,𝑅,Ω,O,𝛾)be a POMDP where
state𝑠𝑡=(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿), observation 𝑜𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1, action𝑎𝑡=(𝑖𝑡,𝑣𝑡),
transition dynamics P=𝑝(𝑦𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,g0,𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖𝑡=𝑣𝑡)), observation
emission probability O= 1[𝑜𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1], discount factor 𝛾=1and
reward𝑟𝑡follows Equation 6, then the expected cumulative discounted
reward
E𝜋"𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡#
=UsNMC(𝜋). (7)
See Appendix A.1 for proof. According to Proposition 4.1, it is
reasonable to utilize RL algorithm to solve this POMDP and the
trained policy that maximizes the expected return can be used in
the BOECD problem.
4.2.2 Dense Reward Function. In practice, sparse reward signal is
a key challenge for RL algorithms. The sparse reward signal above
is only provided by the environment at the final time step of an
episode, so it is hard for RL algorithms to associate the sequence of
previous actions with this final reward.
We now give the definition of our dense reward as follows
𝑟𝑡=log𝑝(𝑦𝑡|g0,𝑎𝑡)
−log"𝑡Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g1,𝑎𝑘)+···+𝑡Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g𝐿,𝑎𝑘)#
+log"𝑡−1Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g1,𝑎𝑘)+···+𝑡−1Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g𝐿,𝑎𝑘)#
.(8)
Under the dense reward formulation, the RL agent can receive
rewards after each action of intervention experimental design. The
dense reward formulation estimates the marginal expected informa-
tion gain of intervention 𝑎𝑡at time step 𝑡. Proposition 4.2 demon-
strates that the dense reward we propose in Equation 8 is equivalent
to the sparse reward in Equation 6 in terms of the returns of two
trajectories with the same state-action pairs.
Proposition 4.2 (Eqivalence of Dense and Sparse Rewards).
For a trajectoryT𝑠=(𝑠1,𝑎1,𝑟𝑠
1,...,𝑠𝑇,𝑎𝑇,𝑟𝑠
𝑇)using sparse rewards
in Equation 6 and a trajectory T𝑑=(𝑠1,𝑎1,𝑟𝑑
1,...,𝑠𝑇,𝑎𝑇,𝑟𝑑
𝑇)using
dense rewards in Equation 8 with the same state-action pairs during
the entire trajectory, the returns of two trajectories are the same, that
is,
𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑠
𝑡=𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑑
𝑡, (9)
where the discount factor 𝛾=1.See Appendix A.2 for proof. Proposition 4.2 provides a good
demonstration of the equivalence of dense and sparse rewards in
terms of the returns. Thus, the dense reward formulation assigns
the same total reward as the sparse reward for each trajectory. Com-
pared with the sparse reward, the reward formulation we define in
Equation 8 is nonzero for all time steps 𝑡and can provide a dense
reward signal for RL agent to learn intervention selection policy.
4.3 Architecture and Optimization of RL Policy
4.3.1 Network Structure. Since both the discrete intervention tar-
get and the continuous intervention value are selected in each time
step, it is a discrete-continuous hybrid action space problem in
the reinforcement learning literature. We introduce a novel neu-
ral network architecture, which is designed for the scenario with
discrete-continuous hybrid action space in our setting.
Suppose that the number of nodes in the causal graph is 𝑛. At
each timestep, we need to select one node out of 𝑛nodes and deter-
mine the intervention value for that node in the range of available
values. In our architecture, we design a discrete-action target net-
work𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 and a continuous-action value network 𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 , which
share a base LSTM feature extractor 𝐸that converts observation
𝑜𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1into dense vector representations h𝑡=𝐸(𝑜𝑡). We first
input h𝑡into the deterministic continuous-action value network,
which outputs a vector vwith length𝑛, representing the correspond-
ing intervention values for each node, that is, v𝑡=𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒(h𝑡). Then
we concatenate the observation representations h𝑡and the output
of continuous-action value network v𝑡, and input the concatenated
vector into the discrete-action target network, which outputs the
optimal action-value function 𝑄∗of selecting each node with the
corresponding previously selected value, q𝑡=𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡(h𝑡;v𝑡). Fi-
nally, we use a softmax layer to change 𝑄∗value to a action selection
distribution and sample action (𝑘𝑡,v𝑡[𝑘𝑡])from the distribution
softmax(q𝑡).
4.3.2 Overall Optimization. We use Q-learning algorithm to update
the parameter of target network 𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 . Specifically, we calculate
TD error between predicted Q value of action q𝑡[𝑘𝑡]and TD target
𝑟𝑡+𝛾·q𝑡+1[𝑘𝑡+1]and use least squares loss as loss function. We also
add an entropy regularization term to encourage the exploration
during the training process. The value network update loss can be
written as:
L𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 =1
2
q𝑡[𝑘𝑡]−(𝑟𝑡+𝛾·q𝑡+1[𝑘𝑡+1])2
+𝛼·H(softmax(q𝑡)),
(10)
where the entropy of policy H(𝜋)=−Í
𝜋𝑎∈𝜋𝜋𝑎log𝜋𝑎represents
the randomness of a policy 𝜋and𝛼is used to control the trade-off
between exploration and exploitation.
Furthermore, in order to update the parameter of value network
𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 , we use deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm and
the value network update loss can be written as:
L𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 =−𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1q𝑡[𝑖]. (11)
A summary of our proposed algorithm is given in Algorithm 1.

4.4 Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we discuss a key elegant property of our proposed
approach similar to Blau et al . [5]. We show that the RL agent can
interact with the environment with no need for updating causal dis-
covery posterior model during the training process, which enables
a substantial reduction in time cost.
Theorem 4.3 (Q Function Estimator from Priors). LetMbe
a POMDP where state 𝑠𝑡=(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿), observation 𝑜𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1, action
𝑎𝑡=(𝑖𝑡,𝑣𝑡)and the transition dynamics P=𝑝(𝑦𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,g0,𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖𝑡=
𝑣𝑡)). For an arbitrary policy 𝜋, the Q function estimator ˆ𝑄𝜋can be
learned using trajectories sampled only from the prior 𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜋,g0:𝐿),
where g0:𝐿∼𝑝(·|D𝑜𝑏𝑠).
See Appendix A.3 for proof. Theorem 4.3 demonstrates that
during the training process, there is no need to update the causal
discovery posterior model with interventional data at each timestep
and the value function can be learned using only samples from the
prior, that is, the causal graph g0:𝐿inferred using only observational
dataD𝑜𝑏𝑠. With this property, the time cost of training process of
RL policy can be reduced significantly, which enables our method
to be applied in real scenarios.
5 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we conduct experiments to investigate the following
research questions. RQ1: How is the performance of our RL-CBED
compared with other baselines on both synthetic and real world-
inspired semi-synthetic datasets? RQ2: How is the time cost of
our RL-CBED compared with other baselines during the inference
process? RQ3: Is our approach robust to changes in different various
factors, including intervention steps and MEC size? RQ4: Comparedwith sparse reward function, to what extent does our proposed
dense reward function help the reinforcement learning training
process converge?
5.1 Experimental Setup
We evaluate our proposed method on three commonly used causal
discovery datasets, including Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph, Scale-Free
(SF) graph and DREAM.
5.1.1 Baselines. We compare our RL-CBED with several existing
competitive methods of active causal discovery as follows.
•Random-Fixed: For each intervention, select the target
node uniformly at random, and set the value of the interven-
tion to a fixed value. In the experiments, we fix this value to
0, as introduced in [2, 46].
•Random-Random: Select both the target node and its as-
sociated interventional value uniformly and randomly, as
introduced in [3, 48].
•ABCD [2]: Active Budgeted Causal Design (ABCD) strategy
estimates MI with weighted importance sampling. It selects
only intervention targets and sets intervention values to a
fixed value.
•AIT [41]: Active Intervention Targeting (AIT) decides where
to intervene by computing a score for all possible interven-
tion targets in a non-Bayesian framework. It also fixes inter-
vention values like ABCD strategy.
•CBED [46]: A Bayesian optimization-based black-box method
to optimize over both intervention target and value with an
MI estimator similar to Bayesian Active Learning by Dis-
agreement (BALD) [20].
•DiffCBED [3]: A gradient-based causal experimental de-
sign method which selects the optimal intervention with the
largest estimated information gain at each time step.
5.1.2 Tasks. We conduct experiments on several common causal
discovery tasks, including synthetic and semi-synthetic graphs.
For synthetic graphs, we generate two types of synthetic causal
graphs, Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph [ 9] and Scale-Free (SF) graph [ 4],
each with 10, 20 and 30 nodes. For real-world inspired dataset, we
use DREAM [ 16], which is a family of benchmarks designed to
assess causal discovery algorithms. In our experiments, we use two
sub-datasets Ecoli andYeast networks each with 10 nodes as the
true causal graph and simulate the mechanisms, which is the same
setting as described in [ 3]. We provide more details in Appendix B.1.
5.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. We utilize several different metrics to as-
sess the discrepancy between the causal graphs found by method af-
ter several interventional experiments and the ground-truth causal
graph, in order to demonstrate to what extent the intervention ex-
periments designed using different methods reveal the underlying
causal relationships. The metrics include F1-score, Structural Ham-
ming Distance (SHD), Structural Intervention Distance (SID) and
Interventional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (i-MMD). We provide
more details about these metrics in Appendix B.2.
5.2 Implementation Details
We implement all baselines and our RL-CBED based on PyTorch 2.1
and Jax 0.4.19. We use the i-MMD metric as a reference to search
 
844Policy-Based Bayesian Active Causal Discovery with Deep Reinforcement Learning KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
for the best hyper-parameters for all baselines and our method.
We utilize DAG-bootstrap [ 13] with GIES [ 18] as our posterior
causal discovery model and set the bootstrap number to 30. All
experiments are implemented on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and
Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5118 CPU @ 2.30GHz. We provide more
details and hyper-parameters for reproducibility in Appendix C.
5.3 Overall Performance (RQ1)
Table 1 shows the comparison of overall performance on ER graph
and SF graph with 10, 20, and 30 nodes. Our observations about the
experiment results are as follows.
First, our method RL-CBED outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines consistently across all datasets for most metrics. Specifi-
cally, our proposed method can achieve significant improvement
in terms of i-MMD metrics after specified number of interventions,
which reveals a better estimation of both the ground-truth causal
graph and the corresponding conditional distributions. The im-
provement demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-CBED in selecting
reasonable interventions and can be attributed to the non-myopic
intervention selection policy compared with previous heuristic and
myopic methods such as CBED and DiffCBED. As for F1 score, SHD
and SID metrics, which consider only the causal graph, our method
also typically outperforms other existing methods. This suggests
that RL-CBED can offer valuable insights and advisable selections
in a wide range of graph data.
Second, previous methods exhibit a substantial decline in perfor-
mance when dealing with high-dimensional graph data, while our
method shows scalability as the graph size changes. Although some
previous methods work well and are comparable to our method in
10-node graph, they suffer from a performance drop as the graph
size scale to 20 or 30 nodes. Taking CBED as an example, for ER
graph with 10 nodes, its i-MMD performance is only 2.1% worse
than RL-CBED. However, when the graph size scales to 20 nodes, it
suffers performance drop for i-MMD metric, which is 7.7% worse
than RL-CBED, and even more serious for ER graph with 30 nodes,
i.e., 16.1% worse than our method. A possible explanation is that
when the previous methods try to find the optimal selection of inter-
vention at each step on a large size graph, the updated causal graph
distribution of the posterior model after each step is often more
different from that in the case of global optimal solution. Therefore,
the gap between the local optimal selection and the global optimal
selection after each step update will be wider for high-dimensional
graph data.
Finally, methods with fixed intervention value often do not per-
form as well as methods that strategically select intervention val-
ues. Fixed value selection strategies includes Random-Fixed, ABCD,
AIT, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes in certain situations.
By strategically choosing intervention values, other methods can
adapt to the specific context and make more effective decisions.
This flexibility allows for better performance and improved overall
outcomes.
Evaluation on Real-World Inspired Data. Besides experi-
ments on synthetic datasets, we also perform experiments on real
world-inspired DREAM dataset. Table 2 shows the comparison of
overall performance on Ecoli and Yeast sub-dataset of DREAM. For
both sub-datasets, RL-CBED outperforms other baselines in terms

of most metrics, especially i-MMD. Our method’s superior perfor-
mance across various metrics and datasets highlights its potential
for practical applications in real-world scenarios.
5.4 Analysis of Time Cost (RQ2)
To analyze the time cost of our proposed method, we conduct exper-
iments in different settings. Specifically, we record the intervention
inference time of different methods for 5 intervention steps on
10-node graphs and 10 intervention steps on 20-node graphs. We
present the results in Figure 3. From the results, we can find that
the time cost of optimization-based methods including CBED and
DiffCBED is significantly higher than other methods. In particular,
DiffCBED trains a neural network at each step, resulting in a very
high time cost. However, the inference time cost of our method
is nearly the same as random strategies and still lower than that
of optimization-based methods after adding training time. This
suggests that our method can reduce time costs significantly while
improving performance, making it suitable for real-world adaptive
applications with inference time limits.
5.5 Further Study of Various Factors (RQ3)
In order to explore the robustness of our proposed method, we
perform further experiments to discuss the influence of various
factors on RL-CBED and other methods. We consider different
intervention steps and MEC size, which are common in real-world
scientific research. We believe that robust active causal discovery
algorithm should work well in such different settings.
5.5.1 Influence of Intervention Steps. We choose ER graph with 20
nodes for the study of influence of intervention steps. Specifically,
we conduct experiments with {0,5,10,15,20}intervention steps on
ER graph with a large MEC size (more than 100) and report the
performance comparison in Figure 4. Based on the experimental

isting methods across different intervention steps. Particularly with
a large number of intervention steps, our method yields superior
results, indicating its ability to identify the optimal intervention
path non-myopically and improve active causal discovery.
5.5.2 Influence of MEC Size. We choose SF graphs with 10 nodes
for the study of influence of MEC size. Specifically, we set the MEC
size of true causal graph to {10,20,30,40,60,80}and report the
performance comparison of RL-CBED and other methods in Fig-

graph increases, it becomes more challenging to recover the real
graph in general. Across various MEC sizes, our method RL-CBED
consistently performs the best, demonstrating its robustness for
graphs of different MEC sizes. Other methods perform similarly to
RL-CBED when the MEC size is small, but their performance de-
clines as the MEC size increases. This indicates that other methods
have limitations for graphs with large MEC sizes, while RL-CBED
continues to perform well.
5.6 Ablation Study (RQ4)
We further explore the influence of our proposed sparse and dense
reward design and compare reward convergence process and fi-
nal model performance under two different reward formulation.
Although we have proved the equivalence of sparse and dense re-
ward in Proposition 4.2, i.e., the same total reward for the same
trajectory under two reward formulation, sparse reward formula-
tions often suffer from slow learning and even an inability to learn,
which has been widely discussed in RL literature. We choose ER
graphs with 20 nodes in the ablation study and report the average
reward result over five runs in Figure 6. From the reward curve,
using dense rewards can eventually converge to a higher value than

sparse rewards. This implies that while sparse and dense rewards
are theoretically equivalent, dense rewards converge more easily
to the optimal solution in practice.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper we introduced RL-CBED–the first policy-based ac-
tive causal discovery method that can non-myopically select both
targets and values for intervention experiments. By training a RL
policy network upfront, RL-CBED also allows selecting interven-
tion rapidly during inference and is suitable for adaptive causal
discovery experiment scenarios. We first formulate active causal dis-
covery process as a POMDP and propose a dense information gain
estimation-based reward function. We also prove theoretically that
our formulation allows for training process without updating causal
discovery posterior model. We further introduce a novel network
architecture designed for the scenario with discrete-continuous hy-
brid action space in our setting. Extensive experiments conducted
on both synthetic and real-world inspired datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method across various metrics. Future work will
include exploring the cost and improvement of updating causal
discovery posterior model at each step and applying our approach
to complex real-world active causal discovery scenarios.

A OMITTED PROOFS
A.1 Proof of Proposition 4.1
Proof. We first plug in the definition of UsNMC , meaning that
we need to show that
E𝜋"𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡#
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿)𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)"
log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)
1
𝐿+1Í𝐿
ℓ=1𝑝(ℎ𝑇|gℓ,𝜋)#
,
where g0:𝐿∼𝑝(g)independently. We then plug in the formulation
of the POMDP in the LHS and get
𝐿𝐻𝑆=E𝑝(g0:𝐿)Î𝑇
𝑡=1[𝑝(𝑦𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,g0,𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖𝑡=𝑣𝑡))𝜋(𝑎𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1)]"𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡#
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿)𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)"𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡#
.
Note that the distribution of the expectation taken over in the LHS
is the same as that in the RHS. Therefore we need to show that the
terms inside the expectation are equal, that is,
𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡=log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)
1
𝐿+1Í𝐿
ℓ=1𝑝(ℎ𝑇|gℓ,𝜋).
Plugging in 𝛾=1and the definition of reward function in Equa-
tion 6, we get
𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝛾𝑡𝑟𝑡=log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)−log𝐿∑︁
ℓ=1𝑝(ℎ𝑇|gℓ,𝜋),
which is identical to the RHS and concludes the proof. □
A.2 Proof of Proposition 4.2
Proof. To prove the proposition, we first notice that the LHS
equals𝑟𝑠
𝑇since𝑟𝑠
𝑡=0for𝑡<𝑇according to Equation 6, that is,
𝐿𝐻𝑆=log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)−log𝐿∑︁
ℓ=1𝑝(ℎ𝑇|gℓ,𝜋).
We now foucs on the RHS and plug in the definition of 𝑟𝑑

𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g𝐿,𝑎𝑘)# !
.

Note that we can collapse the telescoping sum here. Hence we get
𝑅𝐻𝑆=𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1log𝑝(𝑦𝑡|g0,𝑎𝑡)
−log"𝑇Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g1,𝑎𝑘)+···+𝑇Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑘|g𝐿,𝑎𝑘)#
Recall that we have made the assumption of BOED data generating
process that 𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(ℎ𝑇|𝜃,𝜋)=𝑝(𝜃)Î𝑇
𝑡=1𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝜃,𝜉𝑡)in Equation 3.
We can therefore rewrite the RHS
𝑅𝐻𝑆=log𝑇Ö
𝑡=1𝑝(𝑦𝑡|g0,𝑎𝑡)−log𝐿∑︁
ℓ=1𝑇Ö
𝑘=1𝑝(𝑦𝑡|gℓ,𝑎𝑘)
=log𝑝(ℎ𝑇|g0,𝜋)−log𝐿∑︁
ℓ=1𝑝(ℎ𝑇|gℓ,𝜋),
which is equivalent to the LHS we get earlier and concludes the
proof. □
A.3 Proof of Theorem 4.3
Proof. When we train the estimator ˆ𝑄𝜋, we need to minimize
an loss taken expectation with respect to trajectories generated by
the policy𝜋, that is,
E𝑝(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡|𝜋)[L(ˆ𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡),𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡))],
whereLis a loss function. In practice, we estimate the expectation
by Monte Carlo sampling. To analyze what we need in order to
evaluate𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡), we first need to derive the Bellman equation
for the Q function in our POMDP M, that is,
𝑄𝜋(𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡)=E𝑆𝑡+1,𝐴𝑡+1[𝑟𝑡+𝛾·𝑄𝜋(𝑆𝑡+1,𝐴𝑡+1)|𝑆𝑡=𝑠𝑡,𝐴𝑡=𝑎𝑡].
In our formulation, state 𝑠𝑡=(ℎ𝑡−1,g0:𝐿)is a function of history
ℎ𝑡−1and underlying causal parameters g0:𝐿, hence we substitute
𝑠𝑡with two separate covariates ℎ𝑡−1andg0:𝐿in the following
derivation. Since g0:𝐿is sample from the posterior distribution
𝑝(g|ℎ𝑡−1)at each time step, we separate g0:𝐿from the covariates of
Q-function and introduce a state-action-parameter value function
𝐽𝜋, that is, we need to show that
𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)=E𝐻𝑡,𝐴𝑡+1[𝑟𝑡+𝛾·𝑄𝜋(𝐻𝑡,𝐴𝑡+1)|𝐻𝑡=ℎ𝑡,𝐴𝑡=𝑎𝑡].
under the condition that we consider Q function as the expectation
of the state-action-parameter value function 𝐽𝜋, that is,
𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)=Eg0:𝐿∼𝑝(g|ℎ𝑡−1)𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿).
We now focus on the state-action-parameter value function 𝐽𝜋:
𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)=EÎ𝑇−1
𝑖=𝑡[𝑝(𝑦𝑖|𝑎𝑖,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑖+1|ℎ𝑖)]"𝑇∑︁
𝑖=𝑡𝛾𝑡−𝑖𝑟𝑖#
=E𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)"
𝑟𝑡+𝛾·
EÎ𝑇−1
𝑖=𝑡+1[𝑝(𝑦𝑖|𝑎𝑖,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑖+1|ℎ𝑖)]"𝑇∑︁
𝑖=𝑡+1𝛾𝑡−𝑖𝑟𝑖# #
=E𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑟𝑡+𝛾·𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)].We then plug the recursive equation of 𝐽𝜋into the expression of
𝑄𝜋and get
𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑟𝑡+𝛾·
𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)]
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑟𝑡]+𝛾·
E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)].
Then we need to show that 𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)is equal to𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1)
in expectation since the Bellman equation for Q-function we need
to prove is a recursive equation of 𝑄𝜋. We can get
E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)]
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)]
=E𝑝(𝑦𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1)]
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1)].
So we proved in expectation 𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)is equal to𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1).
Then we plug this result back to the above 𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)equation
and get
𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑟𝑡]+𝛾·
E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝐽𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1,g0:𝐿)]
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑟𝑡]+𝛾·
E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1)]
=E𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)[𝑟𝑡+𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡,𝑎𝑡+1)].
So we proved the recursive expression for Q-function, i.e., the Bell-
man function for Q-function. According to the above discussion, in
order to evaluate 𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡), we need to sample trajectories from
the distribution 𝑝(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡|𝜋)𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡),
which is difficult and time-consuming, since it includes the posterior
𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1). We can further simplify the intractable distribution
and get
𝑝(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡|𝜋)𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)
=𝑝(𝑦𝑡|𝑎𝑡,g0:𝐿)𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)𝑝(𝑎𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,𝜋)𝑝(ℎ𝑡−1|𝜋)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)
=𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡)𝑝(𝑦𝑡,𝑎𝑡|ℎ𝑡−1,𝜋)𝑝(ℎ𝑡−1|𝜋)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)
=𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡)𝑝(ℎ𝑡,ℎ𝑡−1|𝜋)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)
=𝑝(g0:𝐿,ℎ𝑡|𝜋)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡).
Therefore we can use trajectories sampled from the distribution
𝑝(g0:𝐿,ℎ𝑡|𝜋)𝜋(𝑎𝑡+1|ℎ𝑡)to evaluate𝑄𝜋(ℎ𝑡−1,𝑎𝑡)and then learn the
Q-function estimator without updating the posterior 𝑝(g0:𝐿|ℎ𝑡−1)
during the training process, which concludes the proof. □
B EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
B.1 Tasks
We will now provide additional details about tasks used in our
experiments.
Synthetic graphs. We generate two types of synthetic causal
graphs, Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph [ 9] and Scale-Free (SF) graph [ 4].
For each kind of graphs, we generate different sizes of graphs,
including 10 nodes, 20 nodes and 30 nodes. ER graph is a random
graph with𝑛vertices generated by connecting each pair of vertices
with a probability 𝑝. In our experiments, we set 𝑝=0.2. SF graph
is a random graph with a degree distribution following power law.
In SF graph, a minority of vertices possess a large number of edges,
while the vast majority of vertices have relatively fewer edges. We

DREAM. DREAM [ 16] is the abbreviation for Dialogue for Re-
verse Engineering Assessments and Methods, which is a family of
benchmarks designed to assess causal discovery algorithms, specif-
ically focusing on the protein signaling regulatory networks within
a single cell. The dataset is created by utilizing a series of ODEs and
SDEs to model the reverse-engineered networks of individual cells.
The dataset is generated with GeneNetWeaver v3.12, a simulator of
gene regulatory networks based on SDEs. In our experiments, we
use two sub-datasets Ecoli andYeast networks each with 10 nodes
as the true causal graph and simulate the mechanisms, which is the
same setting as described in [3].
B.2 Evaluation Metrics
We will now provide additional details about four evaluation metrics
used in our experiments.F1-score: We consider a binary classification task of whether
each edge of the ground-truth causal graph is present in the inferred
causal graph or not, and take an expectation of F1 score over the
graphs sampled from the posterior model.
SHD [1,49]: Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) considers
two DAGs and counts how many edges do not coincide. In our
experiments, we consider the expected SHD between the graphs
sampled from the posterior model and the ground truth causal
graph, i.e.,E−SHD BEg∼𝑝(G|D)[SHD(g,˜g)].
SID [36]: Structural Intervention Distance (SID) is based on a
graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two
DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements.
It counts the number of (𝑖,𝑗)such that the interventional distri-
bution𝑝(𝑥𝑗|do(𝑋𝑖=ˆ𝑥𝑖))is falsely estimated using the inferred
graphs with respect to the true causal graph. In our experiments,
we consider the expected SID, E−SID, as we introduced in SHD.
i-MMD [17]: Interventional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (i-
MMD) distance evaluates the interventional distribution induced
by both the causal graph structure and the corresponding condi-
tional distributions. It is defined as MMD distance between the
ground-truth interventional distribution and the interventional dis-
tribution induced by posterior sample gand𝜃. In our experiments,
we calculate the expected i-MMD over posterior samples, interven-
tional targets and values and use the median heuristic for kernel
choice as described in [17].
C IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
We tune the hyper-parameters of our model carefully and list the
adopted value for ER graphs with 20 nodes in Table 3. To make
training process more stable, we also use soft update tricks, i.e.,
learning two networks for each network and updating parameters
with a Polyak averaging factor 𝜏for copying target weights.
