ABSTRACT
Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) have the ability to cap-
ture both the graph topology and dynamic dependencies of inter-
actions within a graph over time. There has been a growing need
to explain the predictions of TGNN models due to the difficulty
in identifying how past events influence their predictions. Since
the explanation model for a static graph cannot be readily applied
to temporal graphs due to its inability to capture temporal depen-
dencies, recent studies proposed explanation models for temporal
graphs. However, existing explanation models for temporal graphs
rely on post-hoc explanations, requiring separate models for predic-
tion and explanation, which is limited in two aspects: efficiency and
accuracy of explanation. In this work, we propose a novel built-in
explanation framework for temporal graphs, called Self-Explainable
Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck
(TGIB). TGIB provides explanations for event occurrences by in-
troducing stochasticity in each temporal event based on the Infor-
mation Bottleneck theory. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of TGIB in terms of both the link prediction performance
and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. This is the
first work that simultaneously performs prediction and explanation
for temporal graphs in an end-to-end manner. The source code of
TGIB is available at https://github.com/sang-woo-seo/TGIB.

1 INTRODUCTION
Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) possess the capabil-
ity to capture interactions over time in graph-structured data and
demonstrate high utility in areas such as user-item interaction in
e-commerce [ 15] and friend relationships in social networks [ 6,21].
TGNNs incorporate both temporal dynamics and graph topology in
their approach and focus on learning time-dependent node repre-
sentation to predict future evolutions [ 3,24,40]. However, TGNN
models are considered as black boxes with limited transparency due
to the inability to discern how past events influence outcomes. Offer-
ing insights based on the logic of predictions in TGNN contributes
to an improved comprehension of the model’s decision-making
and provides rationality for predictions. Explainability for TGNN
can be applied in high-risk situations such as healthcare forecast-
ing [ 2,14] and fraud detection [ 23,29] to enhance the model’s
reliability, and assists in examining and mitigating issues related to
privacy, fairness, and safety in real-world applications [5].
Explainability aims to provide users with evidence within the
data that influenced a model prediction. With the emerging neces-
sity for explainability, explanation models for static graphs have
been actively studied in recent times [ 13,16,41]. These models
induce perturbations in the input of the model to detect the nodes
and edges, which significantly impact the final prediction. However,
these models cannot be easily generalized to temporal graphs due
to the high dynamicity of temporal graphs. Specifically, explanation
models for static graphs cannot capture the graph topology that is
dynamic in nature [ 40,42]. For example, in a temporal graph, multi-
ple events may occur over time between the same pair of nodes, and
these events may have different importance depending on when
the event occurred. In other words, events that occurred a long
time ago may have less influence on the current event compared to
events that occurred more recently.
Recently, T-GNNExplainer [ 39] attempted to explain the model
predictions on temporal graphs. Specifically, T-GNNExplainer con-
sists of a navigator that learns inductive relationships between
target events (those that are to be predicted) and candidate events
(those that may serve as reasons for the prediction), and an explorer
that explores the optimal combinations of candidate events for each

target event based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [ 28] (upper
part of Figure 1). T-GNNExplainer is a post-hoc explanation method
because explanations are generated based on a pretrained base
model (i.e., TGNN). Despite its effectiveness, T-GNNExplainer has
two major drawbacks that originate from its post-hoc manner of
generating explanations. First, since a temporal graph consistently
encounter changes in the topology due to its dynamic nature, the
base model needs to be consistently retrained. This results in the
repeated retraining of the explanation model (i.e., navigator and ex-
plorer) based on the retrained base model (i.e., TGNN), which makes
T-GNNExplainer inefficient especially when the base model is large.
The complexity issue aggravates as the explanations are generated
based on MCTS, which is a highly inefficient search algorithm.
Second, since post-hoc explanation methods provide explanations
by examining the behavior of an already trained base model, it
becomes challenging to fully comprehend the learning process of
the base model, and to provide accurate explanations [45].
As a solution to address the drawbacks of post-hoc explanation
methods when applied to temporal graphs, we propose to allow
the model to simultaneously perform both predictions and expla-
nations in temporal graphs by generating intrinsic explanations
within the model itself (i.e., built-in explanation method) (lower part
of Figure 1). Existing post-hoc explanation methods for temporal
graphs such as T-GNNExplainer focus on deriving subgraphs that
generate predictions as similar as possible to the predictions of the
base model for the target event. On the other hand, since our pro-
posed built-in explanation method does not have a base model, we
induce interactions between the target event representation at the
current timestamp and the candidate event representations at past
timestamps to extract the importance probability of each candidate
event. To consider the interaction of representations at different
timestamps, we generate time-aware representations by taking into
account the time spans between the target event and candidate
events. The time-aware representations facilitates our model to
identify important candidate events that are used as explanations
for the model predictions. Our goal is to detect significant past
events in temporal graphs based on the constructed time-aware
representations.
To this end, we propose a novel built-in explanation framework
for temporal graphs, called Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Net-
works based on Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). The mainidea is to build an end-to-end model that can simultaneously gener-
ate predictions for temporal graphs along with explanations based
on the Information Bottleneck (IB) approach, which enables the
model to detect important subgraphs by leveraging the time-aware
representations. Specifically, TGIB considers the interaction be-
tween the target event and candidate events to extract important
candidate events, eventually predicting the occurrence of the target
event. We formalize the prediction process for temporal graphs
with the IB to restrict the flow of information from candidate
events to predictions by injecting stochasticity into edges [ 26].
The stochasticity for label-relevant components decreases during
training, whereas the stochasticity for label-irrelevant components
is maintained. This difference in stochasticity eventually provides
explanations for the occurrence of the target events. We expect
improved generalization performance of TGIB by penalizing the
amount of information from input data.
We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the prediction
performance and the explainability of TGIB in the event occurrence
prediction task. Our results show that TGIB outperforms existing
link prediction models in both transductive and inductive environ-
ments. We also evaluated the explainability of TGIB in capturing
the label information by evaluating its prediction performance with
only the detected explanation graphs. We also demonstrate that
explanation graphs with varying sparsities exhibit a higher expla-
nation performance than existing explanation models. Overall, our
results show that TGIB not only significantly improves the perfor-
mance of the event occurrence prediction, but also provides superior
performance in terms of explanations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to simultaneously perform predictions and
explanations in temporal graphs.
In summary, our main contributions are summarized as follows:
•We propose an explainable graph neural network model for
temporal graphs that can simultaneously perform prediction
and explanation.
•We provide a theoretical background of TGIB based on the IB
framework regarding the extraction of important past events
for predicting the occurrence of the target event.
•Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGIB outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both link prediction per-
formance and explainability.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Temporal Graph Neural Networks
Unlike ordinary Graph Neural Networks for a static graph, TGNNs
produce dynamic node embeddings from a temporal graph evolving
with a series of events. Early methods [ 4,11,32] used RNN-based
architectures to produce temporal node embeddings by only consid-
ering nodes involved in each of specific events. As these methods
merely use direct connectivity represented as a single event, the
Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) [ 33] was adopted in recent meth-
ods for modeling more complex spatial and temporal relationships.
TGAT [ 40] applied SAM for simultaneous modeling of both spatial
and temporal relationships with functional time encodings based
on Bochner’s theorem. TGN [ 24] first updates the node memory for
temporal dependency by using an RNN-based model and computes
 
2573Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on

node embeddings by a SAM-based model with spatial and temporal
information similar to [ 40]. TCL [ 36] also utilized the SAM-based
architecture considering both spatial and temporal dependencies
while using a contrastive learning scheme by regarding an inter-
acted node as a positive sample. On the other hand, GraphMixer [ 3]
showed effectiveness with a simple MLP-based architecture and
argued neither RNN nor SAM is mandatory for TGNNs.
2.2 Graph Information Bottleneck
As the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle enables a model to ex-
tract information within the input data that is relevant to the target
(i.e., label) information, it has been widely adopted in the various
fields of machine learning [ 1,7,19]. Inspired by their successes,
recent studies regarding the IB principle on graph-structured data
were proposed. GIB [ 38] extended the IB principle on GNNs by
extracting both minimal and sufficient information from both the
graph structure and node features. Extending this, GIB [ 44] uti-
lized the IB principle for recognizing an important subgraph (i.e.,
IB-Graph) within the input graph, and then applied the IB-Graph
for improving the graph classification performance. Additionally,
VGIB [ 43] utilized learnable random noise injection in the subgraph
recognition process to enable flexible subgraph compression. Mean-
while, CGIB [ 12] applied the graph information bottleneck in molec-
ular relational learning by finding a core subgraph of one molecule
based on the paired molecule and the target label. Furthermore,
PGIB [ 25] approached the information bottleneck principle from
a prototype perspective to provide prototypes with the subgraph
from the input graph which is important for model prediction.
2.3 GNN Explainability
Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to be
effective on graph data [ 10,34], analyzing the reason of the predic-
tion and the decision-making process of these models has been a
long-standing challenge due to their complex architectures. For this
reason, approaches for explainable AI (XAI) have been recently pro-
posed to understand black-box GNNs [ 16,22,35,41]. Despite their
effectiveness, as these approaches are post-hoc methods, they are
both ineffective and inefficient when changes occur not only in the
training data but also the trained model to be explained. Therefore,
self-explainable (i.e., built-in ) [17,25,45] approaches have been re-
cently gained attention. They contain an explanatory module inside
the model to make predictions and explanations simultaneously,
addressing the limitations of post-hoc approaches. However, all the
aforementioned methods are designed for static graphs, and can-
not be readily applied to temporal graphs due to their dynamicity.
Recently, T-GNNExplainer [ 39] is proposed to give an explanation
on TGNNs trained on temporal graphs, which, however, has major
drawbacks due to its post-hoc manner as mentioned in Section 1. Ad-
ditionally, STExplainer [ 30] generates separate explanation graphs
for spatial and temporal graphs in traffic and crime prediction. How-
ever, to explain event occurrence predictions in a way that is easy
for humans to understand, it is necessary to generate a comprehen-
sive explanation graph as a set of temporal events. To this end, we
propose TGIB that can simultaneously generate predictions and
explanations in temporal graphs by detecting past events that are
important for the predictions based on the IB principle.3 PRELIMINARIES
3.1 Temporal Graph Model
A temporal graph contains a series of continuous events 𝑆={𝑒1,𝑒2,···}
with timestamps, where 𝑒𝑖={𝑢𝑖,𝑣𝑖,𝑡𝑖,att𝑖}indicates an interaction
event between node 𝑢𝑖and𝑣𝑖at timestamp 𝑡𝑖with edge attribute
att𝑖. The event set 𝑆composes a temporal graph G=(V,E), where
Eis regarded as edges with timestamps and Vrepresents the nodes
included in E. Since the definitions of VandEare interdependent,
we consider a temporal graph Gas a set of events. We define G𝑘as
the graph constructed immediately before the timestamp 𝑡𝑘which
includes all events {𝑒1,𝑒2,···,𝑒𝑘−1}excluding𝑒𝑘. Let𝑓denote a
self-explainable temporal graph model that we aim to learn. The
model𝑓simultaneously predicts the occurrence of interactions
between two nodes at a certain timestamp, and explains the rea-
son for its prediction regarding the occurrence or absence of the
event𝑒𝑘. The output of the model 𝑓, i.e.,𝑓(G𝑘)[𝑒𝑘], consists of two
components: the label prediction indicating whether the event 𝑒𝑘
is present or absent, i.e., ˆ𝑌, and an explanation for the presence or
absence of𝑒𝑘, i.e.,R𝑘∈G𝑘, whereG𝑘is the𝐿-hop computation
graph of𝑒𝑘, andR𝑘is a subgraph ofG𝑘considered as important
events. Note thatG𝑘of𝑒𝑘={𝑢𝑘,𝑣𝑘,𝑡𝑘,att𝑘}is a combination of
the𝐿-hop computation graphs of node 𝑢𝑘and node𝑣𝑘.
3.2 Graph Information Bottleneck
The mutual information denoted as 𝐼(𝑋;𝑌)between two random
variables𝑋and𝑌is formally defined as:
𝐼(𝑋;𝑌)=∫
𝑋∫
𝑌𝑝(𝑥,𝑦)log𝑝(𝑥,𝑦)
𝑝(𝑥)𝑝(𝑦)d𝑥d𝑦. (1)
Given an input denoted as 𝑋and its corresponding label 𝑌, the
Information Bottleneck (IB) [ 31] aims to optimize the following
objective function in order to derive a bottleneck variable 𝑍as:
min
𝑍−𝐼(𝑌;𝑍)+𝛽𝐼(𝑋;𝑍), (2)
where𝛽enables the regulation of the balance between two terms
as the Lagrange multiplier. The IB principle has found recent appli-
cation in learning a bottleneck graph, referred to as the IB-Graph,
for a given graphG, which aims to preserve the minimal necessary
information concerning the properties of Gwhile capturing the
maximal information about the label 𝑌. This approach compres-
sively identifies label-related information from the original graph
G, inspired by the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle
by optimizing the objective function as:
min
G𝑠𝑢𝑏−𝐼(𝑌;G𝑠𝑢𝑏)+𝛽𝐼(G;G𝑠𝑢𝑏), (3)
whereG𝑠𝑢𝑏is the IB-Graph and 𝑌is the label ofG. The first term
aims to maximize the mutual information between the graph label
and the subgraph to include as much graph label information 𝑌as
possible in the subgraph G𝑠𝑢𝑏. The second term aims to minimize
the mutual information between the original graph and the sub-
graph to include the original graph Gin the subgraphG𝑠𝑢𝑏to a
minimum extent.

We present our proposed method, called TGIB. We introduce GIB-
based objective for a temporal graph (Section 4.1), time-aware event

representation (Section 4.2), neural network parameterization for
each term of the objective function (Section 4.3 and 4.4) and spurious
correlation removal (Section 4.5). The entire process is presented
in Figure 2. We also include the pseudocode in Appendix D.
4.1 GIB-based Objective for Temporal Graph
We provide the objective of the Graph Information Bottleneck for
temporal graphs. TGIB extracts a bottleneck code R𝑘for the target
edge𝑒𝑘from its𝐿-hop neighborhood G𝑘. Specifically, the bottle-
neck codeR𝑘is a subgraph of 𝑒𝑘’s𝐿-hop computation graph. The
bottleneck mechanism on neighborhood information provides ex-
planations for the prediction of 𝑒𝑘. The objective function of the
graph information bottleneck is provided as follows:

𝑌𝑘;R𝑘

Section 4.4+𝛽𝐼
R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘
|           {z           }
Section 4.3. (4)
where𝑌𝑘is the label information regarding the occurrence of 𝑒𝑘.
The first term−𝐼
𝑌𝑘;R𝑘
allowsR𝑘to sufficiently learn label-
relevant information, while the second term 𝐼
R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘
ensures
thatR𝑘efficiently includes only important information related to
𝑒𝑘andG𝑘and removes unnecessary information. However, directly
optimizing Equation 4 is challenging because of the difficulty of
directly calculating the mutual information.
Inspired by [ 1], we obtain the upper bound of −𝐼

We model𝑞𝜃
𝑌𝑘|R𝑘
as a predictor which outputs predictions for
the occurrence of 𝑒𝑘based on the subgraph R𝑘. We can maximize
𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)by minimizingLclsusing the predictor.
Moreover, we obtain the upper bound of 𝐼
R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘

ibly applied to various distributions, including normal distributions.
We can minimize the upper bound of 𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)by minimizing
LMI.
Finally, we obtain the final loss function for the graph informa-
tion bottleneck as follows: L𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙=Lcls+𝛽LMI.4.2 Time-aware event representation
We generate time-aware event representations to capture the tem-
poral information of events. Inspired by [ 40], we obtain node rep-
resentations by performing self-attention based on temporal en-
coding. We consider the neighboring nodes for node 𝑧at time𝑡as
N(𝑧;𝑡)={𝑧1,𝑧2,···,𝑧𝑛}, where𝑛is the number of neighbors. The
interaction between 𝑧and one of its neighbor 𝑧𝑖has edge attribute
𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑧,𝑖∈R𝑓edgeand occurs at time 𝑡𝑧,𝑖, which is earlier than 𝑡. We use
the representations of neighbors, attributes of their interactions,
and their temporal information as the input to the self-attention
layer. We use ℎ(𝑙)
𝑧(𝑡)∈R𝑑to denote the representation of node 𝑧
at time𝑡in the𝑙-th layer, where ℎ(0)
𝑧(𝑡)is the raw node feature of
node𝑧, denoted as 𝑥𝑧∈R𝑓node, that is invariant over time 𝑡. For the
self-attention mechanism, we define the query, key and value as:
𝑄(𝑙)(𝑡)=h
ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑧(𝑡)∥𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑧,0∥Φ𝑑𝑇(0)i

𝐾(𝑙)(𝑡)=𝐾(𝑙)

ℎ(𝑙−1)
𝑧𝑛(𝑡𝑧,𝑛)∥𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑧,𝑛∥Φ𝑑𝑇(𝑡−𝑡𝑧,𝑛),(7)
where Φ𝑑𝑇:R→R𝑑𝑇is time encoding that provides a continuous
functional mapping from the time domain to the vector space with
𝑑𝑇dimensions. According to the translation-invariant assumption
of time encoding, we use
𝑡−𝑡𝑧,1,𝑡−𝑡𝑧,2,···,𝑡−𝑡𝑧,𝑛	as the in-
teraction times. This means that we only consider the time span
since time encoding is designed to measure the temporal distance
between nodes, which is more important than the absolute value
of time.
Each node collects information from its neighboring nodes, and
in this process, the attention weightsn

𝛼(𝑙)
𝑖(𝑡)indicates the contribution of node 𝑧𝑖to the features of node
𝑧within the topological structure N(𝑧;𝑡), considering the interac-
tion time𝑡with𝑧computed at layer 𝑙. We utilize self-attention to
incorporate temporal interactions into node features and structural
information. The representation for a node 𝑧𝑖within the neighbor-
hoodN(𝑧;𝑡)is calculated as 𝛼(𝑙)
𝑖(𝑡)·𝑉(𝑙)
𝑖(𝑡)based on the attention

We concatenate the neighborhood representation ˜ℎ(𝑙)

whereℎ(𝑙)
𝑧(𝑡)is the time-aware node embedding for node 𝑧at time

Finally, we construct the time-aware event representation for
the target event 𝑒𝑘={𝑢𝑘,𝑣𝑘,𝑡𝑘,att𝑘}with the representation of
the two nodes 𝑢𝑘and𝑣𝑘, time encoding and edge attribute att𝑘as
follows:
𝑋𝑒𝑘(𝑡𝑘)=
ℎ𝑢𝑘(𝑡𝑘)∥ℎ𝑣𝑘(𝑡𝑘)∥Φ𝑑𝑇(0)∥ att𝑘
, (11)
where𝑋𝑒𝑘(𝑡𝑘)denotes the time-aware representation for the target
event𝑒𝑘at time𝑡𝑘. Additionally, we define the candidate event
representation, denoted as 𝑍𝑒𝑗, which may potentially be included
within the explanation graph R𝑘as follows:
𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)=
ℎ𝑢𝑗(𝑡𝑗)∥ℎ𝑣𝑗(𝑡𝑗)∥Φ𝑑𝑇(𝑡𝑘−𝑡𝑗)∥att𝑗
, (12)
where all𝑒𝑗satisfy the following condition : 𝑒𝑗∈ G𝑘, where
1≤𝑗≤𝑘−1. In the time encoding Φ𝑑𝑇of the above equations, sim-
ilar to node representation, we consider the time span to measure
the temporal distance between each interaction. It allows time-
aware explanations to sufficiently incorporate temporal distance
information and ensures that the importance scores of multiple
events occurring between the same pair of nodes over time are
dependent on the time span. Therefore, we regard the interaction
time as𝑡𝑘−𝑡𝑗, where𝑡𝑘is the occurrence time of the target event
𝑒𝑘, and𝑡𝑗is the occurrence time of the candidate event 𝑒𝑗.4.3 Minimizing 𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)in Equation 6
In this section, we propose a parameterized time-aware bottleneck
to model𝑝(R𝑘|𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)given in Equation 6. To alleviate compu-
tational difficulty, we decompose (R𝑘|𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)into a multivariate
Bernoulli distribution as follows:
𝑝(R𝑘|𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)=Ö
𝑒𝑗∈R𝑘𝑝𝑘
𝑗·Ö
𝑒𝑗∈G𝑘\R𝑘(1−𝑝𝑘
𝑗), (13)
where𝑝𝑘
𝑗is the probability of 𝑒𝑗given𝑒𝑘andG𝑘, i.e.,𝑝(𝑒𝑗|𝑒𝑘,G𝑘),
following Bernoulli distribution. We apply the Gumbel-Softmax
technique [ 9] for sampling in order to allow gradients to propa-
gate from the classifier to the time-aware bottleneck module in
optimization. Each 𝑝𝑘
𝑗is computed as the output of an MLP that
takes the target event representation 𝑋𝑒𝑘and the candidate event
representation 𝑍𝑒𝑗as input as follows:
𝑝𝑘
𝑗=𝑝(𝑒𝑗|𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)=𝜎
𝑔
𝑋𝑒𝑘(𝑡𝑘), 𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)
(14)
where𝜎(·)is the sigmoid function and 𝑔is an MLP. A large 𝑝𝑘
𝑗
indicates that 𝑒𝑗is important for predicting 𝑒𝑘inG𝑘.
Next, we define the variational approximation 𝑞(R𝑘)of the mar-
ginal distribution 𝑝(R𝑘). For every edge 𝑒in the graphG𝑘, we
sample𝛼′𝑒∼𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛(𝑟), where𝑟∈[0,1]is a predefined hyperparam-
eter. We eliminate all edges in G𝑘and reinstate all edges with 𝛼′𝑒=1.
We assume that the graph obtained in this process is R𝑘. Conse-
quently, we use a multivariate Bernoulli distribution for 𝑞(R𝑘)as
follows :
𝑞(R𝑘)=𝑟|R𝑘|(1−𝑟)|G𝑘|−|R𝑘|. (15)
Finally, the mutual information loss LMIfor the time-aware
bottleneck in Equation 6 is calculated as follows:

4.4 Minimizing −𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)in Equation 5
The predictor 𝑞𝜃
𝑌𝑘|R𝑘
in Equation 5 provides predictions 𝑌𝑘
based on the bottleneck code R𝑘. We sample stochastic weights
from the Bernoulli distribution and obtain a valid event representa-
tion ˜𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)from the sampled 𝛼𝑘
𝑗as follows:
˜𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)=𝛼𝑘
𝑗𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘), 𝛼𝑘
𝑗∼𝐵𝑒𝑟(𝑝𝑘
𝑗), (17)
where𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)is the candidate event representation obtained from
Equation 12.
To ensure that gradients can be computed with respect to 𝑝𝑘
𝑗, we
use the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization trick [ 9]. We obtain the
representation ofR𝑘, denoted as 𝐻𝑘+, extracted from each ˜𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)
as follows:
𝐻𝑘
+=Readouthn
˜𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)|𝑒𝑗∈G𝑘oi
. (18)
Negative Sample. We utilize negative samples to effectively train
the predictor 𝑞𝜃
𝑌𝑘|R𝑘
. To generate a negative sample of 𝑒𝑘=
{𝑢𝑘,𝑣𝑘,𝑡𝑘,att𝑘}, we fix the node 𝑢𝑘and replace 𝑣𝑘by randomly
sampling a node from the entire graph G. We denote the randomly
sampled node as 𝑛𝑘, and the event representation 𝑋𝑒neg
𝑘(𝑡𝑘)corre-
sponding to the negative sample 𝑛𝑘is defined as follows:
𝑋𝑒neg
𝑘(𝑡𝑘)=
ℎ𝑢𝑘(𝑡𝑘)∥ℎ𝑛𝑘(𝑡𝑘)∥Φ𝑑𝑇(0)∥𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑘
(19)
In the same manner as 𝑋𝑒𝑘(𝑡𝑘), we extract the bottleneck code
based on𝑋𝑒neg
𝑘(𝑡𝑘)along with a candidate event 𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘), and sample
stochastic weights from the Bernoulli distribution. Consequently,
using the Bernoulli variables derived based on 𝑋𝑒neg
𝑘(𝑡𝑘), we select
important events from candidate events and obtain the selected
candidate graph embedding 𝐻𝑘−through a readout function.
Finally, we use the time-aware link prediction loss function as
follows:

where𝑞𝜃is an MLP,𝑁is the number of negative samples, and 𝑃𝑛
is a distribution from which negative samples are sampled.
Explanability. The explainability of TGIB is established by inject-
ing stochasticity into past candidate events. LMIin Equation 16
aims to assign high stochasticity to all candidate events, while Lcls
in Equation 20 simultaneously learns to reduce the stochasticity for
explanation graphs that are important for the occurrence of 𝑒𝑘. We
generate an importance score 𝑝𝑘
𝑗derived from the interactions of
events at different timestamps, i.e., 𝑒𝑘and𝑒𝑗, which allows the bot-
tleneck code to help generate a time-aware explanation. TGIB can
rank all candidate events according to 𝑝𝑘
𝑗and detect the top-ranked
candidate events as explanation graphs.4.5 Spurious Correlation Removal

Figure 3: Spurious Correlation Removal of TGIB.
TGIB eliminates spurious correlations within the input data and
ensures interpretability. If there is a correspondence between the
explanation of event occurrence R𝑘∗and the label Y, we can prove
thatR𝑘∗is the optimal solution for the objective function of TGIB
(i.e., Equation 4).
Proposition 1. Assume that eachG𝑘containsR𝑘∗, which deter-
mines𝑌𝑘. In other words, for some deterministic invertable func-
tion𝑓with randomness 𝜖that is independent of G𝑘, it satisfies
𝑌=𝑓(R𝑘∗)+𝜖. Then, for any 𝛽∈ [0,1], the optimalR𝑘that
minimizes−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)isR𝑘∗.
Proof. We can obtain the following derivation:
min
R𝑘−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)
=min
R𝑘−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)
=min
R𝑘−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘,R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)
=min
R𝑘−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘,R𝑘)+𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)
=min
R𝑘𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)
=min
R𝑘(1−𝛽)𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘),
where, sinceR𝑘is a subgraph ofG𝑘, implying(G𝑘,R𝑘)holds
no additional information over G𝑘, it follows−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘,R𝑘)=
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘)in the third equation and −𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘,R𝑘)=−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘)
in the fourth equation. The derivation of the equations is based
on the chain rule of mutual information, and since the objective
is to find theR𝑘that optimizes the equation, the terms that are
irrelevant toR𝑘have been removed (detailed derivation is provided
in Appendix A).
The above derivation shows that R𝑘that minimizes(1−𝛽)
𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)can also minimize−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)+
𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘). Since mutual information is always non-negative,
(1−𝛽)𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)reaches its minimum when
both𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)and𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)are equal to 0.
𝑌=𝑓(R𝑘∗)+𝜖, where𝜖is independent from G𝑘, implies that
𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘∗)=0. Similarly,R𝑘∗=𝑓−1(𝑌−𝜖)where𝜖is inde-
pendent fromG𝑘implies that 𝐼(R𝑘∗;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)=0. Therefore,
the following holds: (1−𝛽)𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘∗)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘∗;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)=
0. In other words, the optimal R𝑘that minimizes−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)+
𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)isR𝑘∗. □

Graph Information Bottleneck KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
As shown in the Figure 3, G𝑘and𝑌may have a spurious corre-
lation due to the factors excluding R𝑘∗fromG𝑘. In other words,
the correlation between G𝑘\R𝑘∗and the label 𝑌is a spurious
correlation and not a real factor in determining the label. Predicting
𝑌based onG𝑘has a risk of capturing spurious correlations, which
can lead to a decrease in the model’s generalization performance.
According to Proposition 1, this problem can be solved by optimiz-
ing the objective function of TGIB. It shows that event occurrence
can be predicted based on 𝑅𝑘∗without spurious correlations. As a
result, TGIB can improve the generalization performance of predic-
tions by removing spurious correlations for event occurrence.

mances of link prediction (Sec 5.2), explanation performances (Sec 5.3),

sure the performance of TGIB. The six datasets include various
applications and domains, such as social networks and communica-
tion networks. The following describes the details of the datasets
used for evaluation. Data statistics are provided in the Table 1.

•Wikipedia [11] consists of 9,227 nodes representing editors and
Wiki pages, and 157,474 edges representing timestamped post
requests. Each edge has a Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) feature vector of the requested text [ 20] with each vector
having a length of 172.
•UCI [18] is a social network within the online community of Uni-
versity of California, Irvine students spanning 196 days. Nodes
represent students, and edges denote messages exchanged be-
tween two students, each with a timestamp in seconds.
•USLegis [8] is a co-sponsorship network among U.S. senators.
Each node represents legislators, and two legislators are connected
if they have jointly sponsored a bill. The weight assigned to each
edge represents the number of times two legislators have jointly
sponsored bills over a period of 12 terms.
•CanParl [8] is a network capturing interactions among Canadian
Members of Parliament from 2006 to 2019. Nodes represent Mem-
bers of Parliament, and two members are connected if they both
vote in favor of a specific bill. The weight assigned to each edge
represents the number of times one member has voted in favor of
another member within one year.
•Enron [27] is an email network that includes communication
exchanged over a period of three years within the Enron energycompany. Nodes represent employees of the Enron company, and
edges represent the exchanged emails between two employees.
•Reddit [11] represents a network of posts created by users in
subreddits for one month. The nodes represent users and posts,
and the edges represent timestamped post requests. Similar to
Wikipedia, the features of the edges have LIWC feature vectors of
the requested text [20], with each vector having a length of 172.
Evalutation Protocol. We split the total time [0,𝑇]into[0,𝑇train],
[𝑇train,𝑇val], and[𝑇val,𝑇test]and use the events occurring within
each interval as the training set, validation set, and test set, respec-
tively. We set 𝑇train=0.7𝑇and𝑇val=0.85𝑇. We set the number of
layers to 2 and the dropout rate as 0.1 for the aggregation process
within the attention mechanism to obtain time-aware event repre-
sentations. Our model is trained for 10epochs using the Adam SGD
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00001. We set the dimensions
of the node embeddings and time encodings to be identical to the
raw features of the events. For the 𝐿-hop computational graph, we
set𝐿as 2. We evaluate the performance, which is averaged over 5
independent runs with different random seeds.
5.2 Link Prediction
Baselines. We use seven TGNN methods, i.e., Jodie [11],DyRep
[32],TGAT [40],TGN [24],TCL [36],CAW-N [37],GraphMixer
[3] as baselines. Details on compared baselines can be found in
Appendix E.
Setup. To measure performance in various settings, we assess link
prediction performance in both transductive and inductive settings.
•Transductive Setting. We use all events occurring in the three
intervals (i.e.,[0,𝑇train],[𝑇train,𝑇val], and[𝑇val,𝑇test]) as the train-
ing set, validation set, and test set, respectively. This means that
during the training time, all events occurring before 𝑇train can
be observed.
•Inductive Setting. We predict the occurrence of events involv-
ing nodes not observed during the training time. Specifically, 1)
we split the training set, validation set, and test set as shown
in Section 5.1. 2)We randomly select 10% of nodes from the
training set, and remove all events containing these nodes from
the training set. 3)We include the events involving these nodes
only in the validation and test sets.
Experiment Results. The experimental results for link prediction
in the transductive setting and inductive setting are presented in Ta-
ble 2 and Table 3, respectively. We measured the mean and standard
deviation of Average Precision (AP) on the test set. We obtained
the following observations: 1)TGIB demonstrated the highest per-
formance on 5 out of 6 datasets compared to the baselines for the
temporal graphs in both transductive and inductive settings. The
remaining dataset (i.e., Enron) showed the second-highest perfor-
mance compared to the baselines. We attribute the superior per-
formance of TGIB to its capturing of important past events, which
eliminates spurious correlations for an event occurrence 𝑒𝑘by pre-
dicting𝑌𝑘based onR𝑘as stated in Proposition 1. 2)TGIB achieved
high prediction performance in politics networks such as USLegis
and CanParl compared to the baselines. Specifically, in the inductive
setting, USLegis achieved a 47.4%performance improvement over

the runner-up baseline, and CanParl achieved a 42.3%improvement
over the runner-up baseline. These findings suggest that in a po-
litical network, specific individuals or groups can have significant
influence, and the GIB method effectively identifies these important
people or groups and analyzes their roles and influence. 3)Addi-
tionally, TGIB achieved very high AP scores of 99.28%and99.68%
in the Wikipedia and Reddit datasets, respectively. Even though
Wikipedia and Reddit already have high baseline performances,
with runner-up performances of 98.28%and98.30%respectively,
TGIB achieves nearly perfect performance on both datasets. TGIB
is the only model that demonstrates performance exceeding 99%
on both datasets.
5.3 Explanation Performance
Baselines. We use six explanation methods, i.e. Random, ATTN
[34],Grad-CAM [22],GNNExplainer [41],PGExplainer [16],
T-GNNExplainer [39] as baselines. Random is the explanation
results obtained by randomly sampling a number of nodes that
satisfy sparsity. Details on baselines are presented in Appendix E.
Setup. We used TGAT [ 40] as the base model for all baselines that
generate explanations in a post-hoc manner. Since the overall range
of Fidelity used as an evaluation metric in TGNNExplainer has vari-
ability depending on the dataset or base model, calculating the area
of the graph related to Fidelity may not provide consistent results.
Therefore, to evaluate the performance of explanations, we mea-
sure the proportion of predictions that match the model’s original
predictions when the model performs predictions based on expla-
nations. In other words, predictions based on superior explanations
have the same prediction label as predictions from the original
graph. We also evaluate the explanation performance over vari-
ous sparsity levels [ 39], where the sparsity is defined as |R𝑘|/|G𝑘|.
Since higher levels of sparsity would always yield better explana-
tion performance, we evaluate explanation performance in varioussparsity environments. We divide the sparsity level from 0 to 0.3
with intervals of 0.002, measure the performance of the explanation
graphR𝑘, and then calculate the area under the sparsity-accuracy
curve.
Experiment Results. We have presented the experimental results
for explanation performance in Table 4. We have the following ob-
servations: 1)TGIB outperforms all the baselines, indicating that it
provides a high quality of explanation for the predictions. 2)TGIB
achieved up to 27.5% improvement in performance on the UCI
dataset compared to the baselines. Moreover, 2 out of 5 baselines
(i.e., ATTN and Grad-CAM) show worse performance than random
explanations. 3)Some baselines, such as ATTN and Grad-CAM,
fail to provide explanation, performing even worse than random
explanations depending on the datasets, which significantly affect
the reliability of the explainable model. However, TGIB demon-
strates stable performance in explainablity, and its performance is
further supported by a theoretical background. Furthermore, we
present the inference time in Appendix C, demonstrating the effi-
ciency of our method’s evaluation while maintaining its superior
explanations.
5.4 Explanation Visualization
We compare the explanation visualizations for static graph expla-
nation models, GNNExplainer and PGExplainer, with the temporal
graph explanation model, TGIB, as shown in the Figure 4. In the
figure, the target events are depicted by red solid lines, and the
explanation events are depicted by blue solid lines. Additionally, we
marked the difference in occurrence timestamps between the target
event and each of the five explanation events. Then, the mean time
intervals are calculated as follows: (a) 1228523.4, (b) 1475006.2, and
(c) 612333.2. This shows that the time interval for (c) is smaller
than that for (a) and (b), and that the timestamps of the explanation
events in TGIB are closer to the timestamps of the target events

than those in GNNExplainer and PGExplainer. In temporal graphs,
events that occurred recently should have a greater influence on
the target event compared to events that happened a long time ago;
however, GNNExplainer and PGExplainer fail to capture this. In
other words, it shows that GNNExplainer and PGExplainer cannot
be easily generalized to temporal graphs because they don’t capture
temporal dynamics. In contrast, TGIB considers the temporal infor-
mation of the target event to generate explanations for temporal
graphs. Therefore, we can observe that TGIB is capable of capturing
temporal dependencies along with graph topology.

We conduct ablation studies to investigate the efficiency of the pro-
posed model (i.e., TGIB). Table 5 provides the ablation study of our
proposed method based on link prediction. The with all setting
indicates our final model including all components of TGIB. We
performed ablation studies on time-aware event representations
(i.e.,𝑋𝑒𝑘(𝑡𝑘)and𝑍𝑒𝑗(𝑡𝑘)) and losses relevant to mutual informa-
tion (i.e.,𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)and𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)). We obtain the following
observations: 1)Capturing temporal information from event repre-
sentations in the prediction based on the IB principle contributes
to performance improvement. 2)The model experiences declinesin performance when the terms relevant to mutual information,
𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)and𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘), are not considered. Specifically, the
removal of𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)results inR𝑘containing a large amount of
label-irrelevant information, leading to difficulties in the final label
prediction. Moreover, when 𝐼(G𝑘;𝑒𝑘,R𝑘)is not considered, it leads
to a decrease in the generalization performance of the prediction
due to the portions of G𝑘that have spurious correlations with 𝑌𝑘,
as mentioned in Section 4.5.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose TGIB, a more reliable and practical ex-
planation model for temporal graphs that can simultaneously per-
form prediction and explanation tasks. The main idea is to provide
time-aware explanations for the occurrence of the target events by
restricting the flow of information from candidate events to predic-
tions based on the IB theory. We demonstrate that TGIB exhibits
significant performance in both prediction and explanation across
various datasets, and its explanation visualizations show that it can
capture temporal relationships to extract important past events.
Consequently, TGIB represents a more adaptable explainable model
compared to existing models, capable of being efficiently trained
on dynamically evolving graph settings without the exhaustive
requirement for retraining from scratch, unlike other methods.

A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
In this section, we provide a detailed derivation process of equations
corresponding to part of the proof of Proposition 1.
From Equation 4, the TGIB objective is
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘). (21)
According to the chain rule of mutual information, we can decom-
pose the term 𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)as follows:
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘). (22)
Similarly, we decompose the term −𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|R𝑘)from Equa-
tion 22 as follows:
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘,R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘).
(23)
SinceR𝑘is a subgraph ofG𝑘,(G𝑘,R𝑘)holds no additional in-
formation overG𝑘. Therefore, Equation 23 can be expressed as
follows:
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘).
(24)
We also follow the same process for the term −𝐼(𝑌𝑘;R𝑘)as in
Equation 23 and 24, as follows:
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘,R𝑘)+𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘)
−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)
=−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘)+𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘)
−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘).
(25)
Additionally, we decompose the term 𝐼(𝑌𝑘,R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)according
to the chain rule of mutual information as:
−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘)+𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)
+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘).
(26)
We separate the terms related to R𝑘from those unrelated to R𝑘as
follows:
(1−𝛽)𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)−𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘)
+𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘)−𝛽𝐼(𝑌𝑘;𝑒𝑘|G𝑘).
(27)
We can substitute the terms unrelated to R𝑘with a constant 𝐶,
since they remain constant regardless of R𝑘as:
(1−𝛽)𝐼(𝑌𝑘;G𝑘|R𝑘)+𝛽𝐼(R𝑘;𝑒𝑘,G𝑘|𝑌𝑘)+𝐶. (28)
Therefore, we can utilize Equation 28 to find R𝑘that minimizes
Equation 21 .

In this section, we measure the inference time to produce an expla-
nation to investigate the effectiveness of TGIB. Table 7 shows the
inference time for several explanation models on Wikipedia and
Reddit datasets. All baselines are models that generate explanations
in a post-hoc manner, and TGAT is used as their base model. The
inference time is calculated for all test events. We obtain the fol-
lowing observations: 1)TGNNexplainer is time-consuming due to
its reliance on the MCTS algorithm. On the other hand, TGIB effi-
ciently detects important candidate events based on the IB principle
by injecting stochasticity into past candidate events to generate
explanations. 2)Some explanation models for static graphs have
fast inference times, but according to Table 4, they exhibit low-
quality explanations for temporal graphs. However, although TGIB
is slower than them, it does not demonstrate a significant time

difference with them and achieve notable explanation performance.
Therefore, considering both the quality of explanations and the
inference time, TGIB is regarded as a reasonable model.

E BASELINE DETAILS & SOURCE CODE
Details on compared baselines for each experiments are provided
below (Sec E.1, E.2). Official source codes for the baselines are also
provided in table 8.
E.1 Link Prediction
•Jodie [11] utilizes two coupled RNNs to produce temporal user
and item embeddings then projects temporal user embeddings
at a future time to predict the future user-item interaction.
•DyRep [32] is an RNN-based method that propagates messages
along the interaction, where messages are collected from neigh-
bors of nodes involved in the interaction.•TGAT [40] applies Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) to model
both spatial and temporal relationships concurrently by using
features with functional time encodings.
•TGN [24] uses both RNN-based model and SAM-based model
architecture, where the former is used to update node memory
for modeling temporal dependencies and the latter is used to
compute node embeddings modeling both spatial and temporal
information similar to TGAT.
•TCL [36] is a SAM-based method for modeling both spatial and
temporal dependencies, where contrastive objective function is
used to optimize encoders.
•CAW-N [37] utilizes Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs) ex-
tracted from temporal random walks to represent temporal
graph dynamics with anonymized node identities and the RNN
for encoding CAWs.
•GraphMixer [3] uses three modules, 1) MLP-based link encoder,
2) node encoder using neighbor mean-pooling and 3) MLP-based
link classifier without using commonly utilized RNN or SAM-
based architecture in temporal modeling.
E.2 Explanation Performance
•ATTN [34] utilizes learned attention weights of GAT as edge
importances to make explanations.
•Grad-CAM [22] provides post-hoc explanation for the GNN by
using importance score computed with gradients of the logit
value with respect to the node embeddings.
•GNNExplainer [41] is a post-hoc explanation model for provid-
ing explanations for GNN predictions. Specifically, this model
learns to mask the input graph while including label information
in the detected subgraphs.
•PGExplainer [16] uses parameterized edge distributions ob-
tained by explanation network to make explanation subgraph.
The explanation network is optimized by maximizing the mutual
information between the explanatory subgraph and predictions
of the GNN.
•T-GNNExplainer [39] aims to explain TGNNs post-hoc, em-
ploying both navigator and explorer components. The pretrained
navigator captures inductive relationships among events, and
the explorer seeks the optimal combination of candidates for
explanation.
