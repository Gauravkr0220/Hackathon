ABSTRACT
Accuracy and timeliness are indeed often conflicting goals in pre-
diction tasks. Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of
false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more infor-
mation can render them too late to be useful. In applications such
as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital
for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a
balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper,
we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on
Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement
an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based
on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary
challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2)
providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable
prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior
performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing
existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Spatio-temporal prediction, an innovative intersection of geographic
information systems, statistics, and data science, plays a pivotal
role in fields where spatial distribution and temporal progression
dictate outcomes. This predictive approach finds wide-ranging ap-
plications in domains such as meteorology, epidemiology, traffic
control, parking, and urban planning [15, 19, 27, 29, 33, 35].
Early spatio-temporal forecasting focuses on anticipating future
events by examining patterns that change over space and time as
early as possible, which is essential to many real-world applications
such as epidemiology, environmental studies, and public safety,
where early detection can lead to better management or prevention
outcomes. For instance, within the context of forecasting the spread
of diseases, the timeliness forecasting is considerably more critical
than their accuracy. Predictions that are accurate but delayed can
lead to the unnecessary loss of thousands of lives. On the other
hand, a prediction that is approximately accurate but made in a
timely manner can significantly reduce the impact, saving lives.
Figure 1 shows existing approaches to forecast spatio-temporal
events are categorised into three distinct strategies: Traditional,
Fixed, and Adaptive. For example, Hochreiter et al. [13] propose a
traditional method that considers the entire recorded data before
the forecasting. However, this approach can be time-consuming,
particularly with large datasets, and its requirement for complete
prior data collection often results in delays, which is unsuitable
for time-sensitive applications. Conversely, Li’s approach operates
within a set observation period [ 20], facilitating fixed timely fore-
casts within a specific window. Although this strategy enhances
promptness, its fixed timing can result in inaccuracies if the ob-
servation window is not optimally selected. Moreover, its rigidity

Figure 1: Example of three methods for early spatio-temporal
forecasting. Each circle is a node (e.g. sensor) with recorded
value (such as speed) over time. The blue plane represents the
prediction time, and the recorded values after the blue plane

prediction time for different nodes. The node colour at time

in adjusting to temporal data variations and the risk of selection
bias in determining the observation window could compromise its
precision. The third approach, named adaptive early forecasting,
dynamically adjusts the forecasting time based on data character-
istics. This idea is inspired by Hartvigsen, who applied this idea
in the time-series prediction area [ 11]. This innovative method
aims to strike an optimal balance between forecasting accuracy and
timeliness, thereby attempting to optimise both the timeliness and
accuracy. Its dynamic adaptability provides a significant edge in
handling changes over time.
Although Hartivigsen has tried to apply the concept of early
prediction in time-series area [ 11] and achieved some good results
in the medical diagnosis, many challenges remain, especially in
the spatio-temporal forecasting. (1) Real-time Bi-objective Bal-
ance in Highly Complex Environment: Spatio-temporal data
demand dynamic solutions, being more complex and subject to
rapid changes than time-series data. Traditional multi-objective
optimisation methods, which are static and computationally in-
tensive, fail to adapt efficiently across different environments. At
the same time, early forecasting necessitates immediate results, as
even a one-minute delay can lead to unfavourable outcomes. (2)
Spatio-temporal Comprehensive Dependency: Relying solely
on distance correlation for spatio-temporal forecasting may fall
short in quickly capturing essential data characteristics. Although
distance correlation effectively reflects spatial connections among
nodes, it overlooks the crucial temporal aspects embedded withinthe data, which are vital for precise forecasting. (3) Hidden Pref-
erences Discovery: The equilibrium between timeliness and accu-
racy varies across tasks, revealing diverse preferences. Identifying
these subtle preferences is a complex challenge that demands a
profound comprehension of the goals at hand and formulating an
ideal balance between promptness and precision for each scenario.
This highlights the necessity for refined and flexible strategies in
early spatio-temporal forecasting.
We address the aforementioned challenges by introducing a
early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on multi-objective
reinforcement learning (STEMO). The key contributions of our
study can be summarised as follows:
•We present a multi-objective reinforcement learning frame-
work designed to optimise both the timeliness and accu-
racy of spatio-temporal forecasting. This approach enhances
adaptability to changing patterns through interactive learn-
ing from real-time feedback.
•We introduce a multiple-step similarity matrix, enabling each
node to capture the trends from other upstream nodes so
that we can estimate the changes of such nodes earlier.
•We develop a node embedding technique based on biased
random walks, increasing the likelihood of visiting nodes
with higher similarity and reaching the optimal time. To
address the issue of non-uniform object scales or units, we
devise a method to discover hidden preferences and employ
the entropy weight method.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Spatio-temporal Prediction
It is evident that spatio-temporal prediction is of paramount impor-
tance in numerous real-world applications [ 31], such as weather
prediction [ 2], traffic flow prediction [ 6], and earthquake predic-
tion [ 37]. Traditional time-series methods, including ARIMA [ 1],
have been extensively employed for prediction. With the evolution
of machine learning, deep learning methods such as Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) [ 13] and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) [ 3] have
demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing temporal correla-
tions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [ 18] are frequently
utilised to capture spatial correlations in Euclidean space, whereas
Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) [ 17] serve to model non-
Euclidean relationships among nodes. Despite these advancements,
fixed observation windows limit the ability of these models to ad-
just their predictions in response to evolving data patterns, which
could compromise their timeliness and accuracy, especially when
dealing with rapidly changing data sources like traffic flow.
2.2 Early Prediction
Early prediction methods are techniques employed to make pre-
dictions based on specific identifiable characteristics or temporal
patterns within a dataset. These methods can be classified into two
categories: shapelet-based methods and predictor-based methods.
Shapelet-based methods [ 7,12] involve finding small sub-parts of
the time series data, known as shapelets [ 36], that can be utilised
for prediction. Predictor-based methods [ 8,22,23,28] involve com-
bining a set of predictors built at different points in time with one
or more conditions or trigger functions to evaluate the reliability of

predictions and help determine whether they should be considered
or discarded. Most of these methods prioritise accuracy over time-
liness, inadvertently downplaying the role of prompt predictions.
Some methods [ 22,23,30] allow for adjusting the trade-off between
accuracy and timeliness with parameters, but these parameters can
be difficult to adjust in advance and may require executing the al-
gorithm multiple times to obtain solutions with different trade-offs.
In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Early Prediction model
that seeks to improve both the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-
temporal predictions, addressing some of the limitations inherent
in existing techniques.
3 PROBLEM DEFINITION
Consider a graphG={V,E}, where V={𝑣𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1denotes the set
of nodes and E={𝑒𝑖𝑗}𝑛
𝑖,𝑗=1represents the set of edges. The adja-
cency matrix A∈R𝑛×𝑛captures the relationships (e.g., distance)
between nodes. Recorded values X𝑡={𝑥𝑖
𝑡}𝑛
𝑖=1refer to the mea-
surements obtained from the nodes at time 𝑡. forecasted values
bX𝑇={ˆ𝑥𝑖
𝑇}𝑛
𝑖=1are the estimates of the values at time 𝑇based on
the graph neural network model. For instance, in a traffic speed
forecasting scenario, 𝑥𝑖
𝑡could be the speed at sensor 𝑣𝑖at time𝑡, and
ˆ𝑥𝑖
𝑇could be the forecasted speed at time 𝑇. The optimal time series
t∗={𝑡∗
𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1can guide the data observation process. For each node
𝑣𝑖, the corresponding optimal time 𝑡∗
𝑖is the most appropriate that
the forecasting accuracy is maximised and the time cost minimises.
We aim to find the optimal time series that balances forecasting
accuracy and time cost. The optimal time for node 𝑣𝑖is computed
using the following expression:
𝑡∗
𝑖=arg max
𝑡
log𝑃
ˆ𝑥𝑖
𝑇|X0:𝑡,G
−Cost(𝑡)
.
s.t.𝑡∈[0,𝑇−1](1)
The objective function log𝑃(ˆ𝑥𝑖
𝑇|X0:𝑡,G)denotes the log-likelihood
of the forecasted value given the past measurements and the graph
structure, which can be seen as a measure of the accuracy. The
function Cost(𝑡)represents the time cost of collecting records up
to time𝑡, and it is assumed to be monotonically increasing as more
data is often more expensive to obtain.
4 METHODOLOGY
As shown in Figure 2, the Early Spatio-Temporal Forecasting model
based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning (STEMO) consists
of three main components: a spatio-temporal predictor, a state
generator, and optimal policies for determining the optimal time.
In addition, we also introduce how to find hidden preferences.
4.1 The Spatio-temporal Predictor
The main difference between traditional GCN and the Multi-Graph
Convolutional Neural network (MGCN) is the addition of multiple
time steps in the similarity matrix calculation in the latter. A stan-
dard GCN calculates similarity based on spatial proximity or a single
time-point temporal similarity, leading to a limitation in capturing
time-evolving trends. MGCN improves this by including multiple
time-step similarities, capturing more intricate time-evolving cor-
relations, and facilitating timeliness.

values is necessary, while ’Halt’ implies that time 𝑡is the

time, and we only need to observe the solid line to make
forecasting. The two solid dots in Figure (a) correspond to
the two red circles in Figure (b). Take the red circle below
as an example, it corresponds to the DTW distance between
𝑥𝑖
0:𝑡and𝑥𝑗
0:𝑡, which is calculated along the green grid path.
We anticipate that node 𝑖will acquire feature 𝑥𝑗
𝑡∗
𝑗at time𝑡
through MGCN, allowing it to make more precise forecasting
earlier.
Specifically, GCN collects equal-length time series of each node,
applies the DTW algorithm to each pair of time series data, and uses
dynamic time warping (DTW) distance [ 24] to create a similarity
matrix. DTW is a method that finds an optimal match between two
given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions, which
is particularly useful in our setting where we seek to find corre-
lations in temporal data. However, GCN has certain limitations.

Figure 4: We assume node 1 (red) is the central node. The blue
nodes represent spatially close nodes, while the green nodes
represent temporally similar nodes. MGCN considers these
two kinds of nodes, where spatial and temporal similarities
are processed separately but in conjunction.
One limitation is that it does not consider the influence of other
nodes before time 𝑡. As shown in Figure 3, 𝑡represents a specific
time, and𝑡′is an arbitrary time. If 𝑡′<𝑡andDTW(𝑥𝑗
0:𝑡′,𝑥𝑖
𝑡)=0,
this may result from node 𝑣𝑗changing faster than the node 𝑣𝑖. In
such cases, it would be advantageous for node 𝑣𝑖to incorporate
the feature of node 𝑣𝑗at time𝑡′, this would enable it to capture the
changing trend better and facilitate early forecasting. Moreover, if
𝑡′=𝑡∗
𝑗<𝑡, this would also allow node 𝑖to reach the optimal time
more quickly. Another limitation of this approach is that it may pro-
duce inaccurate results when DTW(𝑥𝑗
𝑡∗
𝑗,𝑥𝑖
𝑡∗
𝑗)>0, indicating a weak
correlation between nodes 𝑣𝑗and𝑣𝑖. This may not always be true
and could lead to sub-optimal outcome. The MGCN addresses these
limitations, which is designed to optimize both forecasting accu-
racy and timeliness. As depicted in Figure 4, the multiple timesteps
similarity matrix allows the model to capture correlations better,
thus achieving more accurate outcome. In addition, MGCN can
incorporate the fast-changing trends from other nodes to make
forecasting earlier.

The encoder-decoder structure is utilized for its capacity to cap-
ture temporal dependencies and handle variable length sequences,
as shown in Figure 2. In contrast to previous work, the variation
in the number of units (consisting of an MGCN and a GRU) allows
the model to dynamically adjust its focus to different parts of the
time sequence. At time 𝑡, the encoder has 𝑡+1units. The recorded
values X𝑡are input into MGCN in the unit 𝑡+1, and the result of
graph convolution process X′
𝑡is then used as input for the GRU.
Combining the hidden state H𝑡−1of GRU output in the previous
unit, the GRU outputs hidden state H𝑡. In practice, in the encoder,
only the last prediction unit at each time needs to be calculated. At
time𝑡, the decoder has 𝑇−𝑡−1units, and the last unit outputs the

4.2 State Generator
The relationship between nodes is based on temporal similarity
and spatial similarity. In essence, if 𝑥𝑖
𝑡∗
𝑖and𝑥𝑗
𝑡show similarity, it
suggests a possible temporal connection between node 𝑖and𝑗.
We propose to leverage this connection to help node 𝑗reach its
optimal time more quickly by learning from node 𝑖. We designed
an embedding function 𝑓𝑡(·)for each time 𝑡, which operates on
the features of the node and aims to create a representation of
each node at time 𝑡. The state𝑠𝑖
𝑡captures the current information
status of node 𝑖at time𝑡. It combines the hidden state H𝑖
𝑡∈Rℎ
outputted by the encoder and the node embedding 𝑓𝑡(𝑣𝑖)∈R𝑒. The
state is used to verify the optimal time by providing comprehensive
information for each node at each time.
The choice of objective function stems from the assumption
that a node’s state is influenced by its neighbours’ states, and the
optimisation goal is to maximise the probability of the appearance
of the node’s neighbours given the node itself:
max
𝑓𝑡∑︁
𝑣𝑖∈Vlog𝑃𝑟(𝑁(𝑣𝑖)|𝑓𝑡(𝑣𝑖)), (5)
where𝑁(𝑣𝑖)represents the set of neighbors of 𝑣𝑖obtained by biased
random walk sampling [9, 25].
 
2621STEMO: Early Spatio-temporal Forecasting with Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
Biased random walk sampling is used to select a node’s neigh-
bours that contribute to its state. The bias term 𝛼𝑝𝑞(𝑡)and the transi-
tion probability min𝑡′AT
𝑡,𝑡′control the sampling process, favouring
nodes that are closer (in terms of reaching their optimal time) and
thus more relevant to the early forecasting task. Given the source
node𝑣𝑖and the current node 𝑣𝑗, the probability of accessing the
next node𝑣𝑘is represented by the bias term 𝛼𝑝𝑞(𝑡)multiplied by
the transition probability min
𝑡′AT
𝑡,𝑡′, where𝛼represent bias, and is
calculated as follows:
𝛼𝑝𝑞(𝑡)= 
1
𝑝if𝑣𝑘=𝑣𝑖
1
𝑞if𝑡∗
𝑘≤𝑡
1else, (6)
where𝑝controls the probability of revisiting the traversed node,
and𝑞controls the search program to distinguish whether the node
reaches the optimal time or not. After the random walk sampling,
the remaining steps are the same as in the DeepWalk [ 26] algorithm,
using the word2vec [ 4] method to learn the embedding function
𝑓𝑡(·). In essence, nodes are treated as ’words’ and node sequences
sampled from random walks are treated as ’sentences’. By feeding
these sequences into a word2vec model, we can learn an embedding
for each node that captures its context within the graph, i.e., its
neighbourhood structure.
4.3 Finding the Optimal Set of Policies
Since our goal is to induce a single model that can adapt to the
entire space of preferences Ω(a set of different ways decision-
makers can prioritise or value the various objectives involved in
an optimisation problem), we use a neural network to represent
the Q-valuesQ⊆( Ω→R2)S×Awith state spaceSand action
spaceA. The input to this neural network is a concatenation of
the states, actions, and user preferences. At time 𝑡, the network
takes the states s𝑡and preferences 𝝎∈Ωas input. We estimate
the actions a𝑡that maximise the output of the network and verify
a series of optimal times according to the actions.
We use𝜀-greedy action selection to avoid abundant exploitation
as follows:
a𝑡=(
max a𝝎𝑇Q(s𝑡,a,𝝎;𝜃),w.p. 1−𝜀
random, w.p.𝜀, (7)
where𝜃indeed refers to the parameters of the Q-network, which
are updated during training, action a𝑡={𝑎𝑖
𝑡}𝑛
𝑖=1is replaced by a
random action with probability 𝜀, and𝜀decreases exponentially
from 1 to 0 during training. For node 𝑣𝑖,𝑎𝑖
𝑡=1indicates that 𝑡is
the optimal time 𝑡∗

𝑡=0,𝑡∈[0,𝑇−1], time𝑇−1is the optimal
time.
We designed reward r𝑡={𝑟𝑖
𝑡,acc,𝑟𝑖
𝑡,time}𝑛
𝑖=1includes accuracy
reward and temporal reward. The accuracy reward reflects how
well the current prediction and action align with the ground truth,
while the temporal reward encourages faster convergence to the
optimal time by penalising longer observation time. The specific
calculation is as follows:
𝑟𝑖
𝑡,acc=−|b𝑥𝑖
𝑇−𝑥𝑖
𝑇|, 𝑟𝑖
𝑡,time=−𝜌𝑡, (8)
where𝜌is the trade-off parameter.To train the deep neural network, we minimise the following
loss function at each step 𝑘:
𝐿𝐴(𝜃)=Es𝑡,a𝑡,𝝎
||y−Q(s𝑡,a𝑡,𝝎;𝜃)||2
2
y=r𝑡+𝛾arg𝑄max
a,𝝎′𝝎𝑇Q(s𝑡+1,a,𝝎′;𝜃𝑘). (9)
Thearg max operation is used to select the action and preference
that maximise the future expected total rewards. However, the
optimal frontier contains a large number of discrete policies, which
makes the landscape of the loss function non-smooth. To address
this problem, we use an auxiliary loss function:
𝐿𝐵(𝜃)=Es𝑡,a𝑡,𝝎h
|𝝎𝑇y−𝝎𝑇Q(s𝑡,a𝑡,𝝎;𝜃)|i
, (10)
The final loss function is 𝐿(𝜃)=(1−𝜆)𝐿𝐴(𝜃)+𝜆𝐿𝐵(𝜃), where
𝜆is the weight that controls the trade off 𝐿𝐴and𝐿𝐵. The value of
𝜆is increased gradually from 0 to 1 during training.

4.4 Finding the Hidden Preference
Inspired by [ 34], we employ the hidden preference 𝝎, which can
greatly influence the policy’s decisions. In the domain of Multi-
Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), the concept of hidden
 
2622KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Wei Shao, et al.
preferences refers to the underlying, often undisclosed preferences
that influence the prioritisation and weighting of multiple compet-
ing objectives within a decision-making process. These preferences
are deemed ’hidden’ as they are not explicitly known a priori and
must be inferred from the interactions within the environment. The
elucidation of these preferences is pivotal for adapting and opti-
mising policies across diverse tasks where the relative importance
of objectives is not directly observable. This necessity arises from
the inherent complexity and variability of real-world scenarios,
where explicit preference delineation is impractical, thus requir-
ing algorithms capable of discerning and adapting to these latent
preferences effectively.
We search the hidden preferences with five steps, (1) The algo-
rithm learns a single parametric policy network that is optimised
over the entire space of preferences. This is significant because it
allows the system to adapt its policy based on any given prefer-
ence set, without needing to learn a new policy from scratch. (2)
Employing a generalised version of the Bellman equation, which
incorporates preferences into the decision-making process. This
adaptation enables the system to handle multiple objectives by ad-
justing the policy according to a set of linear preferences, which
can represent the relative importance of each objective. (3) The
algorithm uses hindsight experience replay to learn from past deci-
sions. (4) When provided with just scalar rewards and unknown
preferences, the algorithm utilises a combination of policy gradient
methods and stochastic search over the preference parameters. This
approach helps in estimating the hidden preferences that would
maximise the expected return, given the observed outcomes.
5 EXPERIMENT
In this section, we mainly introduce the datasets, baselines and spe-
cific parameter settings, etc. Experiments were conducted around
comparing the predicted performance of the Early Spatio-Temporal
Forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning
(STEMO) against baselines, analyzing the effect of each module,
and finding the hidden preference.

5.1.1 Datasets. We conduct experiments on three real-world large-
scale datasets: METR-LA [14] The dataset used in this study is
a collection of public transportation speed data from 207 sensors
on the Los Angeles Expressway. The data was collected using ring

Detailed statistics of the datasets are shown in Table 1. For NYPD,
we take the centroid of the crime site in the area as the location
coordinates of the area. For METR-LA, NYPD and EMS, 70% of
the data are used for training, 20% for testing, and the rest 10% for
verification. The proposed model is executed on a Windows system
with Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070Ti.
5.1.2 Parameters Settings. For our proposed model, we selected
parameters based on preliminary experiments and prior research.
Specifically, we adopted the Adam optimiser [ 16] with an initial
learning rate of 0.001, which proved to offer a stable and efficient
convergence in our preliminary experiments. We set the hidden
state dimension ℎto 12 as it provided a good balance between
computational complexity and model performance. Similarly, the
batch size is set to 32. The number of preferences 𝑁𝜔=16, the node
embedding dimension 𝑒=4, the parameter 𝜅=0.005. In addition,
𝑝=2,𝑞=0.5,𝜌=0.5, and𝑇=12are all inspired by prior work. The
source code is available at https://github.com/coco0106/MO-STEP.
5.1.3 Baselines and Metrics. We compare STEMO with various
baselines for spatio-temporal prediction tasks and early prediction
tasks, including HA[21],LSTM [13],DCRNN [20],ASTGCN [10],
EARLIEST [11], Graph-WaveNet [32].
5.1.4 Metrics. We use three popular prediction indicators to eval-
uate the performance of all models, including mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percent-
age error (MAPE), which are commonly used measures in regression
tasks to evaluate the average magnitude of prediction errors.
In addition, we computed the hypervolume (HV) [ 38] and the
spacing (S) [ 5] metrics, which are commonly used to evaluate the
performance of multi-objective optimization algorithms. The HV
metric measures the volume of the space dominated by the Pareto
front found by the algorithm up to a reference point. A higher HV
value means that the algorithm has found a set of solutions that
dominate a larger part of the target space, which is usually better. S
metric measures the distance between adjacent solutions in Pareto
frontier. A lower S value is usually better, because it shows that the
solutions are more evenly distributed and provide decision makers
with a wider range of trade-off options.

5.2 Experiment Results
We evaluate the performance of STEMO against the chosen base-
line models in terms of the aforementioned metrics. The impact ofeach module is quantified through an ablation study, where we se-
quentially remove one module at a time and measure the change in
overall performance. In addition, we also reveal hidden preferences.

average used time percentage by adjusting the preference, where
the average usage time percentage, defined as the sum of the opti-
mal time instances 𝑡∗

𝑇and multiplied by 100%, represents the proportion of optimal time
in the total time. This approach allows us to explore different predic-
tion timeliness and assess the corresponding prediction accuracy,
where the accuracy is measured by the error between the ground

truth and the predicted values obtained by each node at their opti-
mal time. We observe that: (1)When considering the same average
used time percentage, the STEMO model exhibits higher accuracy
compared to LSTM, DCRNN, ASTGCN, and Graph-WaveNet. The
accuracy of the STEMO model shows a lesser decrease when the
average usage time percentage experiences an equivalent reduc-
tion. This suggests that the STEMO model, which determines the
optimal time based on the network’s dynamics, can adapt to di-
verse scenarios, striking a balance between timeliness and accuracy
in forecasting. In contrast, the fixed optimal time used by LSTM,
DCRNN, ASTGCN, and Graph-WaveNet might not adequately ac-
count for the dynamic nature of various scenarios. (2)When the
average used time percentage is the same, the STEMO model out-
performs EARLIEST in terms of accuracy. This improvement can
be attributed to the STEMO model’s consideration of spatial and
temporal characteristics, especially in scenarios like the METR-
LA dataset, where the nodes are densely distributed and exhibit
strong correlations. The STEMO model leverages a Multi-Graph
Convolutional Neural network (MGCN) that incorporates multi-
ple time-steps similarity matrices and the distance matrix. This
framework effectively captures and utilises the spatio-temporal cor-
relations among the nodes. Additionally, our experiments revealed
that ASTGCN exhibits poor performance on the NYPD dataset. This
outcome could be attributed to missing values within the dataset
and the limited representation ability of the model.
As depicted in Table 3, above-average HV and lower S metrics
for the STEMO model indicate its effectiveness in managing a trade-
off between accuracy and timeliness in predictions - our primary
objectives in this study. A higher HV, as observed in the STEMO
model, signifies not only better convergence, illustrating the prox-
imity of the solution set to the real Pareto frontier, but also greater
extensiveness, indicating a broad coverage of the solution set in the
objective space. Additionally, it implies better uniformity, showing
an even distribution of individual solutions in the set. This high HV
value affirms our assumption that the STEMO model can effectively
balance prediction accuracy while maintaining the timeliness of
predictions and offer a wide array of diverse solutions. On the other
hand, the S metric provides a measure of the dispersion or spread of
the solutions in the objective space. A lower S, as displayed by the
STEMO model, suggests that the solutions are evenly distributed.
This means that the STEMO model offers a variety of optimal times
for forecasting, and provides a robust and versatile model for vari-
ous scenarios. This aligns well with our goal of creating a model
that can cater to diverse situations with reliable results across a
range of forecasting times.5.2.2 Ablation Study. To assess the contribution of individual com-
ponents within our proposed STEMO model, we conducted an
ablation study using the NYPD dataset, the results of which are pre-
sented in Table 4. In the ablation study, we evaluated the following
variants of the STEMO model: w/o similarity matrix (without sim-
ilarity matrix), w/o node embedding (without node embedding),
w/o policy (without policy only use fixed value).
As seen from Table 4, the full STEMO model consistently outper-
forms all variants across different average used time percentages
in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. For instance, when the simi-
larity matrix is removed (’w/o similarity matrix’), the performance
degrades, especially at lower average used time percentages. This
suggests the importance of the similarity matrix in capturing spatio-
temporal information to maintain the model’s performance even at
lower time percentages. The removal of the node embedding (’w/o
node embedding’) and the policy network (’w/o policy’) also leads
to a decrease in performance. This emphasises the significance
of the node embedding in capturing the spatial dependencies and
the policy network in adaptively determining the optimal time for
predictions. Overall, these findings underline the importance of
each component and how they collectively contribute to the robust
performance of the STEMO model in balancing prediction accuracy
and timeliness.
5.2.3 Revealing hidden preferences. We modified the parameter 𝜌
to provide vectorised rewards for encoding two different objects:
timeliness and accuracy. We used two different tasks (g1, g2) and
used only 100 episodes to learn the hidden preferences. The derived
hidden preferences are depicted in Table 5. The learned preferences
of the model are concentrated on the diagonal, indicating that
they are in good agreement with the actual potential preferences.
For variant g1, the model shows a strong preference (0.67) for
timeliness. This result is consistent with the primary goal of g1,
which emphasizes making predictions as quickly as possible. g2
primarily focuses on accuracy, as evidenced by the significantly
higher preference weight (0.97) for accuracy.

6 DISCUSSION
Although the STEMO model shows promise in handling early spatio-
temporal forecasting tasks, several areas merit further exploration.
First, the model’s performance might be restricted if it was primar-
ily validated on a limited set of real-world datasets, which brings
into question its generalizability to different scenarios or data types.
Future studies could benefit from testing the model on a more
diverse datasets from varying domains. Second, the model’s com-
plexity might pose challenges in interpretation and computational
efficiency. Third, future work should aim to simplify the model or
increase its interpretability without sacrificing performance. Ad-
ditionally, the model’s ability to learn hidden preferences requires
deeper investigation.
7 CONCLUSION
We propose the Early Spatio-Temporal Forecasting model based on
Multi-Objective reinforcement learning (STEMO) model, specifi-
cally designed to address challenges in early spatio-temporal fore-
casting. The STEMO model leverages the Multi-Graph Convolu-
tional Neural network (MGCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
to capture and analyze spatio-temporal correlations. Further, it uti-
lizes the hidden state from the encoder’s output in conjunction
with node embeddings to adaptively determine the optimal time
for forecasting. Additionally, we also explore hidden preferences
within our model. Future work will focus on further refining our
model, exploring its application in other domains, and addressing
any limitations encountered in this study. We believe that our re-
search contributes significantly to the ongoing discourse in the
field of spatio-temporal forecasting and will serve as a foundation
for future advancements.
