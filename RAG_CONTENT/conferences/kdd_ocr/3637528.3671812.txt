Abstract
Conventional machine learning typically assume a fixed learning
objective throughout the learning process. However, for real-world
tasks in open and dynamic environments, objectives can change
frequently. For example, in autonomous driving, a car has several
default modes, but a user’s concern for speed and fuel consumption
varies depending on road conditions and personal needs. We for-
mulate this problem as learning with varied objectives (LVO), where
the goal is to optimize a dynamic weighted combination of multiple
sub-objectives by sequentially selecting actions that incur different
losses on these sub-objectives. We propose the VaRons algorithm,
which estimates the action-wise performance on each sub-objective
and adaptively selects decisions according to the dynamic require-
ments on different sub-objectives. Further, we extend our approach
to cases involving contextual representations and propose the Con-
VaRons algorithm, assuming parameterized linear structure that
links contextual features to the main objective. Both the VaRons and
ConVaRons are provably minimax optimal with respect to the time
horizon𝑇, with ConVaRons showing better dependency with the
number of sub-objectives 𝐾. Experiments on dynamic classifier and
real-world cluster service allocation tasks validate the effectiveness
of our methods and support our theoretical findings.

Conventional machine learning workflows typically have a pre-
defined and fixed learning objective throughout the learning pro-
cess, such as maximizing accuracy. However, the learning objectives
in real-world applications could vary continuously due to changes
in the specific task at hand. Considering model updating in au-
tonomous driving, the main objective could be a dynamic com-
bination of several sub-objectives, such as increasing speed and
improving energy efficiency according to specific vehicle states,
such as fuel level, road, and weather conditions. Meanwhile, clas-
sifiers trained for a fixed objective may be less effective when the
objective change happens. It is important to formalize this problem
and design corresponding machine learning algorithms with the
ability to adapt to the arbitrarily changing learning objectives in
the open-environment machine learning [45].
In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning with vary-
ing objectives, where the main objective can be represented by a
dynamic combination of several sub-objectives. Consider the illus-
tration in Figure 1: for the autonomous driving system, one can
switch to “high-performance mode” when the main objective is
driving performance and to “power saving mode” when the main
objective changes to endurance. In practice, however, the user usu-
ally needs both performance and endurance; the main objective
is neither but a weighted combination of the two. Meanwhile, the
weights could vary over time according to the user’s needs. In this
case, the best choice may not be either modes but other customized
modes. Nevertheless, it is also hardly impossible to define a default
mode for each combination. Therefore, it is desirable not only to be
able to learn about other custom modes but also to be able to make
decisions about which modes to select according to the knowledge
learned and specific requirements that may be constantly changing.
Some works consider similar problems by optimizing multi-
ple sub-objectives simultaneously, such as multi-objective multi-
armed bandits (MO-MAB) [ 11,26] and multi-objective optimization
(MOO) [ 13,23]. MOMAB assumes the main objective is a static,
predefined weighted combination of sub-objectives, which does
not consider a dynamic setting where the weights can vary over
time. Thus, MO-MAB approaches are unsuitable for handling varied
objectives with time-varying weights.
On the other hand, the goal of MOO approaches is to identify
the Pareto front, which is the set of modes where no other modes
can outperform across all sub-objectives. However, as we usually
have a specific main objective at each time, the best choice in most

cases is unique. In this case, as the Pareto front contains all Pareto
optimal modes rather than a single best choice, decisions made
according to the Pareto front may not always achieve the best
performance [ 35,43]. We illustrate this by the example in Figure 1,
where we focus on the third scenario where the two sub-objectives
are equally weighted. In this case, modes 1and2, though both being
Pareto optimal, are not the best choice compared to the customized
mode𝑖. In this case, the Pareto front found by MOO approaches may
be sub-optimal due to the inability to select a single best choice.
Considering these limitations in dealing with a specific yet arbi-
trarily varied objective, we try to take a step towards bridging this
gap by trying to answer the following question:
Can we develop a decision-making strategy that consistently guar-
antees the selection of a single, optimal choice, one that is adaptive to
an arbitrarily varied objective?
In this paper, we formalize the problem discussed above as
learning with varied objectives (LVO) within an online decision-
making framework and provide a positive answer to the above
question. Specifically, we follow the basic assumption in the works
of Drugan and Nowé [11], Murata et al. [26] that the main objec-
tive can be represented by the weighted combination of several
sub-objectives. Still, we additionally assume that the weights can
becontinuously changing, representing changing emphasis on dif-
ferent sub-objectives. We formulate this problem by the following
decision-making process: the learner first defines several modes
that can possibly handle sub-objectives, and we refer to these modes
as the action set of the decision-making procedure if no further
confusion arises. At each time, after receiving the main objective
defined by the explicitly known weights, the learner chooses a
single action from the action set. By choosing the action, feedback
indicating whether this choice is good or not is returned, enabling
the learner to update for better future selections. The goal is to
maximize the performance (or, equivalently, minimize the loss) on
the main objective by such decision-making procedure. A brief
comparison between LVO, MOMAB, and MOO is given in Table 1.
Based on our formulation of the LVO problem, we propose the
varied-objective online Newton step(VaRons) algorithm for LVO.Table 1: Comparisons between LVO, MO-MAB and MOO.

In particular, since the main objective (the weights of each sub-
objective) could change over time, the loss distribution on the main
objective can be time-varying even for the same action, making it
difficult to estimate the main objective accurately. Alternatively,
we avoid directly estimating the main objective and turn to esti-
mating the action-wise performance of each sub-objective, based
on which we then utilize the weighted combination structure to
recover the estimation of the main objective. According to this
estimation, we then construct an estimated loss distribution over
all actions, from which we employ a randomized sampling strategy
to select an action. After such a choice, feedback representing loss
on the main objective is returned, allowing us to update the above
estimations. By this repeated estimation-sampling-updating pro-
cedure, we prove the algorithm is minimax optimal with respect
to the total time horizon 𝑇up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore,
we extend our learning problem to the contextual scenario, where
actions can be featured by additional contextual information, such
as the real-time states and parameters of the action. By introducing
the additional parameterized linear structure connecting the con-
textual features and the main objectives, we propose a variant of the
VarRons algorithm named contextual varied-objective online Newton
step(ConVaRons) algorithm to handle this problem. The proposed
variant takes the same randomized sampling strategy but with ad-
vanced estimation method to achieve better dependency on the
number of actions 𝐾. We empirically test the proposed algorithms
on dynamic classifier selection tasks, where the performance mea-
sure is changing so the corresponding optimal classifier changes
over time, which is an suitable task for LVO. We further test our pro-
posed algorithms on real-world dynamic cluster service allocation
tasks, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.
2 Problem Formulation
In this section, we formalize the LVO problem, introduce our per-
formance measure, and discuss the main challenges in this problem.
The LVO problem. We assume the main objective is a dynamic
weighted combination of 𝑑pre-defined sub-objectives. Different
from traditional scalarized models in multi-objective optimization
where weights are fixed, our focus now is a time-varying weight
w𝑡∈Δ𝑑−11, that represents the different focuses on the sub-
objectives at each time. At each time 𝑡∈[𝑇]:={1,...,𝑇}, once
the weights decided by specific requirements have been obtained,
the learner chooses an action 𝑎𝑡from a candidate action set A, from
this decision the 𝑖-th sub-objective will suffer an action-dependent
loss𝑙𝑖(𝑎𝑡). Notice the specific losses on each sub-objective are not
always available; we focus on the worst case when the learner only
observes the (possibly noisy) feedback 𝑦𝑡on the main objective
ℓ𝑡(𝑎𝑡), which we assume to be bounded in [0,1], such that
E[𝑦𝑡]=ℓ𝑡(𝑎𝑡)=w⊤

The general assumptions. Given an action set Aof size𝐾, there exists a ground truth objective vector L(𝑎)∈[ 0,1]𝑑for each action
𝑎∈A, implying the abilities of handling sub-objectives for each action.

the detailed learning process in Figure 2.
Performance measures. We compare learner’s performance
against the best decision in hindsight each time. Specifically, we first
define the instantaneous regret at time 𝑡as

Similar to most online learning works, by choosing the right action
with respect to the time-varying weight vector, the learner’s goal
is to minimize the following cumulative (pseudo) dynamic regret,

which is the expected sum of the instantaneous regret over the total
time horizon 𝑇, and the expectation is taken with respect to the
randomness of the algorithmic realization.
Challenges. We analyze the main challenges of the LVO prob-
lem into the following three aspects:
•Non-i.i.d. Loss Distribution : the main objective is determined
by the weight vector w𝑡at each time, which we do not put any
assumption on, as it is decided by realistic requirements and tasks.
The weight vector w𝑡can be arbitrarily assigned or even fully
adversarial in the worst case. Consequently, selecting the same
action at different time steps may incur different losses on the main
objective, and thus, the feedback 𝑦𝑡does not follow a consistent
distribution for the same action. This lack of consistency makes
it difficult to estimate the main objective accurately.
•Partial Observability : the learner receives feedback that is re-
lated to the main objective of the selected action only. This implies
the learner not only has to handle the exploration-exploitation
trade-off in traditional bandit learning but also has to handle
the indirect feedback that is only related to the main objective,
without directly revealing the actual losses on the sub-objectives.
•Dynamic Best Action : the best action defined in (3), is dynamic
with respect to the time-varying weight vector w𝑡. This dynamic
nature presents two main challenges. Algorithmically, the al-
gorithm should adapt robustly to the weight at each time, asdifferent weight corresponds to different optimal actions with-
out a static convergence target. Technically, the regret metrics
introduced in (2)and(4)are special cases of dynamic regret [ 47].
The analysis is much more challenging compared with the static
regret that is most analyzed in existing literature. .
Independently solving one of the above challenges is relatively
easy, while it is not the case when they arise simultaneously in a
single problem, especially when we additionally seek the optimal
approaches with provable guarantees.
3 Our approaches
In this section, we introduce the proposed varied-objective online
Newton step(VaRons) algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that the
proposed algorithm is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors
of the time horizon 𝑇. We then extend the proposed algorithm to
the contextual scenario where actions can be represented by some
contextual features, and propose a variant of the VaRons algorithm
and also discuss the corresponding theoretical guarantees.
3.1 VaRons for the LVO problem
Recall that according to the LVO problem formulation, at each time
step, the learner receives the weights for the sub-objectives that
represent the real-time requirements. After receiving the weights,
the learner has to choose an action from the action set. By choosing
such an action, a loss on the main objective is incurred and returned
to the learner, after which the learner can learn about the chosen
action and prepare for future decisions.
Specifically, the algorithm starts with the learning rate 𝛾as input;
how to choose such a learning rate will be specified later in the
theorems. Throughout the whole process, the algorithm maintains
two critical estimations: the estimated objective vector ˆLin(1)for
each action, representing the performance of the action on all sub-
objectives; and the estimated Hessian Hthat is used to approximate
second-order partial derivatives of the loss function. The algorithm
starts by initializing the above estimation-related variables and the
regularization parameter 𝜖. For each time 𝑡∈[𝑇]:={1,...,𝑇}, the
algorithm first receives the weight vector w𝑡, which represents
the specific emphasis on each sub-objective from the environment,
according to which the algorithm can estimate the main objec-
tive for each action according to the current estimations. The al-
gorithm then computes a 𝐾-dimensional distribution 𝑝𝑡, which

𝑎=11
𝛾(ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎)+𝜆)is strictly monotone for any
𝛾>0, the correct parameter 𝜆can be found efficiently by binary
search. Once the algorithm obtains the estimated loss distribution
on the main objective 𝑝𝑡, it selects an action 𝑎𝑡through random
sampling from this distribution. Sampling actions according to
such an estimated loss distribution is also known as follow-the-
regularized-leader (FTRL) with log-barrier regularizer [3].
By this decision-making of choosing the sampled 𝑎𝑡, a loss on the
main objective with respect to 𝑎𝑡is incurred, representing whether
such a choice is good or not; meanwhile, feedback 𝑦𝑡related to
such a loss, as is assumed in (1), is returned to the algorithm. Upon
receiving the feedback, the algorithm conducts online Newton step
(ONS) [ 16] to update the estimation of the current choice 𝑎𝑡. Specif-
ically, the ONS update involves two steps: the first step is to update
the Hessian estimation of the current choice 𝑎𝑡by
H(𝑎𝑡)← H(𝑎𝑡)+4 𝑦𝑡−ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎𝑡)2w𝑡w⊤
𝑡, (5)
and the second step is to update the estimated sub-objective vector
of the action 𝑎𝑡,
ˆL(𝑎𝑡)←ΠH(𝑎𝑡)
[0,1]𝑑ˆL(𝑎𝑡)+32 𝑦𝑡−ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎𝑡)H(𝑎𝑡)−1w𝑡

where ΠH(𝑎𝑡)
[0,1]𝑑[·]:=arg minx∈[0,1]𝑑√︁
(x−·)⊤H(𝑎𝑡)(x−·)is the
projection operator onto [0,1]𝑑in the norm induced by H(𝑎𝑡).
After updating the estimations with respect to the current choice
𝑎𝑡by ONS, the algorithm steps into the next time and repeat the
above estimating-sampling-updating procedures until time 𝑇. We
present our proposed algorithm in Algorithm 1.
As we can see, the proposed VaRons algorithm is mainly com-
posed of two critical components: ONS and FTRL with log-barrier
regularizer. What’s interesting about these two components is that
they not only handle different difficulties respectively but also are
mutually complementary. Specifically, as discussed previously, the
main challenges of the LVO problem are three-folded: non-i.i.d. lossdistribution of the main objective and partial observability make
it difficult to estimate the main objective accurately, the dynamic
best action requires an adaptive selection strategy without much
dependence on historical choices. Accordingly, as a second-order
optimization method that achieves fast rate convergence estimation,
ONS treats the non-i.i.d. loss distribution with sufficient conver-
gence rate to track such variations; meanwhile, ONS avoids directly
estimating the loss on the main objective. Instead, ONS maintains
action-wise loss estimations on all sub-objectives ˆLfor each action,
according to which ONS can then recover the loss on the main objec-
tive based on the linear structure in (1), solving the difficulty posed
by partial observability. Meanwhile, FTRL with log-barrier regular-
izer, samples an action accordingly by constructing a distribution.
Since this sampling distribution is adaptive to the loss estimation
provided by ONS, the actions sampled by FTRL with log-barrier are
also adaptive to the ONS estimations, thus overcoming the difficulty
posed by a dynamic best action. However, as a second-order opti-
mization method, ONS requires the exponential-concave condition
of the loss function, which our regret definition in (2)and(4)do not
satisfy. In light of the analysis in Foster and Rakhlin [12], we state
that the randomized sampling strategy of FTRL with log-barrier can
provide exponential-concavity for the ONS, which guarantees ONS
can be correctly conducted. We put the corresponding theoretical
discussion of this statement in Appendix A.
The following theorem ensures that our proposed approach is
minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors of 𝑇.

Remark 1 (Minimax optimality.). We construct the lower bound
for the general LVO by considering the following special case: setting
the weight vector w𝑡=[1,0,..., 0]for all𝑡∈[𝑇], and thus only
the first sub-objective matters and the main objective is exactly the
first sub-objective. In this case, the general problem reduces to the
traditional𝐾-armed bandits problem, whose minimax lower bound is
Ω(√
𝐾𝑇)given by [ 5,15]. This means there exists a problem instance
(the above instance) that no algorithm can enjoy regret better than
our results in terms of total time horizon 𝑇, and thus, our result is
minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors of 𝑇.
Notice that the dependency on the number of actions 𝐾in our
result is linear and thus sub-optimal. When the number of actions 𝐾
is large, this could result in additional computational intractability.
In the following part, we extend our approach to scenarios where
the actions are represented by 𝑚-dimensional feature vectors. We
demonstrate that, with an additional assumption, the linear depen-
dency ofO(𝐾)can be further improved to O(√
𝐾).
3.2 The contextual variant of LVO
In this part, we extend our learning problem to the contextual
scenario, where actions are described with extra information. For
example, each individual mode can be treated as a combination of
 
2133Handling Varied Objectives by Online Decision Making KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
several parameter settings and states. This parameterized combina-
tion can then be treated as the contextual feature of the action.
We formulate the contextual LVO problem where actions are
represented by contextual features as follows: we follow the as-
sumptions of linear bandits [ 1,2], where each action is represented
by an𝑚-dimensional bounded contextual feature X(𝑎)∈[ 0,1]𝑚,
and each sub-objective can be linearly represented by such contex-
tual features. Formally, for each of the sub-objectives, there exists a
parameter𝜃𝑖∈R𝑚such that
𝑙𝑖(𝑎)=𝜃⊤
𝑖X(𝑎),∀𝑖∈[𝑑]. (7)
Again, the𝑙𝑖(𝑎)is the loss on the 𝑖-th sub-objective for action 𝑎.
Based on the proposed VaRons algorithm, we proposed its vari-
ant for the contextual LVO: the ConVaRons algorithm, short for
contextual varied-objective online Newton step. The algorithm first
initializes the inversed learning rate 𝛽and the regularization pa-
rameter𝜖. Similar to the procedure in VaRons, for each time 𝑡∈[𝑇],
the algorithm receives the weight vector w𝑡and estimates the main
objective for each action, and the sampling distribution 𝑝𝑡is cal-
culated, according to which an action is sampled, then the loss
on the main objective is incurred with corresponding feedback
returned to the learner. The above procedure is almost the same
as in Algorithm 1, except that we need a small adaptation when
estimating the main objective from the view of sub-objectives: the
algorithm first reshapes the estimated parameter, which is a (𝑑𝑚)-
dimensional vector, into a 𝑑×𝑚matrix ˆΘ, such that ˆΘ𝑖,𝑗=ˆ𝜃(𝑖−1)𝑚+𝑗
for𝑖∈[𝑑],𝑗∈[𝑚]. The physical intuition of the matrix is obvious:
each roll corresponds to a sub-objective, and each column corre-
sponds to the linear parameter in (7). When the feedback ℓ𝑡(𝑎𝑡)is
returned, the algorithm performs the ONS update as follows: the
algorithm first constructs the dummy vector z𝑡∈R𝑑𝑚as follows,
z𝑡,𝑘=w𝑡,𝑖X𝑗(𝑎),𝑖=𝑘
𝑚
,𝑗=𝑘−𝑚(𝑖−1),𝑘∈[𝑑𝑚],(8)
where the footnote regarding 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 specifies the corresponding
entries in the vector z𝑡. After transforming the contextual features
to a dummy vector, we update corresponding estimations as follows,

ˆ𝜃←ΠH

ˆ𝜃+2

. (10)
With the updated estimation, the algorithm repeats the above
estimating-sampling-updating procedure until the time horizon 𝑇.
We summarize the proposed ConVaRons algorithm in Algorithm 2.
The difficulty within contextual LVO is how to deal with the
correlations between actions brought by the contextual structure
in(7). Specifically, in the general LVO, we make no assumptions
about the relationships within actions, and thus, they are estimated
independently, with updating only for the current choice 𝑎𝑡; in con-
trast, due to the contextual structure, actions within the action set
are no longer independent to each other but share the same under-
lying linear model. In this case, we adopt different ONS estimations
of the loss on the main objective. Unlike maintaining action-wise
estimations in Algorithm 1 that total 𝐾independent estimations
are needed, ONS in ConVaRons maintains a single estimation of the
underlying linear parameter ˆ𝜃∈R𝑑𝑚, as well as the correspondingAlgorithm 2 ConVaRons :Contextual Varied-objective

Hessian estimation 𝐻∈R𝑑𝑚×𝑑𝑚. By combining all estimations
into the same parameter, selecting any action provides information
about the underlying linear parameters.
Formally speaking, the following theorem states that the O(𝐾)
dependence of Algorithm 1 can be improved by to O(√
𝑚𝐾)by
Algorithm 2, and meanwhile preserves the minimax optimality,
Theorem 3.2. Choosing optimal learning rate 𝛾=O√︃

,
Algorithm 2 ensures a cumulative (pseudo) dynamic regret for the
contextual LVO that is upper bounded by

.
Remark 2 (Minimax optimality). The sub-optimal linear depen-
dency ofO(𝐾)for Algorithm 1 is improved to O√

. Meanwhile,
as for the𝑇dependent term, similar to what we do in the general
case, we can construct the special case by setting W𝑡=[1,0,..., 0]
for all𝑡∈ [𝑇], and thus only the first sub-objective matters and
the main objective is exactly the first sub-objective. In this case, the
general problem reduces to the stochastic linear bandits with finitely
many arms, whose minimax lower bound is Ω(√︁
𝑚𝑇log(𝑇/𝑚))given
by [22]. This implies the ConVaRons algorithm preserves the minimax
optimality in terms of 𝑇up to logarithmic factors.
4 Experiments
In this section, we conduct experiments on two applications of the
proposed LVO problem, estimating the efficacy of our approaches.
4.1 Dynamic classifier selection
Classifiers optimal for one objective may be sub-optimal for an-
other [ 45], necessitating adaptive selection as data characteristics
and performance metrics change, a process known as dynamic clas-
sifier selection (DCS) [ 17,44]. DCS is an ensemble method where,
after training multiple classifiers, one or a combination of classifiers
is dynamically selected for test instances. In our experiments, we
simplify DCS by selecting one classifier at a time, modeling it as an
 
2134KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Lanjihong Ma, Zhen-Yu Zhang, Yao-Xiang Ding, and Zhi-Hua Zhou
example of the LVO problem. This approach has many real-world
applications. For instance, in an autonomous driving system (Fig-
ure 1), different modes can be seen as trained classifiers performing
variably across metrics. On simple roads, accuracy and F1 score are
primary, while on complex roads, the End-to-End Lateral Deviation
(E2E-LD) metric is more suitable [30].
In this part, we conduct experiments on an application of the
LVO problem: the dynamic classifier selecting tasks, where data
come with a stream with varied performance metrics.
4.1.1 Selecting Non-contextual Classifiers. In this part, we conduct
classifier selection tasks on non-contextual classifiers.
Basic Settings . We conduct the experiment on the IJCNN1
dataset [ 8]. Specifically, we first train 10Core Vector Machine clas-
sifiers [ 34] on the training data. These classifiers are served as the
action set of online decision-making problem. For each classifier, the
evaluation metrics include accuracy, f1-score, Area Under the ROC
Curve (AUC), and average precision (AP), which are taken as the
sub-objectives. The main objective combines these sub-objectives
into a composite measure. For each time step 𝑡=1,..., 1000, we
generate a weight vector to represent potential variations in these
sub-objectives. Upon receiving the weight vector, the algorithm
selects one classifier from the 10trained classifiers. Then, we ran-
domly sample 5%of the test data to simulate the mini-batch in
streaming data for evaluation. The selected classifier is tested on
the mini-batch and incurs the loss on the main objective, which is
then returned to the algorithm for future selections. The goal is to
minimize the loss concerning the main objective.
Simulated weights variations . We establish the following two
variation environments for the weights in the main objective:
•Drift: the environment simulates the cases when the weight
vector varies smoothly. Specifically, the weight vector initially
starts at w𝑡=[1,0,0,0]and gradually transitions to the uniform
distribution and then to w𝑡=[0,1,0,0]. The procedure continues
for the third and fourth sub-objectives for several times till end.
•Random: the environment simulates user-specific tasks, with
each user having distinct requirements for the classifier. Conse-
quently, the weight vector at each time is randomly generated in
a4-dimensional simplex.
To quantify the variation of the main objective, we define the
weight path length as P𝑇:=Í𝑇−1
𝑡=1∥w𝑡+1−w𝑡∥2
2. The weight path
length for driftP𝑇=14represents a mild variation; the weight path
length for Random P𝑇=470represents a more drastic variation.
Contenders. We compare the VaRons algorithm with the fol-
lowing state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms in the most
related topics; the specific reason for such choosing is given in
Appendix B. Parameters are set optimally according to theoretical
guidance.
•Ground truth Pareto front (GT-PF). This method randomly chooses
one action from the ground truth Pareto front. Notice that MOO
methods searching for the Pareto front will always converge
to the ground truth result, and thus, this approach includes the
best MOO algorithms by assuming they successfully identify the
Pareto front at the beginning.
•EXP3.S [ 5]. The EXP3.S algorithm handles adversarial rewards,
which makes it possible to handle decision-making with time-
varying bandit feedback on the main objective.

dard deviation region. The lower the results, the better. We
conduct for 𝐾=6,8,10actions under both ’drift’ and ’ran-
dom’ environmental settings. Our algorithm, VaRons, ex-
hibits lower regret compared to contenders in most cases.
•SW-UCB [ 14] and D-UCB [ 20]. The SW-UCB and D-UCB han-
dle non-stationary stochastic bandit feedback, and thus is also
possible to handle time-varying main objective.
Results. We present the average cumulative regret results in
Figure 3, the results are averaged over 20independent trials. As is
presented, VaRons obtains the lowest cumulative regrets in most
scenarios; compared with the GT-PF when the number of actions 𝐾
is small when the cardinality of the Pareto front is small, GT-PF out-
performs our approach, it is emphasized that such results are caused
by the selection of too small time horizon 𝑇, as regrets incurred by
GT-PF are always proportion to 𝑇with small scope, regrets incurred
by VaRons is converging and thus is sub-linear in 𝑇. Meanwhile,
VaRons has similar performance when the variation environment
is different, implying a regret that is irrelevant to the extent of
variation, matching the theoretical findings in Theorem 3.1.
4.1.2 Selecting Parameterized Classifiers. In this part, we focused
on the parameterized classifier selection, where classifiers are pa-
rameterized and described as an application for the contextual LVO.
Data and task description. We select classifiers, which are pa-
rameterized represented, on the SNW data set [ 48] and the NoC
data set [ 4]. The SNW dataset contains 206different designs syn-
thesized for a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform,
each characterized by a 4-dimensional contextual representation.
The sub-objectives are two conflicting aspects of chip designs: area
andthroughput. The NOC dataset contains 259different NoC im-
plementations, each represented by a 5-dimensional contextual
representation. The sub-objectives of these implementations are en-
ergy consumption andrunning time. Similarly, we generated weights
at each time to simulate possible variation scenarios.
Simulated weights variations Similarly, we set 2variation
environments: the drift scenario with weight path length P𝑇=
30, and the random scenario with weight path length P𝑇=470,
representing mild and drastic variation environments, respectively.
Meanwhile, we randomly select 𝐾=10,20,40designs as the action
sets, each represented by its corresponding contextual features.
Contenders. We compare the proposed ConVaRons algorithm
(Algorithm 2) with the following state-of-the-art algorithms of the
most related topics; all parameters are set optimally according to

give the reason of choosing these contenders is given in Appendix B,

randomly, representing the MOO-type of methods.

Results. The cumulative results on the two tasks are presented in
Table 2 and Table 3 in mean ±std (rank) format. Similarly, the results
are averaged on 20independent trials. Again, GT-PF outperforms
our approach in some tasks in the NOC dataset. We explain this by
the existence of noisy data such that the linear assumption in (7)
does not entirely hold in this dataset, and thus approximating sub-
objectives with this linear structure introduces extra inaccuracy in
estimations. However, our proposed ConVaRons still obtains the
best (or tied for best) averaged performance over all tasks.
4.2 Cluster service allocation
In this part, we focus on large-scale cluster service allocation tasks.
4.2.1 Task description. We conduct experiments on the online ser-
vice cluster trace data from the Alibaba Cluster Trace Program,2
which contains 1.4𝑀users’ requirements on online service in time
sequence. The task focuses on designing algorithms for cluster
service providers to allocate computational tasks to different ma-
chines. Specifically, the service provider first categorizes available
machines into several clusters according to configurations, each
has different performance on processing abilities, memory size,
and storage capabilities. We take each cluster as an optional action
in the action set. With the timestamp, users continuously submit
their computational tasks to the service provider, each with dif-
ferent requirements for CPU, memory, and disk space, which we

Figure 4: Cumulative regret results on the dynamic cluster
service allocation task, the error presents the standard de-
viation region. A lower regret indicates a better allocation
strategy. Notice that the SW-UCB and D-UCB algorithms
are deterministic strategies decided by user requests in the
records; there are no error regions for these two algorithms.
take as the sub-objectives. For each submitted task, the service
provider first obtains the weights for sub-objectives according to
the specific requirements and then allocates this task to the most
suitable cluster. The main objective is to maximize the overall Qual-
ity of Service (QoS), which is assumed to be a weighted combina-
tion of sub-objectives as different clusters may prioritize different
sub-objectives, resulting in different overall QoS. We note that the
cluster service allocation task is also related to the recently pro-
posed new paradigm called CoRE-Learning [46], which takes the
computational resource into account of machine learning theory.
4.2.2 Constructing the LVO problem. In this part, we introduce
how we process available data to construct an LVO problem.
Assigning weights for sub-objectives . We allocate weights
based on user-defined requirements for CPU, memory, and disk
space according to the Bradley–Terry model [ 7]. Specifically, we
rescale these requests to standard distributions. Then, we assign
weights in proportion to the exponential of their scaled values. This
approach ensures a sensitive weight distribution, reflecting the
relative significance of each requirement. For instance, the weight
for CPU is assigned as:
w𝑡(CPU) =exp(scaled sub-objective 1requirement)
Í3
𝑖=1exp(scaled sub-objective 𝑖requirement).
Constructing the Decision-Making Framework . To avoid
mismatches between the algorithm’s selections and historical allo-
cations, we follow the evaluation method of Li et al. [21], Mehrotra
et al. [24]. This method validates a task only if the selected cluster by
the algorithm aligns with its historical allocation. Non-valid tasks
are skipped until 𝑇=1000 tasks are reached. For each valid match,
we take QoS as the returned feedback 𝑦𝑡. Specifically, the QoS is
categorized into five levels: Excellent (Ex), Satisfactory (Sa), Stan-
dard (St), Substandard (Su), and Unsatisfactory (Un), corresponding
to loss intervals of[0,0.2],[0.2,0.4],[0.4,0.6],[0.6,0.8],[0.8,1], re-
spectively. For analytical convenience, we convert these levels into
scalar losses at the midpoint of intervals: 0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9.
The contextual LVO settings . For each cluster, we can char-
acterize it with some performance metrics, such as cycles per in-
struction (CPI), misses per thousand instructions (MPKI), and real-
time disk load that represent the execution time, cache usage, and
response times, respectively. We take these critical states as the
cluster’s contextual feature and additionally conduct contextual
LVO experiments on the proposed ConVaRons algorithm.
 
2136KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Lanjihong Ma, Zhen-Yu Zhang, Yao-Xiang Ding, and Zhi-Hua Zhou
Contenders . Similar to the experiments in Section 4.1, we select
EXP3.S [ 5], SW-UCB [ 14], D-UCB [ 20] and GT-PF as the contenders
for VaRons in the general LVO, and SW-LinUCB [ 9], D-LinUCB [ 28],
RestartUCB [ 41] and GT-PF as the contenders for ConVaRons in
the contextual LVO.
4.2.3 Results. We present the cumulative regret results in Figure 4
and additionally illustrate the loss of each user’s request in Figure 5.
For better illustration, we combined the results of other contenders
except GT-PF. As the loss for each user request represented by the
shadow is too noisy, we additionally draw the smoothed average
loss, that averaged on the past 50user requests, as well as the overall
averaged loss. In both cases, our proposed algorithm presents lower
losses than contenders, indicating a better allocation strategy with
higher adaptivity to each user’s specific requirements.
5 Related work
The LVO problem shares characteristics with multi-dimensional
and non-stationary losses. Here, we briefly discuss two related areas
and explain why existing algorithms cannot directly address the
LVO problem. Detailed discussions are presented in Appendix B.
The LVO problem arises in open-environment machine learning
(open ML) [ 45], which fundamentally differs from conventional
static machine learning. Open ML faces unique challenges such as
the emergence of new classes [ 10,38,42], evolving features [ 18,39],
shifting data distributions [ 31,40], and varied learning objectives.
Handling varied objectives is a crucial yet underexplored problem
within this context. As objectives shift with specific requirements,
open environments necessitate machine learning models that are
highly flexible and adaptable. Effectively handling varied objectives
is fundamental to addressing practical problems in open ML.
One related area is multi-objective decision-making methods,
particularly multi-objective multi-armed bandits [11,26,32], which
focus on actions with multi-dimensional losses. Drugan and Nowé
[11] proposed both Pareto and scalarized optimality settings. While
most subsequent works [ 6,25] focus on Pareto optimality, scalarized
optimality, which combines sub-objectives using fixed weights, is
more relevant to our problem. However, as the weights are assumed
to be fixed, it is not suitable to handle changing weights.
Another relevant area is decision-making based on non-stationary
losses. This approach treats the main objective as a non-stationary
target, with action-wise loss changing based on varying weight
vectors. The LVO problem can be viewed as a special case of non-
stationary decision-making, where each action corresponds to a
non-stationary reward or loss. Algorithms like Exp3.S [ 5] guaran-
tee an optimalO(√𝑆𝑇𝑇)regret bound, where 𝑆𝑇is the number
of distribution shifts by time 𝑇. Subsequent algorithms, such as
D-UCB and SW-UCB [14, 20], share this optimality.
For the contextual extension of LVO, the linear structure assump-
tion is similar to those in stochastic linear bandits [ 1,2], especially
non-stationary stochastic linear bandits [ 9,36]. Algorithms like SW-
LinUCB [ 9], D-LinUCB [ 28], and RestartUCB [ 41] share sub-optimal
O(𝑃1
4
𝑇𝑇3
4)regret, where 𝑃𝑇measures environmental changes. How-
ever,𝑆𝑇=Θ(𝑇)and𝑃𝑇=Θ(𝑇)in the worst case, the regret bound
is linearly dependent on 𝑇, implying that selections do not con-
verge to the best action. Hence, handling LVO with reduction to
non-stationary linear bandits are not suitable.

(b) Contextual case
Figure 5: Loss according to QoS of VaRons algorithm against
GT-PF and an average of other contenders on the cluster allo-
cation tasks. Lower loss represents better allocation strategy.
In the non-contextual case, VaRons shows consistent loss
minimization, closely followed by GT-PF, with the overall
average loss for each algorithm indicated by dashed lines;
for the contextual case, ConVaRons and GT-PF exhibit sim-
ilar trends, with VaRons maintaining a lower loss profile as
evidenced by the overall average.
6 Conclusion and Future work
We present a formulation of two settings within the problem of
Learning with Varied Objectives (LVO): the general LVO, which
lacks contextual representation for each action, and the contextual
LVO, where actions are characterized by contextual features. For
these respective settings, we introduce the VaRons and ConVaRons
algorithms, both of which are provably minimax optimal in terms
of𝑇, up to logarithmic factors. Empirically, we validate the efficacy
of our approaches through dynamic classifier selection and clus-
ter service allocation tasks, providing empirical evidence for our
theoretical findings. As discussed in the experiment part, our pro-
posed algorithms for LVO may be useful for CoRE-learning [ 19,46],
particularly when considering varying objectives during resource
allocation. We leave this for future investigation.

A Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we provide the theoretical proofs for the main theo-
rems: Theorem 3.1 for VaRons and Theorem 3.2 for ConVaRons.
A.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1
We first focus on Theorem 3.1 for VaRons in the general Learning
with Varied objectives (LVO) problem. As mentioned in the main
text, our algorithm comprises two key components: Follow-the-
Regularized-Leader (FTRL) with a log-barrier regularizer, and the
Online Newton Step (ONS). The following lemma states that the
cumulative (pseudo) regret defined in (4)can be upper bounded by
the square loss of ONS, plus an additional constant term.
Lemma A.1. Sampling actions according to 𝑝𝑡(𝑎)=1
𝛾(ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎)+𝜆)
(FTRL with log-barrier) guarantees an upper bound on the cumulative

rithm 1).
As shown, the effectiveness of FTRL with a log-barrier regularizer
is two-fold. Firstly, the cumulative (pseudo) regret is upper bounded
by the estimation error on the square loss (Term A), with additional
constant term. If Term A satisfies the exponential-concavity condi-
tion for ONS, it can be considered a surrogate loss function for ONS.
Secondly, the right side of the inequality eliminates the term related
to the dynamic competitor 𝑎∗
𝑡, defined in (3), thereby addressing
the technical difficulties posed by the dynamic competitor.
We now focus on Term A. The following lemma guarantees the
exponential-concavity condition of Term A.
Lemma A.2. For any x∈[0,1]𝑑andw𝑡∈Δ𝑑−1, the loss function
defined by𝑓(x):=(w⊤
𝑡x−𝑦𝑡)2is a1
2-exponential-concave function
with∥∇𝑓(x)∥2≤2√
𝑑. Furthermore, for any y∈[0,1]𝑑, the following
holds:
𝑓(x)≥𝑓(y)+∇𝑓(y)⊤(x−y)+1
32(∇𝑓(y)⊤(x−y))2.
Once Term A fulfills the exponential-concave requirements, we
are now able to estimate the action-wise sub-objective vector L(𝑎)
for all𝑎∈A independently. Recall that L(𝑎)=[𝑙1(𝑎),...,𝑙𝑑(𝑎)]is
a vectorized representation of the losses on sub-objectives of action
𝑎, for an action 𝑎∈A, the following bound holds according to the
analysis in Hazan et al. [16],Lemma A.3. Denote byI(𝑎)as the set of time when 𝑎𝑡=𝑎. The
Online Newton Step (line 7in algorithm 1) guarantees the following
upper bound for Term A,
Term A≤8𝑑log|I(𝑎)|
64+1

With the lemmas above, it is sufficient to analyze Theorem 3.1.

the cumulative pseudo regret is upper bounded by:

A.2 Proof of Theorem 2
The reshaping step in line 4 of ConVaRons (Algorithm 2) and
constructing the dummy vector z𝑡as in (8)ensures that ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎)=
w⊤
𝑡ˆΘX(𝑎)=ˆ𝜃⊤z𝑡, and thus𝑓(Θ)=(w⊤
𝑡ΘX−𝑦𝑡)2corresponds
to𝑔(𝜃)=(z⊤
𝑡𝜃−𝑦𝑡)2. Therefore, one can replace w𝑡and𝜃in
Lemma A.2 with z𝑡and𝜃. Hence, most proofs are based on the
analysis of Theorem 1. We have the following lemma, which is an
adaptation of the original Lemma A.1, Lemma A.2, and Lemma A.3
in the contextual LVO.
Lemma A.4. Sampling actions according to 𝑝𝑡(𝑎)=1
𝛾(ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎)+𝜆)
(FTRL with log-barrier) guarantees an upper bound on the cumulative
pseudo regret of:
¯R𝑇≤𝛾

(ˆℓ𝑡(𝑎)−𝑦𝑡)2−(ℓ𝑡(𝑎𝑡)−𝑦𝑡)2

Term E+(𝐾−1)𝑇

whereℓ𝑡(𝑎)=w⊤
𝑡ΘX(𝑎)=𝜃⊤z𝑡andˆℓ𝑡(𝑎)=w⊤
𝑡ˆΘX(𝑎)=ˆ𝜃⊤z𝑡are
the main objective and its estimation for action 𝑎according to line 5
of ConVaRons (Algorithm 2).
Similarly, when it comes to the conVaRons (algorithm 2), the loss
function shares the same1
2-exponential-concavity as in Lemma A.2.
Formally, we conclude the results as the following lemma:
 
2139Handling Varied Objectives by Online Decision Making KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
Lemma A.5. For any𝜃∈[0,1]𝑑𝑚,z𝑡constructed as in (8), where
w𝑡∈Δ𝑑−1andX∈[ 0,1]𝑚, the loss function defined by 𝑓(𝜃):=
(z⊤
𝑡𝜃−𝑦𝑡)2is a1
2-exponential-concave function with ∥∇𝑓(𝜃)∥2≤
2√︃
𝑚
𝑑. Further, for any 𝜂∈[0,1]𝑑𝑚, taking𝛽=minn

16𝑚o
yields
the following inequality:
𝑓(𝜃)≥𝑓(𝜂)+∇𝑓(𝜂)⊤(𝜃−𝜂)+𝛽
2(∇𝑓(𝜂)⊤(𝜃−𝜂))2.
Lemma A.6. The Online Newton Step (line 9 in Algorithm 2) guar-
antees the following upper bound for Term E:
Term E≤8𝑑𝑚log𝑇
64+1
+8.
Notice that the action-wise analysis in Lemma A.3 is based on
the ONS estimation being action-specific. When applying this to
ConVaRons, we replace the 𝐾estimations in VaRons with a single
estimation for the entire action set A, treatingAas a super-action.
This approach still holds since Lemma A.3 focuses solely on esti-
mations, not on the decision-making or sampling process. There-
fore, if Lemma A.3 holds for any arbitrary action 𝑎over the time
intervalI(A) , it should also hold for the super-action A. With
𝑛𝑇=|I(A)| =𝑇,∥∇𝑓(𝜃)∥2≤2√︃
𝑚
𝑑and ˆ𝜃∈[0,1]𝑑𝑚(different
from the estimation in Lemma A.3 where ˆL∈[0,1]𝑑), the analysis
is almost the same, we omit this part.
With above lemmas, the proof of Theorem 3.2 follows:
Proof of Theorem 3.2. Combining the results in Lemma A.4
and Lemma A.6, we have:

B Full Related Works
As our problem shares the characteristic of varying objective in-
cluding several sub-objectives and constantly changing weight
vectors that defines the main objective, we separate possible related
decision-making approaches that may help to solve the LVO prob-
lem into two categories: the multi-objective type of methods, and
the non-stationary type of methods.
We first focus on the multi-objective type of methods . Decision-
making approach that handles multiple objectives is the Multi-
objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB). As each action corre-
sponds to a multi-dimensional reward, LVO is closely related to the
MO-MAB problem, formally proposed by Drugan and Nowé [11].
Drugan and Nowé [11] propose both the Pareto and scalarized opti-
mality settings. While most subsequent works [ 6,25] focus on the
Pareto optimality setting, where the goal is to find the Pareto opti-
mal set of actions, the scalarized optimality setting, which assumes
the main objective can be represented by the weighted combina-
tion of sub-objectives, is more related to our problem. The onlydifference is that LVO problem considers time-varying weights. To
handle the scalarized MO-MAB problem, Drugan and Nowé [11]
proposed the Scalarized MO-UCB algorithm that finds the scalarized
optimal action, Yahyaa and Manderick [37] propose the LS-KG and
SMOMAB algorithms that utilize knowledge gradient policy [ 29]
and Thompson sampling [ 33] to handle linear scalarized MO-MAB.
These works assume the scalarization function is known in advance,
based on which Roijers et al. [27] propose the ITS algorithm that
learns the scalarization function by interacting with users. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no prior work addresses a time-varying
scalarization function, particularly a time-varying weight.
Another line of decision-making research that may help solve
the LVO problem is the non-stationary type of methods . These
methods ignore the internal structure of sub-objectives and treat
the action-wise main objective as a non-stationary target. Thus, the
LVO problem can be viewed as a special case of non-stationary
multi-armed bandits, where each action corresponds to a non-
stationary reward or loss. Auer et al. [5]propose the Exp3.S al-
gorithm, which guarantees an optimal O(√𝑆𝑇𝑇)regret bound for
adversarial bandits, where 𝑆𝑇is the number of distribution shifts by
time𝑇. Kocsis and Szepesvári [20] propose the D-UCB algorithm
for stochastic non-stationary bandits, introducing a discount factor
so that recent observations have more weight than older ones in
the estimation. Garivier and Moulines [14] further prove that the
D-UCB algorithm shares the same optimality as Exp3.S in the sto-
chastic non-stationary bandits problem. Additionally, Garivier and
Moulines [14] propose the SW-UCB algorithm, which considers
only the most recent observations within a fixed-length sliding
window for reward estimation, and prove that SW-UCB shares
the same-order optimality as Exp3.S and D-UCB. For the contex-
tual extension of LVO, the linear structure in (7)is very similar
to the linear structural assumption in stochastic linear bandits
[1,2], especially non-stationary stochastic linear bandits [ 9] when
the reward distribution changes over time. Inspired by the slid-
ing window and discounted ideas of Garivier and Moulines [14]
and Kocsis and Szepesvári [20], Cheung et al. [9]propose the SW-
LinUCB algorithm, and Russac et al. [28] propose the D-LinUCB
algorithm. Subsequently, Zhao et al. [41] propose the RestartUCB
algorithm, which restarts the reward estimation whenever the dis-
tribution changes significantly. All the above algorithms guarantee
a sub-optimalO(𝑃1
4
𝑇𝑇3
4)regret, where 𝑃𝑇is the path length of
the linearization parameter that quantifies the extent of distribu-
tion changes. Wei and Luo [36]improve the bound to an optimal
O(𝑃1
3
𝑇𝑇2
3)by combining a non-stationarity detector with base algo-
rithms that perform well in stationary environments. The central
difficulty lies in handling the arbitrarily changing weight vectors.
In the worst case, the number of switching times can be 𝑆𝑇=Θ(𝑇),
resulting in anO(𝑇)regret bound that is linearly dependent on time
𝑇. This implies that the algorithm does not eventually converge to
the correct action. A similar difficulty arises in the contextual case,
where𝑃𝑇=Θ(𝑇)leads to a linear regret bound of O(𝑇). Therefore,
directly applying existing algorithms for non-stationary bandits is
infeasible in the worst case. However, in milder scenarios where
𝑆𝑇or𝑃𝑇are smaller, there remains a possibility that this approach
could partially address the LVO problem.
