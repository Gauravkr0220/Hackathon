ABSTRACT
Rankings are increasingly used as part of human decision-making
processes to most effectively allocate reviewing resources. Many
of these processes have complex constraints, and we identify slot
constraints as a model for a wide range of application problems –
from college admission with limited slots for different majors, to
composing a stratified cohort of eligible participants in a medical
trial. In this paper, we formalize the slot-constrained ranking prob-
lem as producing a ranking that maximizes the number of filled
slots if candidates are evaluated by a human decision maker for
slot eligibility in the order of the ranking. We show that naive adap-
tations of the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) can be highly
sub-optimal for slot-constrained ranking problems, and we devise a
new ranking algorithm, called MatchRank. MatchRank generalizes
the PRP, and it subsumes the PRP as a special case when there are
no slot constraints. Our theoretical analysis shows that MatchRank
has a strong approximation guarantee without any independence
assumptions between slots or candidates. Furthermore, we show
how MatchRank can be implemented efficiently. Beyond the theo-
retical guarantees, empirical evaluations show that MatchRank can
provide substantial improvements over a range of synthetic and
real-world tasks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Rankings have become a ubiquitous interface whenever there is
a need to focus attention among an otherwise impractically or
intractably large number of options. Beyond their conception as
an interface for query-based retrieval [e.g., 31], rankings are now
widely used in related tasks like recommendation and advertising.
In addition, a substantial number of new ranking applications come
with new types of constraints, and we identify the notion of slot
constraints as a frequent requirement. With slot constraints we refer
to capacity constraints for different types of relevant candidates.
For example, there is only a certain number of slots for each major
in a college admissions task; or the cohort of a medical trial may
need to fulfill constraints on gender and race to be representative
[7]; and in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline we may have assortment
constraints [ 41]. In these applications, the goal is to fill all slots
with relevant candidates, and each candidate can have a different
probability of relevance for each slot.
For rankings without constraints, the Probability Ranking Prin-
ciple (PRP) [ 30] has long been understood to provide the ranking
that maximizes the number of relevant candidates that are found
in the top-𝑘of the ranking, for any 𝑘. However, the PRP does not
apply to ranking problems with slot constraints, and naive exten-
sions of the PRP can be highly sub-optimal by disparately spending
human evaluation effort on candidates for which there are no open
slots while ignoring other candidates that are relevant for unfilled
slots. Furthermore, ranking with slot constraints is different from
both intrinsically and extrinsically diversified ranking [ 28], since
it involves a vector of relevance probabilities for each candidate
and it allows us to put explicit constraints on the set of relevant
results. Conventional diversification methods cannot handle rele-
vance vectors, and they typically focus on the composition of the
ranking instead of on the composition of the relevant results (e.g.,
demographic parity [ 17]). Furthermore, they typically do not allow
the specification of explicit constraints (e.g., [9, 10, 43]).
To remedy this shortcoming, we formalize and address the prob-
lem of ranking with slot constraints in this paper. In our formulation,
a human decision maker can define an arbitrary set of slots (e.g.,

admission slots for each major) that need to be filled with relevant
candidates (i.e., qualified students). The ranker then supports the
human decision maker in allocating the evaluation effort while
leaving the relevance decisions to the human. Specifically, given a
relevance model that estimates the relevance probability of each
candidate for each slot, the goal is to compute a ranking under
which the expected number of filled slots is maximized. This model
is very general, as candidates can be qualified for any number of
slots, and we can use any probabilistic model with arbitrary depen-
dencies between the slot relevances of all candidates.
Under this model, we show that there is a connection between
slot-constrained ranking and bipartite matching, and we derive a
general ranking algorithm, called MatchRank, that merely requires
efficient sampling from the relevance model. We theoretically ana-
lyze MatchRank and show that it provides a strong approximation
guarantee. In particular, we prove that any top- 𝑘of the ranking
computed by MatchRank guarantees an expected number of filled
slots that is asymptotically at most (1−1/𝑒)away from the optimal
set with high probability. Furthermore, we show how MatchRank
can be implemented efficiently to handle ranking problems of sub-
stantial size. Finally, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation
of MatchRank, showing that it can outperform heuristic baselines
by a substantial margin, and perform accurately on a real-world
college-admission problem.
2 RELATED WORK
In the following we detail how our new setting of ranking with slot
constraints differs from existing research areas.
Search result diversification is a widely studied problem in
IR in which one aims to cover multiple intents or aspects of an
ambiguous or composite query. Specifically, in extrinsic diversi-
fication [ 28] the goal is to cover all intents of a query to ensure
that the user finds at least one relevant result despite the uncer-
tainty about the query intent. This typically leads to coverage-style
objectives [ 9,42], not matching problems like in slot-constrained
ranking. For intrinsic diversification [ 28], the goal to put together
a portfolio of items, but none of the existing methods provides the
same flexibility in specifying complex systems of slots with arbi-
trary dependencies. Another difference of our setting to existing
diversification approaches is that we do not need to model simi-
larity between items, either explicitly through predefined aspects
[32] or implicitly through similarity metrics [ 36]. However, one
could use our slot-constrained ranking framework as a method for
diversification, especially in high-stakes selection problems where
practitioners require both full transparency and control over the
composition of the set of selected items, and the ability to specify
complex real-world matching constraints.
Beyond the standard diversity settings, Agarwal et al . [2] con-
sider how to maximize user engagement while satisfying a min-
imum impression requirement per search result. However, their
target objective is not a matching problem, since serving an item to
one user does not exclude the use of such item with another user.
Also related but different from our setting is the approach of Dang
and Croft [13]. Their “seats” allocation approach is relevant to our
slot constraints, except that we directly treat the slots as a constraintinstead of a normalization factor. Therefore, we use the maximum
bipartite matching algorithm [19] for the ranking objective.
Fairness in ranking is also frequently implemented by adding
constraints to the ranking, since ranking by predicted merit can
lead to both poor representation [ 4] and suboptimal performance
[29] of admitted cohorts. In many cases, these fairness constraints
ensure a certain amount of representation from different groups
in various positions of the ranking (e.g., demographic parity) [ 17,
22]. This is critically different from our slot constraints, since slot
constraints act on the relevant items, not all items. Note that under
differential estimation accuracy between groups, merely ensuring
representational fairness can still be unfair to the relevant items [ 16,
33]. Furthermore, slot constraints are different from independent
diversity constraints [ 8], as slot constraints are always mutually
exclusive (e.g., college applicants can only be admitted by and
matriculate in 1 major of studies).
Matching problems have a wide range of applications in job
markets, dating, and resource allocation in online clouds [ 14,21,38].
The typical setting in stochastic matching is that each edge in a graph
is realized independently with (predicted) probability 𝑝[1,5], which
is analogous to the college admission scenario where we only have
a calibrated regression model to know the predicted probability
of a candidate 𝐶being relevant to a slot 𝑆. Dickerson et al . [14]
consider online bipartite matching to improve the diversity and
relevance of search results by maximizing a multilinear objective
over the set of matched edges. Ahmed et al . [3] propose a quadratic
programming based objective for the diversity of a matching and
propose a scalable greedy algorithm to trade off efficiency and
diversity. Instead of evaluating an objective on top of matching on
a sampled graph, we use the size of the bipartite matching on a
sampled graph to derive a ranking of candidates that maximizes the
size of the bipartite matching in the true relevance matrix during the
human evaluation phase. We are the first to formulate this ranking
problem to maximize the size of the bipartite matching, and this is a
core contribution of this paper.
3 PROBLEM SETTING
Consider that we have 𝑐candidatesC={𝐶1,...,𝐶𝑐}, and we have
𝑠<𝑐slotsS={𝑆1,...,𝑆𝑠}that we need to fill with relevant can-
didates. Each candidate can be relevant to any number of slots, or
no slots at all. We denote whether candidate 𝐶𝑖is relevant to slot
𝑆𝑗via the matrix entry 𝑅𝑖𝑗∈{0,1}. We use the generic concept
of “relevance” to indicate whether a candidate matches a slot. This
allows us to model a broad range of selection problems as follows:
Hiring: A company has a number of openings for different roles,
with a specific number of interview slots budgeted for each
role. Applicants may be qualified for some subset of roles.
An applicant is relevant for an interview slot if qualified and
interested in the particular opening.
College Admission: Slots correspond to seats in various majors
(100 slots for CS, 50 slots for Math, etc.), and in each major a
certain number of slots is reserved for low socioeconomic
status students. A student is relevant for any slot in a major
if both qualified for and interested in that major.
Medical Trial: Researchers need to find qualifying participants for
a medical trial among millions of electronic health records.
 
957Ranking with Slot Constraints KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
The trial is designed with a certain number of slots by gender,
race and disease severity. Patients are relevant for a slot if
they match demographic requirements and disease severity
determined by further testing.
In all of these application scenarios our goal is to fill all slots with rele-
vant candidates. Throughout this paper we assume that relevance is
binary, but we conjecture that many of our results can be extended
to non-binary relevance values.
If the relevance matrix 𝑅was fully known, the problem of finding
relevant candidates to fill all slots would be solved by the maximum
bipartite matching algorithm [ 19]. In practice, however, we only
have uncertain information 𝑃(𝑅)about the true relevances. 𝑃(𝑅)
can be approximated by a probabilistic relevance prediction model
learned from data ( ˆ𝑃(𝑅)). Furthermore, accurately revealing the
true relevance vector 𝑅𝑖∈{0,1}𝑠of any particular candidate 𝐶𝑖
for all𝑠slots comes at substantial cost. In the admission and hiring
example, assessing relevance requires detailed human review of
the application, and in the medical example it requires additional
medical testing. We would thus like to avoid evaluating candidates
that do not contribute to filling more slots, either because these
candidates are not relevant or because we already have identified
other relevant candidates for these slots.
To achieve this goal, we would like to compute a ranking 𝜎of can-
didates so that evaluating the candidates 𝜎[1],...,𝜎[𝑐]from top to
bottom maximizes the number of filled slots given the information
contained in 𝑃(𝑅). Without slot constraints (i.e., for any candidate
𝐶𝑖:∀𝑗,𝑘:𝑅𝑖𝑗=𝑅𝑖𝑘) the ranking problem has a well-known so-
lution that follows from the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP)
[30]: simply ranking candidates by their probability of relevance is
optimal under most sensible metrics. However, this PRP ranking
can be highly sub-optimal under general slot constraints, as the
following toy example shows.
Example 1 (Suboptimality of PRP for Ranking with Slot
Constraints). Consider a problem with 𝑐=1000 candidates and
𝑠=10slots. Candidates 𝐶1,...,𝐶 500have a probability of relevance of
0.5 for slots𝑆1,...,𝑆 5, and 0 for the other slots. Analogously, candidates
𝐶501,...,𝐶 1000have a probability of relevance of 0.4 for slots 𝑆6,...,𝑆 10,
and 0 for the other slots. Any heuristic based on sorting candidates
by a score computed from their probability of relevance would either
produce a ranking equivalent to 𝐶1,...,𝐶 500,𝐶501,...,𝐶 1000 or equiva-
lent to𝐶501,...,𝐶 1000,𝐶1,...,𝐶 500. However, either ranking would be
highly suboptimal, since one type of slots would not be filled until
after reviewing at least 500 candidates.
Note that this high degree of suboptimality already surfaces in
this particularly simplistic example, where there are only two types
of slots and candidates are relevant to at most one type of slots. In
the more general case, where we can have complex systems of slots
where each candidate can have dependent probabilities of being rel-
evant to multiple slots, it is not even clear how to heuristically apply
the conventional PRP. This motivates the need for a new algorithm
that goes beyond sorting candidates by some heuristic function of
relevance, but that explicitly takes the slot constraints into account.
In the following we develop the MatchRank algorithm that does
not have the inefficiencies of the PRP ranking and that provides
provable guarantees on the quality of the ranking for arbitrary

slot constraints and relevance models. To start the derivation, the
following begins with a formal definition of the ranking objective.
3.1 Ranking Objective
We formalize the problem of ranking under slot constraints in two
steps. We first define the problem of finding a candidate set 𝑋𝑘of
a given size 𝑘that is optimal. In the second step we show how to
construct a nested sequence
𝑋0⊂𝑋1⊂𝑋2⊂... (1)
of such candidate sets that naturally forms a ranking 𝜎. In particular,
any two consecutive candidate sets 𝑋𝑘and𝑋𝑘+1differ by only one
candidate𝑋𝑘+1\𝑋𝑘=𝐶𝜎[𝑘+1], which corresponds to the element
𝜎[𝑘+1]of ranking𝜎. Note that𝑋0is always the empty set.
To evaluate a given candidate set 𝑋⊆C, we use the size of the
maximal matching between relevant candidates in 𝑋and slotsS.
This is illustrated in Figure 1, where the candidates in 𝑋and the
slots inSform a bipartite graph (right panel). The correspond-
ing submatrix of the relevance matrix 𝑅(left panel) defines the
biadjacency matrix of the graph, where an edge exists whenever
a candidate 𝐶𝑖is relevant for slot 𝑆𝑗. The right panel of Figure 1
shows the (not necessarily unique) maximum bipartite matching
{𝐶1→𝑆1,𝐶2→𝑆2,𝐶4→𝑆3}, which corresponds to the largest
number of slots that can be filled with relevant candidates from 𝑋.
We denote this maximum bipartite matching size as MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅).
While MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅)gives us the optimal solution for a known
relevance matrix 𝑅, we need to evaluate candidates sets 𝑋under
uncertainty about what the correct relevance matrix is. A natural
metric for evaluating a candidate set 𝑋under𝑃(𝑅)is to measure the
expected size of the matching, which corresponds to the expected
number of slots that can be filled with candidates from 𝑋.

When evaluating a ranking 𝜎, we will apply this metric 𝑀(𝑋)to
each top-𝑘prefix𝑋𝑘of the ranking 𝜎.
3.2 MatchRank Algorithm
Given the metric 𝑀(𝑋)from Equation (3), our goal is to find a
ranking𝜎of the candidates in Cso that𝑀(𝑋𝑘)for any top-𝑘prefix
is as large as possible under 𝑃(𝑅). We split this goal into three
steps. First, we show how to estimate 𝑀(𝑋)for any candidate set 𝑋
and for any 𝑃(𝑅)that permits sampling. Second, we show how to
construct a single candidate set 𝑋𝑘of size𝑘that has a large value
for𝑀(𝑋𝑘). Third, we show that our construction of the 𝑋𝑘in the
previous step naturally produces a ranking.
Estimating𝑀(𝑋).We do not make any structural assumptions
on the distribution 𝑃(𝑅), and𝑃(𝑅)can contain arbitrary depen-
dencies among the entries. The following is a general method for
evaluating a given candidate set 𝑋, where we merely require that
we can sample relevance matrices 𝑅from𝑃(𝑅). With such samples,
we can compute Monte-Carlo estimates of 𝑀(𝑋)as follows.
LetR=[𝑅1,...,𝑅𝑛]be𝑛samples of relevance matrices drawn
i.i.d. from𝑃(𝑅). The Monte-Carlo estimate of 𝑀(𝑋)is
ˆ𝑀(𝑋)=1
𝑛𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅𝑖). (4)
By the weak law of large numbers, ˆ𝑀(𝑋)converges to 𝑀(𝑋)for
large𝑛. We will later characterize how the number of samples 𝑛
affects the algorithm.
Constructing the ranking. Now that we know how to estimate the
quality ˆ𝑀(𝑋)of any particular candidate set 𝑋, we can think about
finding a candidate set that maximizes ˆ𝑀(𝑋). However, naively
enumerating all subsets 𝑋⊂C of size|𝑋|=𝑘and evaluating ˆ𝑀(𝑋)
would not be efficient. Furthermore, it would not be clear how to
make sure that the candidate set is nested and forms a ranking.
To avoid this combinatorial enumeration, we instead construct
ˆ𝑀(𝑋)using the following greedy algorithm, which we will prove to
enjoy strong approximation guarantees. Since this algorithm adds
one candidate in each iteration, it naturally constructs a ranking
and we show that the approximation guarantees hold for any top- 𝑘
of the ranking.

end while
Output: ranking𝜎
In each iteration 𝑘, the MatchRank algorithm finds the candi-
date𝐶bestthat most improves ˆ𝑀(𝑋𝑘−1∪{𝐶best})for the current
candidate set 𝑋𝑘−1. It then places 𝐶bestinto position 𝑘of the rank-
ing. Furthermore, it adds 𝐶bestto the current top- 𝑘set𝑋𝑘, and it
removes𝐶bestfrom the set of remaining candidates 𝐴. These itera-
tions continue until all candidates have been added to the ranking.If only a top- 𝑘ranking is desired, one could also stop early. Note
that Algorithm 1 is optimized for clarity, but Section 3.4 presents
several efficiency improvements.
3.3 Theoretical Analysis
We now analyze theoretically how effective MatchRank is on con-
structing a ranking that optimizes the objective 𝑀(𝑋)given in
Equation (3). We start by stating our main result, which we will
then prove subsequently. The main result states that for any 𝑘,
the top-𝑘candidate set 𝑋𝑘constructed by MatchRank enjoys an
approximation guarantee compared to the optimal candidate set
𝑋∗
𝑘=argmax
𝑋⊆C∧|𝑋|=𝑘𝑀(𝑋).
Note that these optimal 𝑋∗
𝑘may not be nested and may not form a
ranking, unlike the 𝑋𝑘constructed by MatchRank.

where𝑋∗
𝑘=argmax𝑋⊆C∧|𝑋|=𝑘𝑀(𝑋)is the optimal set.
The proof of Theorem 3.1 is given in Appendix A. Its main
steps are to first show that ˆ𝑀(𝑋)is monotone submodular, which
implies that the greedy nature of MatchRank provides a (1−1/𝑒)
approximation guarantee for ˆ𝑀(𝑋). We then show that optimizing
ˆ𝑀(𝑋)provides a solution that is close to optimizing 𝑀(𝑋)directly.
3.4 Computational Efficiency of MatchRank
and Improvements
The MatchRank algorithm as written in Algorithm 1 is optimized
for clarity, but there are a number of improvements that can sub-
stantially speed up computation. To motivate these improvements,
we first analyze the runtime complexity of Algorithm 1.
For computing the top 𝑘positions of the ranking when there
are𝑐candidates, 𝑠slots, and𝑛Monte-Carlo samples, the greedy
maximizer inside Algorithm 1 will evaluate 𝑂(𝑘𝑐)sets. For each
such set, it will find the MBM solutions of all bipartite graphs from
R, which takes 𝑂(𝑛𝑐𝑠√𝑐+𝑠)time per set when using the classic
Hopcroft-Karp MBM algorithm [ 19]. So, a naive implementation
will take𝑂(𝑘𝑛𝑐2𝑠√𝑐+𝑠)time. However, this implementation is
unnecessarily slow.
We can improve the time efficiency of MatchRank by following
the principle that any unmatched candidate can increase the match-
ing size by at most 1. So, if we are given a candidate set 𝑋⊆C and
an unmatched candidate 𝐶, finding the MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶},S|𝑅)can be
reduced to determining if there is an augmenting path to the match-
ing of MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅)starting from 𝐶. If such an augmenting path
exists, then we can extend the matching and MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶},S|𝑅)=
MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅)+1. It no augmenting path exists, then we will know
that MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶},S|𝑅)=MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅)and the matching re-
mains unchanged. Therefore, it will take 𝑂(𝑐𝑠)time (a BFS) per
each unmatched candidate per ranking step, and we obtain an
𝑂(𝑘𝑛𝑐(𝑐𝑠))=𝑂(𝑘𝑛𝑐2𝑠)algorithm.

If we consider the typical scenario where 𝑐>𝑠, we can improve
the time complexity by keeping a list of unmatched slots instead
of candidates for each bipartite graph, and on each ranking step
we start from each unmatched slot and follow the BFS to find all
augmenting paths that end on unmatched candidates. We need
𝑂(𝑐𝑠2)time per ranking step, and in total only 𝑂(𝑘𝑛𝑐𝑠2)time. We
also note that on each ranking step each Monte-Carlo estimate 𝑅𝑖
is independent and with perfect parallelism, we could eliminate the
dependency over 𝑛to get𝑂(𝑘𝑐𝑠2)time complexity.
A further improvement in runtime can be achieved by exploiting
that MatchRank is a greedy algorithm for maximizing a submodular
objective. For any such algorithm, we can use lazy evaluation [ 23] to
accelerate the ranking process in practice1. Lazy greedy maintains
a priority queue of stale marginal gains to reduce unnecessary
computation of marginal gains for many examples per step. Since
marginal gains can never increase due to the submodularity of the
objective, the stale marginal gains provide an upper bound on the
improvement. Thus, if a stale marginal gain is not large enough
to propose a candidate as a greedy maximizer, then recomputing
its marginal gain is not necessary. This is particularly effective in
our matching scenarios, since many candidates are not relevant
for some slots. This means they will have small marginal gains
even in the first step of ranking, and we can significantly reduce
computation of their marginal gains during subsequent iterations
when using lazy greedy.
Finally, we could replace the greedy algorithm with some approx-
imate version of greedy that is substantially faster, such as stochastic
greedy [ 24] and threshold greedy [ 6] for monotone submodular
maximization problem. We have performed initial evaluations of
these methods with promising results, but did not find a need for
them for our experiments. Generally, we found the exact greedy
algorithm to be tractable for datasets with up to 50,000 candidates.
Note that the√.term approaches zero as we increase the number
𝑛of sampled relevance matrices. This means that for large Monte-
Carlo samples, the approximation factor approaches 1−1/𝑒, where
𝑒is Euler’s number.
The monotone submodularity of ˆ𝑀(𝑋)opens a large arsenal of
submodular optimization methods for constructing candidate sets
𝑋𝑘with provable approximation guarantees. We opt for the greedy
algorithm, since it naturally constructs a ranking.
1We run all of our experiments with lazy greedy.4 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
We now evaluate the MatchRank algorithm on three types of data.
The first is fully synthetic data, where we can control all aspects of
the ranking problems to understand the conditions under which
MatchRank improves over baseline heuristics. Second, we evalu-
ate MatchRank on a number of benchmark datasets. And finally,
we verify the applicability of MatchRank on a real-world college-
admissions problem. We provide software for reproducing the em-
pirical results and to enable followup work on MatchRank2.
Evaluation Process and Metric. For each problem, our evaluation
follows the process depicted in Figure 2. We first use a training set
to learn a model — usually a calibrated regression model – which we
can use to infer the relevance probabilities ˆ𝑃(𝑅)for the candidates
in the test set. We apply MatchRank and other baseline rankers to
rank this test set, which only requires sampling from ˆ𝑃(𝑅).
To evaluate any ranking 𝜎, we use the following process and
metric. For each top- 𝑘prefix𝜎𝑘of𝜎, we reveal the ground-truth
relevance labels 𝑅of these𝑘candidates and compute how many
slots can be filled when optimally matching these 𝑘candidates to
the slots. This is precisely the size of the matching 𝑀𝐵𝑀(𝜎𝑘,S|𝑅).
Our final evaluation metric for 𝜎is the smallest 𝑘for which the
prefix𝜎𝑘fills all|S|slots with relevant candidates.
𝑘min=argmin
𝑘∈[𝑐]{𝑀𝐵𝑀(𝜎𝑘,S|𝑅)=|S|} (5)
This means that 𝑘minis the number of candidates in 𝜎that need to
be reviewed before all slots are filled.
Since𝑘minscales with the total number of slots, we report the
normalized 𝑘min/|S|, so that the best possible score is 1.
Baseline Rankers. We compare MatchRank against the following
baselines rankers. These methods compute a score for each candi-
date, and then rank by this score. The baseline rankers differ by
how they aggregate the estimated marginal relevance probabilities
ˆ𝑃(𝑅𝐶,𝑆)(estimated from the Monte-Carlo samples) for each can-
didate𝐶across all slots 𝑆. The first heuristic is motivated by the
softAND ruleÎ
𝑆∈Sˆ𝑃(𝑅𝐶,𝑆). The second uses the soft ORrule
1−Î
𝑆∈S(1−ˆ𝑃(𝑅𝐶,𝑆)). Both the AND and the ORrule skip probabil-
ities that are zero when computing the product. The third heuristic,
called Total Relevance (TR) merely sums the relevance probabilitiesÍ
𝑆∈Sˆ𝑃(𝑅𝐶,𝑆)across all slots. The final heuristic is a normalized
version of the total relevances, called NTR, that normalizes with
the competition for each slot (number of relevant candidates for

We use the same sampled relevance matrices R=[𝑅1,...,𝑅𝑛]as
what we use for MatchRank when computing the ranking shortlist
for TR and NTR. Note that the conventional diversification methods
we discussed in the related work section cannot handle relevance
signals that are multivariate vectors to optimize the number of filled
slots, and thus an empirical comparison is not sensible.
4.1 Synthetic Datasets
We first focus on a synthetic dataset where we can control the
structure of 𝑃(𝑅), so that we can investigate all problem dimensions
that affect the MatchRank algorithm. Furthermore, we can directly
use𝑃(𝑅)instead of ˆ𝑃(𝑅), which avoids confounding the algorithm’s
behavior with potential inaccuracies in a learned ˆ𝑃(𝑅).
Experiment Setup. To construct synthetic 𝑃(𝑅), we define𝑔groups
(default𝑔=10) and each group has 𝑠slots (default 𝑠=50). We
then create 10,000 candidates, where each candidate is randomly
assigned to 𝑎groups (default 𝑎=2). If candidate 𝐶is a member
of group𝑗∈{1,...,𝑔}, we first sample 𝑝from the Gaussian distri-
butionN(𝑝base+0.03∗𝑗,0.1)with default 𝑝baseas 0.3, and clip 𝑝
to the range of (0.0001, 0.9999). We then sample from a Bernoulli
distribution with probability 𝑝, and the success outcome means 𝐶
is relevant for all slots associated with group 𝑗. If candidate 𝐶is not
member of group 𝑗, then𝐶is not relevant for any slots associated
with group 𝑗, or formally 𝑃(𝑅𝐶,𝑆)=0if slot𝑆belongs to group 𝑗.
If not mentioned otherwise, parameters are at their default value.
We draw 200 Monte-Carlo i.i.d. samples R=[𝑅1,...,𝑅 200]as
input to the ranking algorithms. For evaluation, we draw a ground-
truth relevance matrix 𝑅and compute 𝑘min/|S|, repeat this evalua-
tion 1000 times, and report the mean and standard deviation.
Comparing MatchRank against the Baselines. The first column
of Table 1 shows the performance of MatchRank and the baselines
for the default values of the synthetic data generator. MatchRank
achieves a performance of 1.27, which means that on average only
an additional 27% of candidates need to be reviewed beyond the
number of slots. The best heuristic is NTR, which averages 35%.
Most heuristics do worse than random, which requires 69%. The
reason is that the heuristics systematically miss candidates of some
group, such that those slots cannot be filled.
Effects of the Number of Slots Per Group. We now vary the number
of slots per group from the default of 50 to 30 and 70. The resultsfor 30 and 70 are in the third main column of Table 1, while the
results for 50 are in the default column. All other parameters are
at their default values. MatchRank again show stable performance
over all three settings and dominates most baselines. Only NTR
comes close for larger numbers of slots.
Effects of Number of Group Memberships. We now assign each
candidate to be a member of 1, 2 (default) and 3 groups respec-
tively. All other parameters are at their default. The fourth main
column of Table 1 shows that the problem becomes easier for all
methods, when each candidate can be in more groups. We see that
the advantage of MatchRank is greater for harder problems.
Effect of Number of Monte-Carlo Samples. We now investigate
how important the number 𝑛of Monte-Carlo samples Ris, as we
vary𝑛among 100, 200 (default), and 1000. The results can be found
in the fifth main column of Table 1. We find that MatchRank already
performs well for 𝑛=100, although having larger samples still
improve the results. A larger 𝑛may be even more important for
𝑃(𝑅)with stronger dependencies between candidates and slots.
Effect of Overall Relevance Level. We now vary the overall proba-
bility of relevance. In our model, this is controlled by the parameter
𝑝base, and the higher 𝑝basethe greater the overall probability of
relevance. We vary 𝑝basebetween 0.2 (S), 0.3 (default), and 0.4 (L).
The results can be found in the last major column of Table 1. As
𝑝baseincreases, the problem of finding relevant candidates to fill
the slots becomes easier. Both MatchRank and the baselines benefit
from this, but MatchRank maintains a consistent advantage.
Analyzing the Variability of MatchRank. We want to further un-
derstand the variability of 𝑘min/|S| of MatchRank across ground-
truth relevance matrices. So we prepare a histogram of 𝑘min/|S|
for MatchRank evaluating on Rtestin default settings as shown in
Figure 3. This figure demonstrates that the distribution of 𝑘min/|S|
is slightly right-tailed as the sample mean is higher than the sam-
ple median. This could be explained as MatchRank being prone to
overestimating candidates’ probability of relevances. Therefore, it
is likely that some slots are not filled by relevant candidates even
when MatchRank believes all slots have been filled. Such phenom-
enon is illustrated by the fact that there are still 24.9% 𝑅samples
for which slots have not been filled after ΔRbecomes 0 (the purple
line) in the Figure 3.

ΔR=0is the position in the ranking when all slots in the
Monte-CarloRsamples are filled and the marginal gain of

Analyzing the Robustness of MatchRank to ˆ𝑃(𝑅)Misspecification.
We now investigate how robust MatchRank is against an inaccu-
rately learned ˆ𝑃(𝑅). We draw the ground-truth relevance labels
from a model 𝑃(𝑅)with𝑝base=0.3(Ref), but draw the Monte-
Carlo samples from misspecified models ˆ𝑃(𝑅)with𝑝baseset to 0.1
(XS), 0.2 (S), 0.4 (L), and 0.5 (XL). Figure 4 shows that MatchRank
performs best for the correctly specified ˆ𝑃(𝑅)as expected. Among
the misspecified ˆ𝑃(𝑅), we can observe that MatchRank is more
vulnerable to overestimation of relevance probabilities than un-
derestimation. This can be explained as follows. If MatchRank is
erroneously convinced that a slot is filled with high probability, it
will not add an alternative candidate for this slot to the ranking.
This fact is illustrated in the middle subfigure of Figure 4, where

correct model. The left subfigure shows mean and standard
deviation of 𝑘min/|S|.
MatchRank fills all slots in the Monte-Carlo Rsamples faster as the
overall relevance level increases. However, the average number of
filled slots using the ground-truth relevances 𝑅is not necessarily
higher, and in fact both L and XL have fewer filled slots per ranking
step than S and XS for 𝑅. So it may be advisable to clip ˆ𝑃(𝑅)to
a maximum value that is well below 1 to increase robustness to
misspecification.
4.2 Real-World Benchmark Datasets
We now evaluate MatchRank on six benchmark datasets, where
we now learn the relevance model ˆ𝑃(𝑅)from training data. These
benchmark datasets are constructed from the multi-label datasets
Medical [ 26], Bibtex [ 20], Delicious [ 39], TMC2007 [ 35], Mediamill
[34], and Bookmarks [ 20] from the Mulan data repository [ 40]. Our
data source is the scikit-multilearn library [37].
 
962KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Wentao Guo∗, Andrew Wang∗, Bradon Thymes, and Thorsten Joachims
Experiment Setup. Each dataset comes with a train/test split. We
consider each example in test set as a candidate, and each label
as a group. We first select 10 labels that cover different numbers
of relevant candidates (the specific label choices are included in
Table 4 in Appendix B), and then allocate a certain number of slots
for each label. We train ˆ𝑃(𝑅)on the training set using a calibrated
binary logistic regression for each label. For the Medical, Bibtex,
Delicious, Mediamill, and Bookmarks dataset, we use Platt scaling
method [ 27] to calibrate the probabilistic predictions while for the
TMC2007 dataset, we use isotonic regression. To raise the noise in
the relevance prediction to a more challenging and realistic level, we
mask 20% of the label in both the train and test set. We then draw 100
Monte-Carlo samples from ˆ𝑃(𝑅)as input to the ranking algorithm.
All rankers are evaluated against the true masked relevance labels
in the test set, meaning that a test example matches a slot if it
contains the corresponding label.
Results. The result are shown in Table 2. For all benchmark
datasets and all numbers of slots per label, MatchRank delivers the
best ranking performance in terms of 𝑘min/|S|. The most competi-
tive heuristic ranker is NTR, but the results show that its heuristic
can fail on some datasets and provide substantially worse rank-
ing performance than MatchRank (e.g. Bookmarks). These results
demonstrate that MatchRank performs robustly over a wide range
of datasets where the ˆ𝑃(𝑅)is learned from training data.
Analysis. To provide additional insights into the behavior of
MatchRank in comparison to the heuristic rankers, Figure 5 shows
their behavior on each dataset with medium amount of slots per
label. On each subfigure, left panels show the average number of
filled slots over the Monte-Carlo samples as the shortlist size 𝑘
grows. Across all datasets, MatchRank finds a close to optimal rank-
ing while all heuristics require a substantially longer shortlist. This
indicates that the heuristics optimize a fundamentally wrong objec-
tive. Right panels of each subfigure in Figure 5 show the number
of filled slots when using the ground-truth labels for matching.
These plots generally show a gap between MatchRank and the
optimal ranking one can compute from the ground-truth labels.
Since MatchRank performs close to optimal on the Monte-Carlo
samples, this gap can be attributed to the inherent inaccuracy and
uncertainty of ˆ𝑃(𝑅)in predicting the ground-truth relevance. This
suggests that MatchRank performs close to optimal in terms of its
optimization performance, and that the remaining suboptimality is
largely a result of an imperfect ˆ𝑃(𝑅).
4.3 College Admission Dataset
To verify the effectiveness of MatchRank under real-world condi-
tions, we consider an anonymized undergraduate admission dataset
from a selective US university. The groups in this datasets are ma-
jors, and we posit that each major has only a fixed number of slots
for admitting qualified students. We consider all majors that ad-
mitted at least 50 students, which leaves us with 13 majors and
19421 applicants in the test set. On the admission decisions from
the prior year we train a boosted tree model with XGBoost [ 11]
using a logistic loss objective and L2-regularization. This model is
used to predict each applicant’s probability of being admitted, and
we clip the maximum ˆ𝑃(𝑅)by 0.3. Applicants can indicate theirTable 3: College Admission: Performance of MatchRank in
comparison to heuristics in terms of 𝑘min/|S|. For each trial,
we repeat for 3 random seeds and report the mean and stan-
dard deviation of 𝑘min/|S|in the format of “mean std”.

interests in majors, and the probability of admission to a major that
the applicant did not indicate interest in is set to zero. This provides
us with ˆ𝑃(𝑅)for all test applicants.
We create 100 Monte-Carlo sampled relevance matrices from this
ˆ𝑃(𝑅)as input to all ranking algorithms. To set the number of avail-
able slots for each member, we use min(⌊0.7∗|relevant applicants
for this major|⌋,𝑠max)to get an interesting relationship between
supply and demand, and we vary 𝑠maxin the following experiments.
We then run our ranking algorithms, and during evaluation we
reveal the applicants ground-truth admissions decisions (i.e. the
true relevance matrix 𝑅) for each candidate. To evaluate, we again
find the minimum shortlist size 𝑘for each algorithm at which all
slots are filled with relevant applicants.
The results are provided in Table 3. This dataset is substantially
more challenging for all methods, as the density of relevant candi-
dates is small and we need to find a larger fraction of the relevant
candidates to fill all slots. However, even in this challenging setting,
we see that MatchRank is more effective than the heuristic base-
lines. This holds particularly when the number of slots per major
is smaller, as the performance gap between MatchRank and other
heuristic algorithms becomes larger. For larger 𝑠maxthe majority of
relevant candidates need to be found, such that even a small degree
of inaccuracy in ˆ𝑃(𝑅)can have large impact.
5 EXTENSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Instead of binary relevances as assumed in this paper, some ap-
plications may require real-valued relevances (e.g., star-ratings)
where the decision maker aims to maximize the sum of relevances
under slot constraints. In this setting, the optimal solution is given
by the Maximum Weight Bipartite Matching 𝑀𝑊𝐵𝑀(𝑋,S|𝑅)for
the weighted biadjacency matrix 𝑅. If the MWBM objective is
also monotone submodular3, we could simply replace the MBM in
MatchRankwith the MWBM and provide a similar approximation
guarantee for this weighted version of MatchRank.
Another extension is the use of high-dimensional matching in-
stead of the bipartite matching considered in this paper. This could
model slot constraints over more than one category. For example,
college admission may have slot constraints not only for majors but
also for extracurricular teams (e.g., orchestra, athletics). Since slots
for majors are orthogonal to the slots for extracurricular teams, this
3We find a submodularity proof for maximum generalized flow problem in Fleis-
cher [15], and we would refer readers to that paper as such discussion is beyond the
scope of this paper.

corresponds to a three-dimensional matching (3-DM) problem. The
3-DM problem is NP-hard and even APX-hard [ 18], and the best
approximation algorithm so far achieves an error bound of (4/3 +
𝜖) [12]. In general, Hazan et al . [18] show that all 𝑑-DM (𝑑≥3)
problems cannot be approximated within a factor of 𝑂(𝑑/ln𝑑)un-
less P = NP. But even if this matching problem cannot be solved
exactly any more, the approximate solutions could give rise to an
approximate ranking algorithm analogous to MatchRank.
6 CONCLUSION
We introduce the problem of ranking under slot constraints, which
allows practitioners to specify conditions that arise in a wide va-
riety of applications. To solve this ranking problem, we develop
the MatchRank algorithm and show that it provides a theoretical
guarantee on its ranking performance. A key insight is that the
ranking objective can be related to the maximum bipartite matching
problem, and that it is monotone submodular. We also show how
MatchRank can be implemented efficiently so that it can efficiently
handle real-world ranking problems of substantial size. Beyond itstheoretical guarantees, MatchRank shows superior ranking perfor-
mance across extensive experiments compared to several heuristic
baselines. This holds across a wide range of datasets and experiment
conditions, and MatchRank shows robustness to sample size and
misspecified relevance distributions. We conclude that the ability
to model complex problems and provide accurate rankings across a
wide range of domains, backed by theoretical guarantees, makes
the slot constraint framework a promising paradigm for tackling
complex real-world ranking problems.

In Section A we will provide a proof of Theorem 3.1. In Sec-
tion B, we report the selected labels in our real-world benchmark
experiments.
A PROOF OF THEOREM 3.1
The first step in proving Theorem 3.1 is to prove that the maximum
bipartite matching is monotone submodular.
Lemma A.1. For any relevance matrix 𝑅and any set of slotsS, the
size of the maximum bipartite matching is monotone in 𝑋
∀𝑋⊆C,∀𝐶∈C:MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶},S|𝑅)≥MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅) (6)
and also submodular in 𝑋, which means that ∀𝑋⊆C,∀𝐶,𝐶′∈C
MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶},S|𝑅)−MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅)
≥MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′},S|𝑅)−MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶′},S|𝑅).
Proof. By a matchingMfrom𝑋toS, we refer to a set of
candidate-slot pairs M⊂𝑋×S such that all pairs are relevant
(𝑅𝑐𝑠=1for all(𝑐,𝑠)∈M ) and no candidate or slot appears in more
than one pair inM. We call a matching Mfrom𝑋toSmaximum
if|M| is maximized over all matchings from 𝑋toS.
For monotonicity, we know that every single matching from 𝑋
toSis also a possible matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶}toS, thus the size
of the maximum matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶}toSmust be at least the
size of the maximum matching from 𝑋toS. So Equation 6 holds.
For submodularity, if we denote
𝑀0=MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅) (7)
𝑀1=MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶},S|𝑅) (8)
𝑀2=MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶′},S|𝑅) (9)
𝑀12=MBM(𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′},S|𝑅) (10)
We want to show that
𝑀1−𝑀0≥𝑀12−𝑀2. (11)
Let us denote 𝑀1−𝑀0as the LHS and 𝑀12−𝑀2as the RHS
for Equation (11). Equation (6)says both the LHS and RHS are
nonnegative. Additionally, the LHS is upper bounded by 1, as given
any matchingMof size𝑀1from𝑋∪{𝐶}toS, we can construct
a matchingM′from𝑋toSof size at least 𝑀1−1by removing
the unique pair involving 𝐶fromM, if it exists, which shows
𝑀0≥|M′|≥𝑀1−1. By the same reasoning, the RHS is upper
bounded by 1, and indeed we also have 0≤𝑀2−𝑀0≤1. Then
since both the LHS and RHS can only take on values 0or1, in order
to prove equation (11)it suffices to show that if the RHS equals 1,
then the LHS equals 1.
Assume the RHS equals 1. Then any maximum matching M
from𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′}toSmust include a pair (𝐶,𝑆)for some𝑆∈S, or
elseMwould also be a valid matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶′}toS, which
would imply that 𝑀2≥|M| =𝑀12, violating the assumption. We
split on two cases, which as we noted earlier are exhaustive.
Case :𝑀2−𝑀0=0. LetM0be some maximum matchings from
𝑋toS. Since𝑀2=𝑀0by assumption,M0is also a maximum
matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶′}toS. Indeed,M0is also a matching
from𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′}toS, but not a maximum matching, as 𝑀12>
𝑀2by assumption. Therefore, by Berge’s theorem, there must
exist an “augmenting path” 𝑃consisting of candidate-slot pairs(𝑐1,𝑠1),...,(𝑐𝑇,𝑠𝑇) ∈ (𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′})×S for all𝑡such that all
pairs are relevant, i.e. 𝑅𝑐𝑡,𝑠𝑡=1for all𝑡, and the path starts and
ends on unmatched edges and alternates between matched and
unmatched edges, i.e. (𝑐𝑡,𝑠𝑡)∉M0for all𝑡and(𝑐𝑡,𝑠𝑡−1)∈M 0for
all𝑡∈{2,...,𝑇}. But then since 𝑃contains one more unmatched
than matched edge, “applying” 𝑃toM0via the set difference op-
eration gives a maximum matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′}toS, since
M:=(M0\𝑃)∪(𝑃\M 0)satisfies|M|=𝑀0+1=𝑀2+1=𝑀12.
But sinceMis a maximum matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′}toS, we
must have thatMcontains candidate 𝐶as shown earlier, thus it
cannot contain 𝐶′by the alternating edges property of 𝑃as both𝐶
and𝐶′are unmatched inM0. But thenMis a valid matching from
𝑋∪{𝐶}toS, hence𝑀1≥|M| =𝑀12=𝑀0+1as desired.
Case :𝑀2−𝑀0=1. LetMbe a maximum matching from 𝑋∪
{𝐶,𝐶′}toS; then we must have |M|=𝑀12=𝑀0+2by assumption.
If candidate 𝐶′does not appear in M, thenMis a valid matching
from𝑋∪{𝐶}toS, so𝑀1≥|M| =𝑀2+1≥𝑀0+1and we are done.
Otherwise, assume Mincludes a pair(𝐶′,𝑆′)for some𝑆′∈S. But
thenM′′:=M\{(𝐶′,𝑆′)}is a valid matching from 𝑋∪{𝐶}toS
with|M′′|=𝑀12−1=𝑀0+1, hence𝑀1≥𝑀0+1as desired.
□
The monotone submodularity of MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅)implies that our
estimate ˆ𝑀(𝑋)is also monotone submodular, since this property is
closed under addition.
Lemma A.2. For any sample of relevance matrices R=[𝑅1,...,𝑅𝑛]
and set of slotsS,ˆ𝑀(𝑋)from Equation (4)is monotone in 𝑋
∀𝑋⊆C,∀𝐶∈C :ˆ𝑀(𝑋∪{𝐶})≥ ˆ𝑀(𝑋)
and also submodular in 𝑋, which means that ∀𝑋⊆C,∀𝐶,𝐶′∈C
ˆ𝑀(𝑋∪{𝐶})− ˆ𝑀(𝑋)≥ ˆ𝑀(𝑋∪{𝐶,𝐶′})− ˆ𝑀(𝑋∪{𝐶′}).
Proof. We know from Lemma A.1 that each each MBM(𝑋,S|𝑅𝑖)
is monotone and submodular. This means that ˆ𝑀(𝑋)is a sum of
monotone submodular function, and it is well known that sum is
monotone submodular as well. □
We are now in a position to complete the proof of Theorem 3.1.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Our goal is to bound with high proba-
bility the suboptimality 𝑀(𝑋𝑘)−𝑀(𝑋∗
𝑘)between the candidate set
𝑋𝑘output by the model and the optimal candidate set 𝑋∗
𝑘.
First, note that the approximation guarantee of the greedy algo-
rithm for monotone submodular maximization with a cardinality
constraint [25] guarantees
ˆ𝑀(𝑋𝑘)≥( 1−1/𝑒)ˆ𝑀(ˆ𝑋∗
𝑘)≥( 1−1/𝑒)ˆ𝑀(𝑋∗
𝑘), (12)
where ˆ𝑋∗
𝑘=argmax|𝑋|=𝑘ˆ𝑀(𝑋)is the optimal set on the Monte-
Carlo samples. The second inequality follows from ˆ𝑀(𝑋∗
𝑘)≤ ˆ𝑀(ˆ𝑋∗
𝑘).
To get a bound in terms of 𝑀(.)instead of ˆ𝑀(.), we need to
bound the error due to Monte-Carlo sampling. We start with the
following equivalent expansion of Equation (12).

𝑃(𝑀(𝑋)− ˆ𝑀(𝑋)>𝜖)≤exp(−2𝑛𝜖2/𝑠2).
We thus get for our particular 𝑋∗

Second, we need to upper bound 𝑀(𝑋𝑘)− ˆ𝑀(𝑋𝑘). Since𝑋𝑘is
selected on the same Monte-Carlo sample we evaluate it on, we
need to ensure uniform convergence over all 𝑋. We thus take the
union bound over the set H𝑘of all possible candidate sets of size 𝑘:

The second step uses Stirling’s inequality, since |H𝑘|=𝑘!. By
letting the final expression equal 𝛿2and solving for 𝜖, we get that
with probability 0≤𝛿2≤1/2it holds for all 𝑋(and therefore also
for any𝑋𝑘our algorithm picks) that
𝑀(𝑋𝑘)− ˆ𝑀(𝑋𝑘)≤𝑠√︃

2𝑛:=𝜖2.
Putting these bounds together, we get that for all 0<𝛿1,𝛿2<1/2,

B SELECTED LABELS IN REAL-WORLD
BENCHMARK EXPERIMENTS
We report the selected labels for our real-world benchmark experi-
ments in Table 4. We pick these labels with a consideration of both
prediction precision (these labels are not hard to predict by logistic
regression models) and sufficient competition among candidates
(the positive occurrences of these labels should be larger than the
number of slots). We do not change the selected labels when we
change the number of slots per label in Table 2.
