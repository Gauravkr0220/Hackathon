ABSTRACT
Existing neural constructive solvers for routing problems have pre-
dominantly employed transformer architectures, conceptualizing
the route construction as a set-to-sequence learning task. However,
their efficacy has primarily been demonstrated on entirely random
problem instances that inadequately capture real-world scenarios.
In this paper, we introduce realistic Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) scenarios relevant to industrial settings and derive the fol-
lowing insights: (1) The optimal next node (or city) to visit often
lies within proximity to the current node, suggesting the potential
benefits of biasing choices based on current locations. (2) Effectively
solving the TSP requires robust tracking of unvisited nodes and
warrants succinct grouping strategies. Building upon these insights,
we propose integrating a learnable choice layer inspired by Hy-
pernetworks to prioritize choices based on the current location,
and a learnable approximate clustering algorithm inspired by the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm to facilitate grouping the un-
visited cities. Together, these two contributions form a hierarchical
approach towards solving the realistic TSP by considering both
immediate local neighbourhoods and learning an intermediate set
of node representations. Our hierarchical approach yields superior
performance compared to both classical and recent transformer
models, showcasing the efficacy of the key designs.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem. Simply put, the TSP asks the following: given
a set of cities, what is the shortest route where a salesman can visit
every city only once and return back to his starting city? While
it is simple to state, the TSP is a very difficult problem known to
be NP-hard. Nevertheless, the TSP is a crucial problem to study, as
many parallel problems can be reduced to solving the TSP, such as
chip placement [ 20], the study of spin glass problems in physics
[17], DNA sequencing [4], and many others.
Given its prevalence across a multitude of domains, the TSP
has been extensively researched in the community. Particularly,
the main approaches can be broken down into exact methods and
approximate methods. Exact methods often materialize in the form
of mathematical programming. Some popular exact solvers, such
as Concorde [ 2], are developed based on linear programming and
cutting planes. Approximate methods tend to be in the form of ex-
pert heuristics. An example would be the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun
(LKH-3) algorithm, which utilizes heuristics and local search meth-
ods to update and improve initial solutions. As their names describe,
exact methods return the true optimal routes while approximate
ones return solutions often within some error bound of the op-
timal one. As the size of the problems grows, exact methods are
intractable due to the NP-hard nature of the problem.
More recently, the deep learning community has put much effort
into establishing practical neural solvers. These typically appear in
the form of deep reinforcement learning [ 3,10,15,19,21], which
presents a label-free approach to improve the models. This is pre-
ferred over supervised learning approaches (e.g, [ 14,28]) since they
require large amounts of labelled data, which is often challenging
to obtain given the limited scalability of exact solvers.
It is important to note that learning-based solvers may perform
well on specific target distributions they are trained on, but often
suffer from poor generalization to other arbitrary instances. This

most plots show the base distribution. The subsets follow

is acceptable if the target distributions reflect real-world cases.
However, prior works have mostly only been trained and tested
on problems derived from random synthetic distributions, which
may not accurately represent real-world applications. While some
learned solvers have been tested on realistic TSP instances, such as
those from the TSPLIB [ 27], a collection of TSP instances observed
in the real world, these realistic problem collections are typically
too small to train on. Therefore, there is a gap in studying the
performance of learning-based solvers in more realistic scenarios
from the real world.
In this paper, we propose and study a setup that closely mirrors
practical scenarios. Consider a logistic company with a large set
of𝑀fixed locations that it can deliver to. The company will do
many delivery trips to these locations but for each trip, only a small
subset𝑉of the𝑀locations, e.g., locations that placed orders for that
day, need to be visited. This observation motivates us to generate
realistic distributions as follows: select a set of 𝑀fixed locations
from the real world to reflect real-world location distributions, and
build each problem instance by randomly sampling a subset of 𝑉
locations from the set of 𝑀locations.
We construct the locations using real-world datasets of cities
from the USA, Japan, and Burma. When state-of-the-art neural
solvers are trained in realistic settings, their performance may not
be satisfactory. To improve the neural solvers, we focus on exploit-
ing the nature of the node construction process. Existing neural
solvers typically construct TSP tours autoregressively, solving the
problem of visiting all unvisited cities starting from the current city
and returning to the starting city. This suggests learning more effec-
tive and generalizable representations of the decision information
regarding the current city and unvisited cities.
Specifically, we first observe that neural solvers often struggle to
select a proper next city in the neighbourhood of the current city
in our proposed realistic setup. This highlights the importance ofexploiting more effective decision information about the current
city. To this end, we propose to incorporate a customized hypernet-
work layer [ 11] that leverages the embedding of the current city to
modify the choice of the next city to visit.
Moreover, to obtain an improved representation of unvisited
cities, we design a hierarchical representation that divides the cities
into𝐶partitions and use an embedding to represent the unvisited
cities in each of the 𝐶partitions. We perform the partitioning using
a soft clustering method, inspired by the EM algorithm. Given
its differentiable property of EM, we can propagate the gradient
through the clustering to learn the encoder parameters effectively.
We showcase the effectiveness of the hypernetwork and the hier-
archical representation of unvisited cities in experiments with the
proposed realistic setting. We highlight the following contributions:
•We introduce a more realistic TSP setting using real-world
data to more convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of
neural TSP solvers.
•We make the key observation that neural solvers often strug-
gle with node selection within a small locality, and we design
a hypernetwork layer to emphasize local choices.
•We further exploit the nature of solving structured TSPs by
representing the set of unvisited cities with multiple key
embeddings using a differentiable soft clustering algorithm
instead of conventional simplistic pooling methods.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Constructive Neural Solvers
Deep reinforcement learning forms the hallmark of training con-
structive neural solvers. Early works from [ 3] proposed to use the
Pointer Network [ 32] based on the sequence-to-sequence architec-
ture in [ 29] to solve TSP and Knapsack problems. They employ
an actor-critic approach and achieved strong results on the TSP.
Follow-up works from [ 26] further improve the performance of the
Pointer Network.
Following on from this, the transformer network based on atten-
tion [ 31] was proposed by [ 19] to solve the TSP, Capacited Vehicle
Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP). Pri-
marily, the work showed that one can train a neural solver using the
REINFORCE algorithm [ 33] and a simple greedy rollout of the net-
work with a lagging baseline. Since then, multiple works based on
the same architecture have been proposed to improve the predictive
power of such solvers further [ 36]. POMO [ 21] was introduced and
observed that constructive solvers were limited by their starting
nodes. Hence, to effectively explore the search space of solutions,
one should use all nodes as starting nodes, effectively constructing
a simple beam search. Additionally, they showed that a stable base-
line can be found in the average of all solutions. Sym-NCO [ 15] was
proposed to exploit the symmetry of TSP by introducing symmetry
losses to regularize the transformer network. Recently, ELG was
introduced by [ 10] that defined a local learnable policy based on a
k-Nearest Neighbor graph. They exemplified the generalizability
of the network on large CVRP instances.
2.2 Improvement Neural Solvers
Apart from constructive methods, another approach to solving the
TSP looks at improvement solvers. This methodology is inspired

Figure 2: POMO model making a minor mistake with a poor
selection of a local node
by algorithms such as 2-opt, whereby the solver first starts with a
complete route, and a heuristic is then used to select edges to delete
or add so as to edit the solution. Such methods are measured based
on how quickly they can reach a strong solution. Work such as [ 7]
uses neural networks to learn the 2-opt heuristic for improvement,
while [ 34] uses the transformer to select node pairs for swaps for
the TSP. Ma et al. [ 24] then extended the transformer network to
learn node and edge embeddings separately, which is then upgraded
for pickup and delivery problems in [ 23] and flexible k-opt in [ 22],
pushing the iterative solver’s performance further.
2.3 Search-based techniques
The previous two approaches are based on some form of learning-
based search: constructive solvers try to perform a global search
by learning heuristics entirely from data, whereas iterative solvers
learn to guide local search techniques instead. Besides these, there
is a class of search-based techniques that involve applying search
during inference. Efficient Active Search (EAS) was proposed by
[12] to introduce lightweight learnable layers at inference that
could be tuned to improve the predictive power of a model on test
samples. Other works such as [ 9] showcase that one can leverage a
small pre-trained network and combine it with search techniques
such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [ 5] so as to solve large-
scale TSPs. The work in [ 6] then combined both MCTS and EAS to
improve the search capabilities further. Lastly, another work [ 18]
showcased how one could combine dynamic programming with a
pre-trained neural network to scale the TSP to 10,000 nodes.
Previous works attempt to regularize the networks via symmetry
or scale the solver to larger problems. However, they essentially are
still based on transformer models trained on arbitrary distributions.
Apart from ELG, these works do not consider the impact of local
choices nor explore further how to represent unvisited cities better,
which are critical aspects of solving the TSP in our view.
3 OUR APPROACH
Generally, we find that neural solvers tend to make two classes of
errors in route construction compared to the optimal solution for
such practical scenarios. The first class often appears as a minor
error, where a poor decision is made in a local neighbourhood, as
shown in Figure 2. This results in a sub-optimal route because a
local choice is not picked first. The second class tends to appear
Figure 3: POMO model making a major mistake by not visit-
ing nodes that are near it, causing cross-cluster routes that
are inefficient
in problems with more structure, where the agent fails to visit all
reasonable nodes within a local cluster and has to backtrack to the
area, exemplified in Figure 3. This tends to give solutions that are
significantly poorer than optimal.
Our approach seeks to tackle these two errors more effectively.
We propose two main architectural improvements to the base trans-
former model to address these issues. Firstly, we propose a learnable
local choice decoder that accentuates certain choices based on the
agent’s current location (and hence locality). Secondly, we propose
a differentiable clustering algorithm to learn a set of representa-
tions to capture and summarize the set of remaining cities. Our full
approach is illustrated in Figure 4.
3.1 Recap: Constructive Neural Solvers
In this subsection, we review previous works in well-known con-
structive neural solvers such as the attention model [ 19] and the
POMO model [ 21]. The problem can be defined as an instance 𝑠on
a fully connected graph of 𝑛nodes, where each node represents
a city. Each node 𝑛𝑖where𝑖∈{1,...,𝑛}has features 𝑥𝑖, typically
the 2D coordinate. A solution is defined as a TSP tour, and is stated
as a permutation of the nodes given by 𝜏=(𝜏1,...,𝜏𝑛), such that
𝜏𝑡∈{1,...,𝑛}. Note that since the tour does not allow backtracking,
𝜏𝑡≠𝜏𝑡′,∀𝑡≠𝑡′. The formulation yields the following policy:
𝑝𝜃(𝜏|𝑠)=𝑛Ö
𝑡=1𝑝𝜃(𝜏𝑡|𝑠,𝜏1:𝑡−1) (1)
Since the model is trained via reinforcement learning, the policy’s
action thus refers to the selection of the next node 𝜏𝑡given the
current state. The entire policy 𝑝𝜃is parameterized with a neural
network which involves both an encoder and a decoder. The encoder
is a standard transformer model represented as such
˜h𝑖=LN𝑙(h𝑙−1
𝑖+MHA𝑙
𝑖(ℎ𝑙−1
1,...,ℎ𝑙−1
𝑛)) (2)
h𝑙
𝑖=LN𝑙(˜hi+FF(˜hi)) (3)
whereℎ𝑙
𝑖is the embedding of the 𝑖-th node at the 𝑙-th layer,𝑑
the dimension size of the embeddings, MHA is the standard multi-
headed attention layer [ 31],LNis a layer normalization function,
andFFis a simple feed-forward multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Each
node’s embeddings go through a total of 𝐿-layers before being
passed into a decoder.
 
886KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yong Liang Goh et al.
Figure 4: Overview of our proposed architecture. Given a TSP instance, we learn contextual embeddings of the cities in a set of
cluster representations with an EM-inspired differentiable technique. In addition, our policy is dynamically adapted with a
local hypernetwork which emphasises the completion of local cluster before moving on to new distant cities.
For the decoder, the solution is produced in an autoregressive
fashion. In this case, at time step 𝑡, the decoder receives the follow-
ing
h(𝑐)=h𝐿
last+h𝐿
start (4)
where h(𝑐)is known as a contextual embedding. In this instance, the
context given is the sum of the 𝐿-th encoder layer’s representation
of the current node and the starting node. This is then first passed
through a multi-headed attention layer where visited nodes are
masked, followed by a single-headed attention layer for decision-
making. In this decision layer, we obtain the following
𝑄=𝑊𝑄(𝐻),𝐾=𝑊𝐾(𝐻),𝑉=𝑊𝑉(𝐻) (5)
where𝐻is the set of all node embedding after the decoder’s multi-
headed attention layer. With this, we compute the compatibility
of the query with all nodes together with a mask, where the mask
indicates previously visited nodes. This ensures that the decoder
cannot pick an already visited node. Mathematically, we use the
following attention mechanism
𝑎𝑗=(
𝑈·tanh(𝑄𝐾⊤
√
𝑑)𝑗≠𝜏𝑡′,∀𝑡′<𝑡
−∞ otherwise(6)
where we clip the values between [−𝑈,𝑈]using a tanh function
as with works in [ 3,19,21]. These values are then normalized with
a simple softmax function, giving us the following decision-making
policy:
𝑝𝑖=𝑝𝜃(𝜏𝑡=𝑖|𝑠,𝜏1:𝑡−1)=𝑒𝑎𝑗
Í
𝑗𝑒𝑎𝑗(7)
Finally, to train the model, the REINFORCE algorithm [ 33] is
used, where works such as POMO [ 21] and Sym-NCO [ 15] use
a shared baseline of all starting points. Concretely, the expected
return𝐽is maximized with gradient ascent and is approximated by
∇𝜃𝐽(𝜃)≈1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1(𝑅(𝜏𝑖)−𝑏𝑖(𝑠))∇𝜃log𝑝𝜃(𝜏𝑖|𝑠) (8)
where𝑅(𝜏𝑖)is the reward of permutation 𝜏𝑖, the tour length. 𝑝𝜃(𝜏𝑖|𝑠)
=Î𝑇
𝑡=1𝑝𝜃(𝑎𝑖
𝑡|𝑠,𝑎𝑖
1:𝑡−1)is the product of action probabilities for the
trajectory, where actions refer to the selection of the next node to
move to,𝑠refers to the state of the problem, the set of all nodes,current node, and starting node. The baseline is calculated as the
average return of all starting points, given by
𝑏𝑖(𝑠)=𝑏shared(𝑠)=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑗=𝑖𝑅(𝜏𝑗)∀𝑖 (9)
3.2 Improving local decision making with the
Choice Decoder
More often than not, good selections for the TSP tend to lie within
the locality of the current position. In the standard transformer
architecture, the decoder attempts to capture this by using the
current node’s representation in a single-headed attention layer, as
shown in Equations 6 and 7. In fact, Equation 6 is essentially a kernel
function between the current querying node and the candidate
nodes, an observation made in [ 30]. Effectively, we can view the
compatibility score as
𝜙(𝑄,𝐾)=𝑈·tanh(𝑄𝐾⊤
√
𝑑) (10)
Given that we aim to focus more on the current node’s vicin-
ity and features, we propose to generate a set of attention weights
based on the current embeddings. This aims to amplify or nullify
the compatibility scores further by conditioning it on the current
node. Hypernetworks [ 11] are small neural networks designed to
generate a set of weights for a main network. Its goal is to serve as
a form of relaxed weight sharing. This approach allows the hyper-
network to take as input some information about the problem, such
as its structure, and adapt the main network’s weights towards
the problem. Inspired by this approach, we construct the set of
attention weights using an MLP as a hypernetwork, with the input
being the current node’s embedding. Concretely, we modify the
compatibility function as follows:
ˆ𝑎𝑗=𝑈·tanh((𝑄𝑊 choice)𝐾⊤
√
𝑑) (11)
such that
𝑊choice =MLP(𝑄),𝑊choice∈R𝑑𝑥𝑑(12)
Effectively,𝑊choice serves as a set of learnable conditional pa-
rameters that serve to alter the compatibility scores based on cur-
rent embeddings. However, implementing this as a full matrix is
 
887Hierarchical Neural Constructive Solver for Real-world TSP Scenarios KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
extremely expensive. Instead, we realize 𝑊choice as a diagonal ma-
trix, effectively reducing the compatibility score function to
𝜙(𝑄,𝐾|𝑄)=˜𝑎𝑗=𝑈·tanh((𝑄∗𝑊choice)𝐾⊤
√
𝑑) (13)
where∗is the element-wise product. Inherently, 𝑊choice now re-
duces to a set of learnable scalars which serve to modify the compat-
ibility scores between 𝑄and𝐾. Additionally, these learnable scalars
are now conditioned upon 𝑄, the current node, since it is generated
via the MLP. The complexity of the MLP also now reduces from
producing an output of R𝑑×𝑑toR𝑑.
3.3 Exploiting structure with Hierarchical
Decoder
In its current state, the decoder models the TSP as a set-to-sequence
function. A key aspect of the input is the contextual embedding,
h(𝑐). This embedding serves to represent the current state the
model is in and is often a combination of the starting node, current
node, and some global representation of the problem. For the global
representation, works such as [ 19] and [ 21] use an average of all
node embeddings, while others such as [ 13], maintain an average of
all visited nodes so far. Essentially, all of these approaches attempt
to capture various nuances of the TSP.
However, for realistic problem settings, it is important to exploit
the structure of the distribution of the cities. A single global rep-
resentation would not be effective enough to capture the intricate
correlations present between the cities. One notable and ubiqui-
tous case is the presence of cluster patterns wherein certain cities
are located near to each other while being distant to others. This
clustering pattern, if captured within the global and contextual
representation, can potentially provide the model with important
clues to determine the next city to visit. Thus, for such problems,
we propose to maintain a set of 𝐶representations that are able to
summarize the set of unvisited cities left, instead of a simple single
representation. We postulate that this is meaningful as structured
problems have frequent cities in fixed areas of the map, and being
able to identify if a node belongs to a certain area could be beneficial
to the decision-making process.
Prior works in other domains have shown the efficacy of cluster
construction in applications such as node classification [ 8]. In this
work, we wish to group all cities into 𝐶representations. To this
end, we design the following layer inspired by the Expectation-
Maximization (EM) algorithm [25]. We first briefly review the EM
algorithm for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Let 𝜃={𝜋𝑘,𝜇𝑘}
denote the set of parameters, the coefficients of Gaussians 𝜋and
its associated means 𝜇(covariance Σ𝑘is assumed to be known),
X={x(𝑖)}denote the set of data points, and Z={𝑧(𝑖)}denote
the set of latent variables associated with the data. The maximum-
likelihood objective is given by
log𝑝(X|𝜋,𝜇)=𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1log𝐾∑︁
𝑧(𝑖)=1𝑝(x(𝑛)|𝑧(𝑛);𝜇)𝑝(𝑧(𝑛)|𝜋) (14)
In general, Equation 14 yields no closed-form solution. Additionally,
it is non-convex, and its derivatives are expensive to compute. Since
latent variable 𝑧(𝑖)exists for every observation and we have a sum
inside a log, we look at the EM algorithm to solve this. Typically, theEM algorithm involves two steps: the E-step computes the posterior
probability over 𝑧given the current parameters, and the M-step,
which assumes that given that the data was generated with 𝑧(𝑖)=𝑘,
finds the set of parameters that maximizes this. Effectively, for a
standard GMM, this yields the following E-step, given an initial set
of parameters 𝜃:
𝛾𝑘=𝑝(𝑧(𝑖)=𝑘|x(𝑖);𝜃old)=𝜋𝑘N(x|𝜇𝑘)
Í𝐾
𝑗=1𝜋𝑗N(x|𝜇𝑗)(15)
where𝛾𝑘can be viewed as the responsibility of cluster 𝑘towards
data point x(𝑖). Then, for GMMs, the following update equations
can be applied in the M-step:
𝜇𝑘=1
𝑁𝑘𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝛾(𝑖)
𝑘x(𝑖)(16)
𝜋𝑘=𝑁𝑘
𝑁,where𝑁∑︁
𝑖=𝑖𝛾(𝑖)
𝑘(17)
Essentially, Equation 15 estimates the contribution of each Gauss-
ian model given the current set of parameters. While Equations 16
and 17, highlight closed-form update equations for the Gaussian
parameters.
Now, suppose a TSP instance drawn from a fixed map can be
represented efficiently with 𝐶latent representations. Since we are
dealing with subsets of problems from the same space, these 𝐶
representations can be fixed and learnable. Let C∈R𝑁𝑐×𝑑denote
this set of representations, where we have 𝐶={𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑁𝑐}. We
propose to learn and update these representations by considering a
mixture model, where the latent variables are modelled by these
latent embeddings. Similar to the EM algorithm, we produce a set
of mixing coefficients using an attention layer and its attention
weights. Concretely, our soft clustering algorithm estimates its
mixing coefficients via the attention mechanism, and using these
scores, the clusters are then updated with a weighted sum of the
embeddings. This can be shown as
ˆℎ𝑖=𝑊𝐻ℎ𝑖 (18)
ˆ𝑐𝑗=𝑊𝐶𝑐𝑗 (19)
𝜋𝑖,𝑗=softmax(ˆℎ𝑖ˆ𝑐𝑗⊤
√
𝑑) (20)
𝑐𝑗=∑︁
𝑖𝜋𝑖,𝑗ℎ𝑖 (21)
where Πis the matrix containing all coefficients 𝜋𝑖,𝑗,𝑊𝐻and𝑊𝐶are
parameters for the attentional scores, and 𝐶is the set of learnable
embeddings for the distribution. Given a single set of parameters
in the attention layer, the embeddings 𝐻and𝐶are passed through
this same layer a total of 𝐵times iteratively, mimicking a "rollout"
of a soft clustering algorithm of E-steps and M-steps within each
iteration. Loosely, we can see that Equation 20 resembles a similar
calculation of the E-step, wherein we use a set of parameters to
estimate the coefficients instead of minimizing for the Euclidean
distance in the GMM case. Equation 21 is similar to the M-step of
GMMs, where we update the centers (in our case the embeddings
are the latent variables) with a weighted sum of the data.
 
888KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yong Liang Goh et al.
Once we have the set of 𝐶embeddings, we update the represen-
tation at every step of decoding by subtracting a weighted sum of
the current node’s embedding; this computes the weighted sum of
embeddings of unvisited cities, instead of all cities. Thus, at time
step𝑇, if the agent is current at node 𝑖, we update 𝐶via
𝑐′
𝑗=𝑐𝑗−(𝜋𝑖,𝑗∗ℎ𝑖),∀𝑗∈𝑁𝑐 (22)
Then, we now construct a new context embedding such that
h(𝑐)=𝑊combine[ℎ𝐿
last,𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑁𝑐]+h𝐿
first (23)
where[·]is the concatenation operation, and 𝑊combine is a simple
linear layer to combine the embeddings. We keep h𝐿first separate so
as to preserve the importance of the starting node. As the decoder
constructs the solutions, the 𝐶embeddings get updated along the
way, maintaining a small set of unvisited cities so as to keep track
of the solution.

4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
4.1 Data Generation
We present three different benchmarks for comparison. For all sce-
narios, we look at TSP-100 problems. Firstly, we generate random
uniform data on a [0,1]square and a fixed test set of 10,000in-
stances. This is done to show if the addition of other layers interferes
with the base performance of the transformer model.
To generate realistic data, we sample instances from 3 different
countries, available at [ 1] and shown in Figure 5. Namely, they are
•USA13509 - 13,509 cities across the United States of America,
each with a population >500
•BM33708 - 33,708 cities across the country of Burma
•JA9847 - 9,847 cities across the country of Japan
Each country is first normalized to a [0,1]square. Then, at every
training epoch, we randomly sample problems of size 100 from the
map. Naturally, clusters that are denser across the country will be
sampled more frequently. A test set size of 10,000samples is also
drawn and held aside for evaluation. Each test set is fully solved
via Concorde [ 2] to get the optimal length of each tour. We define
1 epoch to be 100,000samples, and the models are trained for 200
epochs to prevent overfitting. In totality, the model sees 20,000,000
different samples. Thirdly, we define a limited data setting. This
mimics a typical practical problem where the company does not
have unlimited access to data. We first define a small dataset of
50,000samples for such a setting. Based on the experiment size,
we sample the necessary amount of data. Likewise, the models are
tested on the same test set of 10,000samples.
Additionally, to show the generality of our approach beyond
the logistics domain, we include the PCB3038 dataset from TSPLib,
where the goal is to find the shortest path across a circuit board
layout. Here, we can view the problem as such: from all possible
 
889Hierarchical Neural Constructive Solver for Real-world TSP Scenarios KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
holes the board can have, and given a subset of these holes, what
is the optimal path of traversal? Solving such problems with high
degrees of accuracy leads to cost savings in manufacturing and
improved yields.
4.2 Benchmark Models
We compare our approach to the following constructive neural
solvers: POMO [ 21] the classical transformer that forms the basis
for many follow-up works, Sym-NCO [15] a follow-up work from
POMO that improves neural solvers by exploiting problem sym-
metry, and ELG [ 10] a recent work that also focuses on locality
by defining a separate local policy based on its k-Nearest Neigh-
bors. All models are trained based on the POMO shared baseline.
It should be noted that in ELG, the authors introduced a different
training algorithm. Since we wish to compare the efficacy of the
architectural contributions, we train the ELG model using POMO.
We reimplement all models and ran on the proposed dataset for our
experimental results.
4.3 Hyperparameters
Since the neural models all share the same underlying backbone
POMO transformer model, we retain the same set of hyperparame-
ters across them to ensure the contributions are purely architectural.
We utilize 6 layers of the transformer encoder and 2 layers of the
transformer decoder. All models are trained for 200 epochs, with
100,000 episodes per epoch and a 1𝑒−4learning rate using the Adam
optimizer [ 16]. Gradient clipping is set to [−10,10]for all models.
For ELG, we used their recommended 50-nearest neighbours. As
for our approach, we set 𝑁𝑐=5embeddings and 𝐵=5iterations
for the hierarchical approach by using a validation set of 1,000
samples for verification. Additional details for hyperparameters
can be found in Appendix A.1.
4.4 Performance Metric
All models are measured by the optimality gap, the percentage gap
between the neural model’s tour length and the optimal tour length.
This is given by
𝑂=(1
𝑁Í𝑁
𝑖𝑅𝑖
1
𝑁Í𝑁
𝑖𝐿𝑖−1)∗100 (24)
where𝐿𝑖is the tour length of test instance 𝑖computed by Concorde.
Also, we perform instance augmentation, just like in POMO, which
involves various translations and reflections across the 𝑥and𝑦axes
[21], as shown in Table 1.
5 RESULTS
5.1 Performance on Uniform Random
Distribution
Table 2 highlights the overall performance of the models on the
classic uniform random sampling dataset. Most models have solid
performance, with augmentation playing a prominent role in boost-
ing the predictive power. Our model and ELG also show the impor-
tance of having some form of local feature to improve the decision-
making process. The addition of our unvisited city tracking viasoft clustering provides additional boost to the model’s predictive
power since we can identify locations on the square.
5.2 Performance on Structured Distributions
Table 3 showcases the different model’s performance on TSP100
instances drawn from various countries. Our model has a clear
advantage in the USA and Japan, with a narrow margin in Burma.
Interestingly, we also see that augmentation has minimal effect on
increasing the solver’s performance, except for the case of Sym-
NCO. It is likely because the maps are no longer symmetric in
nature, and simple transformations do not improve the chances
of finding a very different route. For Sym-NCO, we see that since
it’s specifically trained to exploit augmentations by considering all
symmetries during training, its strong performance only appears
when it can perform those transformations.
5.3 Performance on Varied Sizes
Figure 6 compares the model’s performance between the complete
set of training, 50,000 fixed samples, and 10,000 fixed samples. We
can see that the model performance degrades as expected once data
is limited. However, the ranking of the models is still similar at
the 50,000 sample mark. Interestingly, reducing the dataset further
to 10,000 samples sees ELG becoming the top neural constructive
solver. We attribute ELG’s strong performance on limited data to
its local policy scheme. ELG uses well-crafted local features in the
form of polar coordinates to create their local policy. The direct use
of these features allows their local policy to learn valuable features
to alter the action probabilities easily with less data. It should be
noted that our choice hypernetwork is possibly a larger function
class that also encompasses this approach. Hence, our model can
learn a better overall function when more data is present.
5.4 Performance on PCB3038
Table 5 showcases the performance of the models on the PCB3038
TSPLib dataset. Evidently, the dataset is no longer as symmetric as
before, since Sym-NCO struggles to greatly improve upon POMO.
Instead, some local features are important to have, as displayed by
ELG and our model’s improvement over POMO. Since our approach
is a superset function of ELG, it can learn a better-performing solver,
significantly improving upon POMO.
5.5 Evolution of Embeddings
Soft clustering the nodes in the embedding space is a crucial part of
our overall approach. Therefore, we evaluate if our algorithm indeed
is able to cluster the nodes into a set of meaningful clusters as the
training progresses. Specifically, we conduct a 2D t-SNE plot of the
node and cluster embeddings during the training process. Figure 7
evidently shows that as the training progresses, the cluster centroid
embeddings are better able to separate the node embeddings in the
latent space. This plausibly leads to a better representation of the
unvisited embeddings and hence the problem space, allowing the
model to identify the groups of nodes so as to select similar ones
first.

5.6 Ablation Studies
As shown in Table 4, we perform ablation studies for our network
and consider three different variations. Firstly, POMO + Choiceadds only the local choice layer based on the hypernetwork. Sec-
ondly, POMO + Choice Free replaces the local choice hypernetwork
layer with free parameters, meaning that the weights are no longer
conditioned on the current node’s embedding but rather allowed to

learn freely. Thirdly, POMO + Choice + Average Tracking removes
the soft clustering layer, instead averaging all unvisited nodes into
a single embedding. From the table, we first see that the local choice
layer is essential. Additionally, if we were to remove the ability to
condition on the current node’s position instead, the model would
perform exceptionally poorly - even worse than the original trans-
former network. Finally, if we adopt the simplistic approach of
averaging all unvisited cities, the model performance also suffers,
showcasing the importance of our soft clustering layer.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a more realistic approach to representing
and generating Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) in real-worldcontexts. Our investigation reveals that previous state-of-the-art
neural constructive solvers do not fully exploit the problem’s in-
tricacies to enhance predictive capability. To address this gap, we
present a dual strategy to deal with the problem from two fronts.
Firstly, we emphasize the importance of considering current agent
positions, leading us to introduce a hypernetwork, which enables
dynamic fine-tuning to the decision-making process based on the
agent’s current node position. Secondly, we recognize that realistic
TSP scenarios are often structured, and therefore, improving so-
lutions in such scenarios necessitates a deeper understanding of
the structure of the set of unvisited nodes. Instead of treating all
unvisited nodes uniformly, we propose a soft clustering algorithm
inspired by the EM algorithm. This approach enhances the neu-
ral solver’s performance by grouping nodes based on similarities,
thereby increasing the likelihood of selecting nodes from the same
cluster for early resolution. We illustrate the effectiveness of these
methods across diverse geographical structures. Importantly, our
methods are complementary and can be integrated with existing
models like ELG or Sym-NCO to create more robust solutions.

A APPENDIX
A.1 Hyperparameters
As described in the main body, we retain all original settings of the
transformer. This yields the following:
•6 encoder layers
•2 decoder layers
•We removed global graph embedding as it was found to harm
performance
•Clipping value 𝑈is set to 10.0
•Batch size for training is 128samples
•A total of 200 epochs were run, where each epoch consisted
of100,000episodes
•Adam optimizer was used with a weight decay of 1𝑒−6
•Learning rate of 0.0001 was used
•Unique to our model:
–The soft clustering layer is applied 𝐵=5times
–We use a total of 𝑁𝑐=5embeddings for the clustering
A.2 Model performance across varying dataset
size
Table 6 showcases in detail the bar plot results from Figure 6. Here,
we compare the model’s performance across three different sizes: a
full training dataset of 20,000,000 samples, a small dataset of 50,000
samples repeated across 200 epochs, and an extremely small datasetof 10,000 samples repeated across 200 epochs. In totality, we can
see that even though we reduced the dataset size significantly, the
performance at 50,000 samples is still remarkable. The models retain
the ranking in performance in this scenario. However, reducing
this dataset further sees ELG become the top performing model.
This is likely because ELG leverages distinct features in the form of
polar coordinates in a small k-Nearest Neighborhood. By having
these explicit features, the model requires less data to translate it to
a meaningful representation. Whereas for our model, we learn the
importance of the pairings entirely in the latent space, requiring
more data. It should also be noted that our representation of locality
is likely a superset of ELG’s approach.
A.3 Comparison with General Solvers
While our approach biases the solver towards the distribution, re-
cent works such as GLOP [ 35] proposed generic solvers that utilize
the attention model as a Hamiltonian path solver. Table 7 compares
our neural solver against GLOP. As GLOP’s main premise is to
break down a large problem and solve multiple sub-paths using
local solvers trained on smaller sizes. Since our test results are on
TSP100, we utilize the TSP25 and TSP50 solvers. Overall, we can see
that our approach is stronger than a generically trained solver in
both speed and performance. Nevertheless, since GLOP is based on
the transformer model, our contributions can easily be integrated.
