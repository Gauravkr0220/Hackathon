ABSTRACT
In recent years, Optimized Cost Per Click (OCPC) and Optimized
Cost Per Mille (OCPM) have emerged as the most widely adopted
pricing models in the online advertising industry. However, the
existing literature has yet to identify the specific conditions un-
der which these models outperform traditional pricing models like
Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA). To fill the gap,
this paper builds an economic model that compares OCPC with
CPC and CPA theoretically, which incorporates out-site scenar-
ios and outside options as two key factors. Our analysis reveals
that OCPC can effectively replace CPA by tackling the problem
of advertisers strategically manipulating conversion reporting in
out-site scenarios where conversions occur outside the advertising
platform. Furthermore, OCPC exhibits the potential to surpass CPC
in platform payoffs by providing higher advertiser payoffs and con-
sequently attracting more advertisers. However, if advertisers have
less competitive outside options and consistently stay in the focal
platform, the platform may achieve higher payoffs using CPC. Our
findings deliver valuable insights for online advertising platforms in
selecting optimal pricing models, and provide recommendations for
further enhancing their payoffs. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study to analyze OCPC from an economic perspective.
Moreover, our analysis can be applied to the OCPM model as well.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent decades have witnessed remarkable growth in the online ad-
vertising industry. According to Interactive Advertising Bureau [ 3],
U.S. revenues roared to $209.7 billion in 2022, which marks an ex-
traordinary 30-fold increase over the 2002 figures. Alongside this
rapid expansion, the pricing models in online advertising have also
consistently evolved over the years to adapt to market demands
and technological advancements, as demonstrated in Figure 1.
In essence, the pricing model aims to determine how advertisers
bid and pay for their ads to be displayed on advertising platforms.
For instance, the Cost Per Mille (CPM) model allows advertisers
to bid for ad displays. Then, the advertiser who offers the highest
bid price will be secured with the right to display its ad. However,
similar to traditional advertising media, CPM is not cost-efficient as
it often distributes ads to unrelated users, which is well captured by
the famous marketing quote, "Half the money I spend on advertising
is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half." To address this
issue, the performance-based pricing models, Cost Per Click (CPC)
and Cost Per Action (CPA), were developed in quick succession. In
CPC, advertisers bid for ad clicks and only pay when a user clicks
their ad. The CPA model takes a step further, allowing advertisers
to directly bid for a desired action (e.g. making a purchase), and
only pay when the user completes the desired action. Each time
the user completes the desired action, it results in a conversion.
Most recently, Facebook introduced Optimized Cost Per Click
(OCPC) and Optimized Cost Per Mille (OCPM). Both models inherit
the good property of CPA that allows direct bidding for a conversion,
while advertisers are still obliged to pay when a click occurs or an ad
is displayed, like CPC and CPM. Hence, OCPC and OCPM have now
become the most widely adopted pricing models in the industry,
embraced by major platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, and
Taobao. In contrast, the CPA model, once hailed as the "Holy Grail"
of online advertising, now faces restrictions or is outright banned
in many cases. It has been relegated to a limited set of scenarios,
often accompanied by qualification requirements.
Despite their widespread adoption in practice, the existing lit-
erature has yet to identify the specific conditions under which
OCPC and OCPM can outperform traditional models and the con-
sequences of choosing them over alternatives. To fill this gap, we

build an economic model to theoretically compare OCPC with tra-
ditional pricing models, CPC and CPA. Although our primary focus
is on OCPC as an exemplar, it is worth noting that our analysis
and insights can also apply to OCPM, considering their analogous
structure. We include OCPM and CPM in Appendix A.1.
In our model, we solve an extensive-form game between one
focal platform and two distinct types of advertisers. The game
progresses through several stages. First, the platform selects a pric-
ing model among CPC, CPA, or OCPC. Second, advertisers decide
whether to enter the subsequent auction based on the selected pric-
ing model. Third, a second-price auction ensues for an ad display.
Finally, advertisers finalize payments and all parties realize payoffs.
Our model incorporates two crucial and realistic factors that pre-
vious pricing model research has overlooked. Firstly, we consider
the fact that advertisers have alternative options beyond the focal
platform. Advertisers, particularly those with budget constraints,
may opt not to enter the auction to maximize return on invest-
ment (ROI) unless their payoffs exceed their outside options. On
the other hand, some advertisers do not face budget constraints
and can continue bidding for ads, such as paid video games, as
long as their average cost remains lower than the marginal gain.
Consequently, our model features one advertiser with an outside
option and another without, representing these two types.
Furthermore, we emphasize the impact of conversion rate pre-
diction algorithms. These platforms now employ machine learning
to predict conversion rates for each user and ad, a feat difficult
for advertisers to achieve independently. However, the accuracy
of these predictions hinges on an unbiased training sample. This
requirement may be compromised when conversions occur outside
of platforms and depend on advertisers’ reporting. As a result, we
distinguish between in-site and out-site scenarios based on whether
advertisers can manipulate conversion reporting.
Our model explains why OCPC outperforms CPA in practice.
CPA is vulnerable to conversion reporting manipulation, result-
ing in negligible platform payoffs in out-site scenarios. In contrast,
although advertisers can still manipulate conversion rates under
OCPC, our analysis shows that they possess an incentive to main-
tain accurate conversion rates. There, OCPC functions effectively
across a wider range of out-site scenarios.
Additionally, this paper highlights the trade-offs between OCPC
and CPC. At first glance, platforms might always favor the so-called
"optimized" pricing model, OCPC, over CPC. This preference stemsfrom the potential for increased platform payoffs through OCPC,
as it can attract more advertisers by offering them higher payoffs as
well. However, if advertisers have less competitive outside options
and consistently select the focal platform, the platform may actually
achieve higher payoffs using CPC.
We further generalize our findings for the optimal pricing model
selection among a set of pricing models. We suggest that platforms
should choose a model that strikes a balance between platform
payoffs with a predetermined number of advertisers and advertiser
payoffs that attract more advertisers. When user value is high,
platforms are advised to adopt models that yield higher platform
payoffs. Conversely, platforms should opt for models that provide
greater advertiser payoffs in an alternative manner.
This paper also offers suggestions for platforms to further en-
hance their payoffs. Firstly, platforms should consider shifting their
attention from predicting conversion rates to actively increasing
them, which can improve payoffs in a dual-pronged way. Secondly,
platforms can employ subsidies or coupons to indirectly reduce
outside options, subsequently attracting more advertisers. Lastly,
platforms can develop innovative pricing models that allow adver-
tisers to bid for aspects that fall between clicks and conversions to
fill the gap between CPC and OCPC.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
•To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze
OCPC from an economic perspective, providing theoretical
foundations to online advertising pricing models.
•We have identified two critical factors that account for OCPC’s
prevalence over other pricing models: OCPC surpasses CPA
as it is applicable to the broader out-site scenarios; OCPC out-
performs CPC by attracting a greater number of advertisers
with outside options.
•Our findings provide valuable insights and recommendations
for online advertising platforms to select the optimal pricing
model and enhance their overall payoffs.
2 RELATED LITERATURE
Information systems have been widely used for business [ 18,24–26],
among which Real-time Bidding (RTB) in online advertising allows
ads to be bought and sold on a per-impression (per-ad display)
basis in real-time [ 23]. This process is rooted in auction theories
[6,8,17,22], where an auction among advertisers is conducted as

soon as a user lands on a website. Modern RTB predominantly em-
ploys the generalized second-price (GSP) auction model [ 7,20], in
which the highest bidder secures the top ad placement and pays the
second-highest bid. Similarly, the second-highest bidder acquires
the second placement and pays the third-highest bid, and so forth.
A comprehensive overview was provided by Choi et al. [5].
Economic models have been used to examine pricing models. Hu
[10] initially compared the CPM and CPC using the optimal contract
design framework, while Asdemir et al. [ 2] analyzed the same
models under the principal-agent framework. Both studies argued
that the performance-based CPC model can incentivize publishers
and advertisers to enhance advertising performance. Agarwal et al.
[1] differentiated CPA from CPC. Hu et al. [ 9] delved deeper into
the trade-offs between CPA and CPC, focusing on incentive issues.
Zhu et al. [ 28] and Liu et al. [ 15] investigated hybrid auctions that
allow advertisers to select their preferred pricing models.
However, existing literature on pricing models exhibits several
gaps. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, no existing study has ex-
amined OCPC (or OCPM) as a pricing model. Although some papers
[11,19,27] have explored OCPC’s algorithm system architecture, it
is still unclear under which conditions OCPC should be employed in
comparison to other pricing models. Secondly, the extant literature
on pricing models often assumes that advertisers always partici-
pate in the auction, thereby overlooking the significance of entry
[4,12–14]. This assumption may not accurately reflect real-world
scenarios where advertisers decide whether to enter based on their
outside options. Thirdly, current research on pricing models does
not consider the impact of conversion rate prediction algorithms.
Lu et al. [ 16] highlighted that conversion trackers are just a piece
of JavaScript code that can be arbitrarily excused or not and online
advertising platforms are no way to ascertain that they capture all
the conversions without advertisers’ truthful reports, which may
considerably influence pricing models in a non-trivial manner.
3 PRELIMINARY
In online advertising, an impression occurs when an ad is displayed
on a website or app. A click occurs when a user clicks on the
displayed ad. A conversion occurs when a user completes a desired
action, such as making a purchase, after clicking on the ad.
The CTR (click-through rate) of an ad is the probability of its
impression resulting in a click. The CVR (conversion rate) of an ad
is the probability of its click resulting in a conversion.
We define a pricing model based on what advertisers bid for and
what they ultimately pay for. In CPC (Cost Per Click), advertisers bid
for clicks and pay for clicks. In CPA (Cost Per Action), advertisers
bid for conversions and pay for conversions. In OCPC (Optimized
Cost Per Click), advertisers bid for conversions but pay for clicks.
For instance, in the CPA model, an advertiser might bid $10 for
a conversion, signifying their willingness to pay up to $10 for each
conversion. If a conversion occurs, the advertiser has to pay the
platform up to $10. Alternatively, in the OCPC model, an advertiser
can also bid $10 for a conversion but it makes the payment when a
click occurs. In this case, the payment could be up to $1 per click,
assuming the platform’s predicted CVR is 0.1.
We categorize transactions that take place entirely within the ad
platform as the in-site scenario. Conversely, when users are directedNotation Meaning

4 MODEL
We build an economic model of a game between two representative
advertisers and one advertising platform using the second-price
sealed bid auction under various pricing models.
The purpose of economic models is a simplification of and ab-
straction from complex reality. Previous research on pricing mod-
els typically uses a few representative advertisers to capture the
essence of the focused pricing models while greatly simplifying
the analysis.1For instance, [ 2] evaluates CPC and CPM by one
agent advertiser; [ 9] compares CPA and CPC by two advertisers
with distinct types. We follow this trend while discussing various
extensions to more realistic settings in Appendix A.10.
4.1 Settings
Settings are clearly divided into four bold groups. Table 1 summa-
rizes this paper’s main notations. In addition, we justify this paper’s
assumptions in Appendix A.2.
Advertiser:
We denote the marginal gain from a conversion for advertiser 𝑖
as𝑚𝑖, indicating the profit obtained from each sale/conversion.
We assume advertiser 1 has no outside option, while advertiser
2 has an outside option 𝑟. Consequently, advertiser 1 always enters
the auction and advertiser 2 enters the auction if and only if its
expected payoffs in the auction surpass its outside option, 𝑟.
This asymmetry setting accounts for advertiser diversity. Ad-
vertiser 1 represents the group of advertisers without budget con-
straints, who will pursue conversions at a cost lower than marginal
gain across different platforms. Advertiser 2 represents another
group of advertisers with budget constraints, who will spend their
budget on the most valuable platform to maximize their profit. In
practice, the two groups of advertisers may prefer auto-bidders that
maximize conversion volume or that manage budgets respectively.
CTR and CVR:
We represent advertiser 𝑖’s CTR as𝑐𝑖and CVR as 𝑝𝑖, drawn
from the respective distributions 𝐶𝑖and𝑃𝑖. We define 𝐸(𝐶𝑖)=
𝜇𝑐
𝑖,𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝐶𝑖)=𝜎𝑐
𝑖and𝐸(𝑃𝑖)=𝜇𝑝
𝑖,𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑃𝑖)=𝜎𝑝
𝑖.
1Google’s Chief Economist Hal Varian advises: "An economic model is supposed to
reveal the essence of what is going on: your model should be reduced to just those
pieces that are required to make it work." [21]
4234KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Kaichen Zhang, Zixuan Yuan, Hui Xiong
Online advertising platforms now employ machine learning to
predict CTR and CVR for each ad, a feat difficult for advertisers to
achieve independently. Therefore, we assume that the platform’s
decisions are based on its predictions of 𝑐𝑖and𝑝𝑖, while advertisers
make decisions based on the distribution of 𝐶𝑖and𝑃𝑖and their
belief in the accuracy of the platform’s predictions.
We denote the platform’s prediction for 𝑐𝑖as¯𝑐𝑖and𝑝𝑖as¯𝑝𝑖. We
denote advertiser 𝑖’s belief in¯𝑐𝑖as¯𝐶𝑖and belief in¯𝑝𝑖as¯𝑃𝑖.
For example, consider advertiser 1’s CTR follows a uniform distri-
bution:𝐶1∼𝑈(0.2,0.4). In a specific auction, the actual CTR could
be 0.36,𝑐1=0.36. If the platform consistently underestimates the
CTR by 50%, then the predicted CTR would be¯𝑐1=0.5∗0.36=0.18.
Although advertiser 1 is not aware of the actual CTR (0.36) or
the platform’s prediction (0.18), it can still form a belief about the
platform’s prediction, denoted as¯𝐶1∼𝑈(0.1,0.2).
In-site and Out-site scenario:
We distinguish between in-site and out-site scenarios based on
whether advertisers can manipulate conversion reporting.
In the in-site scenario, we assume the platform’s predictions
are accurate, with¯𝑐𝑖=𝑐𝑖and¯𝑝𝑖=𝑝𝑖, and advertisers’ beliefs
are consistent, with¯𝐶𝑖=𝐶𝑖and¯𝑃𝑖=𝑃𝑖. In the out-site scenario,
advertiser𝑖can establish a reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖∈[0,1], which
signifies that a conversion is only reported with probability 𝛼𝑖upon
receipt. We then assume the platform’s predictions to be¯𝑐𝑖=𝑐𝑖
and¯𝑝𝑖=𝛼𝑖𝑝𝑖, with advertisers’ beliefs at¯𝐶𝑖=𝐶𝑖and¯𝑃𝑖=𝛼𝑖𝑃𝑖.
Our assumptions regarding the platform’s predictions are based
on the characteristics of real-world CTR/CVR supervised learning,
making them suitable for analyzing pricing models. This approach
takes into account the biased sampling error that may arise from
advertisers’ strategic conversion reports while excluding trivial
learning errors to emphasize the primary role of pricing models.
Auction:
We represent advertiser 𝑖’s bid as𝑏𝑖. In CPC,𝑏𝑖denotes advertiser
𝑖’s bid per click, whereas, in CPA and OCPC, 𝑏𝑖signifies advertiser
𝑖’s bid per conversion.
We introduce the concept of advertiser i’s equivalent bid on an
impression as 𝑒𝑖, which refers to the industry concept of ECPM
[27]. The𝑒𝑖facilitates comparisons across various pricing models.
For example, consider a scenario where¯𝑐1=0.3,¯𝑝1=0.2, and
advertiser 1 bids 100 for a conversion, denoted as 𝑏1=100. In this
case, the equivalent bid is calculated as 𝑒1=0.3∗0.2∗100=6. This
suggests that, from the platform’s viewpoint, advertiser 1 bidding
6 for an impression is equivalent. If advertiser 1 bids 10for a click,
the equivalent bid becomes 𝑒1=10∗0.3=3.
The platform selects the advertiser with the highest equivalent
bid on an impression as the winner, denoted as 𝑤=𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑒𝑖. Another
advertiser is deemed the loser, represented as 𝑙=𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑒𝑖.
4.2 Timeline
The following timeline outlines the progression of the game:
(1) The platform selects a model among CPC, CPA, or OCPC.
(2) Advertiser 2 determines whether to enter the auction.
(3)Advertisers select their bids and, if in the out-site scenario,
also decide on their reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖.
(4)The actual values of 𝑐𝑖and𝑝𝑖are realized, while the platform
predicts¯𝑐𝑖and¯𝑝𝑖, and calculates 𝑒𝑖.(5)The platform identifies the auction winner ( 𝑤=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑒𝑖)
and display its ad.
(6) The winner makes payments and all parties realize payoffs.
We will analyze the game in both the in-site and out-site scenar-
ios. The key difference between the two scenarios is that advertisers
need to decide on a conversion reporting strategy in the out-site
scenario (step 3), which also affects the payment process (step 6).
To solve the overall game, we will employ backward induction,
focusing on each subgame where the platform has chosen a specific
pricing model and both advertisers have opted to participate in the
auction. We will begin our analysis from step 3 for each subgame.
5 IN-SITE SCENARIO
We initiate our analysis from the in-site scenario, in which advertis-
ing platforms can accurately track conversions. For each subgame,
we will explore the optimal bidding strategy employed by advertis-
ers and evaluate the resulting payoffs for all parties involved.
5.1 Cost Per Click
In CPC, advertisers bid for clicks and pay for clicks.
As advertisers bid for clicks, the platform predicts advertiser 𝑖’s
equivalent bid on an impression as 𝑒𝑖=¯𝑐𝑖𝑏𝑖. Following the second-
price auction, the platform selects the advertiser with the highest
equivalent bid on an impression, denoted as 𝑤=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑒𝑖=
𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖¯𝑐𝑖𝑏𝑖, to be the winner and receive the impression.
As advertisers pay for clicks, the auction winner has to pay¯𝑐𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤
if a click occurs. The loser pays 0. This payment is based on the
intuition that the equivalent payment for an impression is¯𝑐𝑙𝑏𝑙,
where𝑙denotes the advertiser with the second-highest bid in the
model. However, since advertisers pay for a click in CPC, the auction
winner should pay¯𝑐𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤for each click because every1
¯𝑐𝑤impression
generates a click on average.
Given another advertiser 𝑘’s equivalent bid on an impression 𝑒𝑘,
advertiser𝑖’s utility is:
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
when advertiser 𝑖bid𝑏𝑖per click in CPC.
The first component, 𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘), represents advertiser 𝑖’s
winning probability. The second component represents its expected
gain upon winning. The 𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖represents its revenue from the
auctioned impression, while 𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖represents the associated cost.
Proposition 5.1. Under CPC, a dominant strategy for advertiser
𝑖is to bid𝑏𝑖=𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖, which is equal to the product of the expected
conversion rate and the marginal gain from a conversion.
Proof. We show that 𝜋𝑖(𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖|𝑒𝑘)≥𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)for any𝑒𝑘.
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘

This optimal bidding strategy aligns with the truth-telling prop-
erty in second-price auctions, where an advertiser’s optimal bid
is equal to their valuation of the auctioned impression. However,
due to the lack of knowledge regarding the actual conversion rate
(𝑝𝑖), advertisers can only estimate the valuation using their average
conversion rate ( 𝜇𝑝
𝑖). In practice, this average conversion rate can
be calculated by dividing the total number of conversions by the
total number of clicks.
Next, we determine the payoffs for each party in the CPC model,
focusing on the in-site scenario, denoted by 𝐼−.

5.2 Cost Per Action
In CPA, advertisers bid for conversions and pay for conversions.
As advertisers bid for conversions, the platform’s prediction on
advertiser𝑖’s equivalent bid on an impression is 𝑒𝑖=¯𝑐𝑖¯𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑖.
As advertisers pay for conversions, the auction winner has to
pay¯𝑐𝑙¯𝑝𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤¯𝑝𝑤if a conversion occurs. The loser pays 0. In the in-site
scenario, the platform can accurately track conversions, which
ensures a conversion will always result in a payment.Given another advertiser 𝑘’s equivalent bid on an impression 𝑒𝑘,
advertiser𝑖’s utility is:
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
when advertiser 𝑖bid𝑏𝑖per conversion in CPA.
Proposition 5.2. Under CPA in the in-site scenario, a dominant
strategy for advertiser 𝑖is to bid𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖.
The proof of Proposition 5.2 can be found in Appendix A.3.
Proposition 5.2 reinforces the assertion that "CPA, or cost per
action, is the Holy Grail for targeted advertising", because advertis-
ers only need to bid their marginal gain from a conversion without
any estimation on CTR and CVR. This is particularly important for
fresh ad campaigns and advertisers who are new to the platform
because there is no historical data for accurate estimation. These ad-
vertisers can circumvent the potential losses resulting from biased
estimations, by directly bidding their marginal gain.
We then examine the payoffs associated with CPA for each party.

5.3 Optimized Cost Per Click
In OCPC, advertisers bid for conversions but pay for clicks.
As advertisers bid for conversions, the platform’s prediction on
advertiser𝑖’s equivalent bid on an impression is 𝑒𝑖=¯𝑐𝑖¯𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑖.
As advertisers pay for clicks, the auction winner has to pay¯𝑐𝑙¯𝑝𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤
if a click occurs. The loser pays 0.
In both CPA and OCPC, advertisers bid for conversions, resulting
in an equivalent bid on an impression, denoted as 𝑒𝑖. However,
OCPC’s payment structure differs from CPA, as advertisers pay for
clicks instead of conversions. OCPC’s payment would be calculated
as¯𝑝𝑙𝑏𝑙per click, rather than 𝑏𝑙per conversion.
Given another advertiser 𝑘’s equivalent bid on an impression 𝑒𝑘,
advertiser𝑖’s utility is:
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘

Proposition 5.3. Under OCPC in the in-site scenario, a dominant
strategy for advertiser 𝑖is to bid𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖.

Focusing on the in-site scenario, we observe that advertisers
employ a similar bidding strategy in OCPC as in CPA, wherein
they conveniently bid their marginal gain. Moreover, the payoffs
for each party remain consistent across both pricing models. We

will provide a comprehensive analysis of these aspects in Section 7,
following our discussion of the out-site scenario in Section 6.
6 OUT-SITE SCENARIO
In this section, we discuss CPC, CPA, and OCPC in the out-site
scenario, where advertisers can manipulate conversion reporting.
6.1 Cost Per Click
Recall that in CPC, advertisers bid for clicks and pay for clicks. The
auction winner, denoted as 𝑤=argmax𝑖¯𝑐𝑖𝑏𝑖, receives the auctioned
impression and has to pay¯𝑐𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤if a click occurs.
It is important to note that CPC does not require online platforms
to predict conversion rates. This simplifies the deployment of the
CPC model, which likely explains their emergence before CPA.
Additionally, in CPC, payments are made irrespective of con-
versions. The transaction between the platform and the winning
advertiser concludes upon a click, whether or not it occurs. From
that point onward, the advertiser bears the risk or benefit of a click
eventually leading to a conversion.
These characteristics show CPC is irrelevant to CVR predictions.
As a result, CPC does not differ between the in-site and out-site
scenarios that differ in CVR prediction manipulation:
Proposition 6.1. Under CPC, there is no difference between the
subgame in the in-site scenario and the subgame in the out-site sce-
nario.
Advertiser𝑖also bids𝑏𝑖=𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖for a click. Furthermore, the
payoffs for each party in the out-site scenario ( 𝑂−) are identical to
the payoffs in the in-site scenario ( 𝐼−).

6.2 Cost Per Action
Recall that in CPA, advertisers bid for conversions and pay for con-
versions. The auction winner, represented by 𝑤=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖¯𝑐𝑖¯𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑖,
receives the impression and must pay¯𝑐𝑙¯𝑝𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤¯𝑝𝑤if a conversion occurs.
The main difference in the in-site scenario is that advertiser 𝑖
will select a reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖∈[0,1], indicating that it only
reports a conversion with probability 𝛼𝑖when a conversion occurs.
The reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖impacts the game in two ways. First, by
setting𝛼𝑖<1, the advertiser can make the payment less frequent.
This creates an incentive for advertisers not to report conversions,
as it can reduce their payment. However, the advertising platform
will also adjust its CVR prediction to¯𝑝𝑖=𝛼𝑖𝑝𝑖, which decreases
the likelihood of advertiser 𝑖winning the auction. As a result, the
overall effect of conversion self-reporting remains unclear.
Thus, given another advertiser 𝑘’s equivalent bid on an impres-
sion𝑒𝑘, advertiser𝑖’s utility is:
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)when advertiser 𝑖bid𝑏𝑖per conversion in CPA. Note that there is
an additional 𝛼𝑖term in the out-site scenario.
Proposition 6.2. Under CPA in the out-site scenario, an equilib-
rium does not exist, as advertisers can always obtain a higher payoff
by reducing their reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖.
Proof. We use proof by contradiction. If an equilibrium exists,
in which the reporting strategy of advertiser 𝑖is𝛼𝑖∗. In this equi-
librium, we have¯𝑝𝑖=𝛼𝑖∗𝑝𝑖and¯𝑃𝑖=𝛼𝑖∗𝑃𝑖.
If𝛼𝑖∗=0, then¯𝑝𝑖=0and𝑒𝑖=0. In this case, advertiser 𝑖always
loses the auction and attains a payoff of 0. Consequently, advertiser
𝑖can deviate to a positive 𝛼𝑖∗to achieve a positive payoff.
If𝛼𝑖∗>0, we can deduce that for any 𝛼𝑖>0, the optimal
𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖, i.e.,𝜋𝑖(𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘) ≥𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)for any𝑒𝑘. The full
proof is provided in Appendix A.5. When 𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖, we have:
𝜋𝑖(𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)
=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖𝛼𝑖∗𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝛼𝑖
𝛼𝑖∗𝑒𝑘|¯𝐶𝑖𝛼𝑖∗𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
Note that𝜋𝑖increases as 𝛼𝑖decreases. By deviating to 𝛼𝑖=𝜖𝛼𝑖∗,
where 0<𝜖<1, advertiser 𝑖can achieve a higher payoff, which
leads to a contradiction. □
When advertisers adopt a fixed reporting strategy, regardless of
the value of 𝛼𝑖(0.1 or even 0), the platform can compensate for this
effect on payment by adjusting their CVR prediction to align with
the reporting strategy, such that¯𝑝𝑖=𝛼𝑖𝑝𝑖.
However, the consequence of CPA in the out-site scenario is
highly detrimental for platforms. Advertisers will continually lower
their reporting strategy to evade payment, causing the platform’s
revenue to approach zero. The platform cannot immediately detect
or respond to the lowered reporting probability because the CVR
prediction algorithm learning takes time.
Furthermore, the auction loses its effectiveness in selecting the
highest value ad, as it devolves into a competition of who can submit
the largest number, considering that 𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖. Consequently, both
advertisers may have an equal 50% chance of winning under the
CPA model in the out-site scenario. So we have:
Advertiser𝑖’s payoff,𝜋𝑖
𝑂−𝐶𝑃𝐴=1

Platform’s payoff, 𝜋𝑃
𝑂−𝐶𝑃𝐴=0.

6.3 Optimized Cost Per Click
Recall that in OCPC, advertisers bid for conversions but pay for
clicks. The auction winner, represented by 𝑤=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖¯𝑐𝑖¯𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑖,
receives the impression and has to pay¯𝑐𝑙¯𝑝𝑙𝑏𝑙
¯𝑐𝑤if a click occurs.
Advertiser𝑖will also select a reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖. We aim to
investigate whether this reporting strategy also results in a dys-
functional OCPC, similar to the issues observed in CPA.

Figure 2: Equilibrium Payoffs When the Outside Option 𝑟is Varying
Given another advertiser 𝑘’s equivalent bid on an impression 𝑒𝑘,
advertiser𝑖’s utility is:
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
when advertiser 𝑖bid𝑏𝑖per conversion in OCPC.
Proposition 6.3. Under OCPC in the out-site scenario, a set of
dominant strategies for advertiser 𝑖is to bid𝛼𝑖𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖.
Proof. We first show that 𝛼𝑖and𝑏𝑖always appear together. So
we can represent 𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)by𝜋𝑖(𝛼𝑖𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘).
𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
=𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒𝑘)
=𝜋𝑖(𝛼𝑖𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)
We can then deduce that 𝜋𝑖(𝑚𝑖|𝑒𝑘)≥𝜋𝑖(𝛼𝑖𝑏𝑖|𝑒𝑘)for any𝑒𝑘. The
full proof can be found in Appendix A.6. □
Proposition 6.3 suggests that the possible bidding and reporting
strategy combinations include 𝛼𝑖=0.2,𝑏𝑖=5𝑚𝑖and𝛼𝑖=0.5,𝑏𝑖=
2𝑚𝑖, among others. The truth-telling strategy, 𝛼𝑖=1,𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖, is
also part of their dominant strategies. Consequently, we have
Corollary 6.4. Truth-telling, i.e., bidding 𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖and𝛼𝑖=1, is
a dominant strategy under OCPC in the out-site scenario.
Corollary 6.4 implies that the game outcome of OCPC in the
out-site scenario is identical to the in-site scenario, as the optimal
bidding strategy for advertisers is always to bid their marginal gain,
𝑚𝑖. Although advertisers can manipulate conversion reporting in
the out-site scenario, our proofs reveal that their optimal strategies
consistently correspond to no manipulation. Hence, the payoffs for
each party are as follows:

7.1 Comparison between OCPC and CPA
The main advantage of OCPC over CPA is its applicability to the
out-site scenarios. In such scenarios, the platform’s payoff un-
der CPA, denoted as 𝜋𝑃
𝑂−𝐶𝑃𝐴, is zero due to conversion report-
ing manipulation. However, in OCPC, even though advertisers
can manipulate conversion rates, our analysis indicates that it
still yields positive platform payoffs, represented as 𝜋𝑃
𝑂−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=
𝐸(𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝐶1𝑃1𝑚1,𝐶2𝑃2𝑚2))=𝜋𝑃
𝐼−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶>0. This outcome is consis-
tent with the in-site scenario as well. Furthermore, the social wel-
fare in OCPC surpasses that in CPA, as evidenced by 𝜋𝑆
𝑂−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶>
𝜋𝑆
𝑂−𝐶𝑃𝐴, since OCPC can effectively screen out the ad with the
highest value in out-site scenarios, which CPA is unable to do.
Additionally, even in the in-site scenario, OCPC achieves identi-
cal results as CPA: both the platform’s payoff, 𝜋𝑝
𝐼−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝜋𝑝
𝐼−𝐶𝑃𝐴,
the advertisers’ payoffs, 𝜋𝑖
𝐼−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝜋𝑖
𝐼−𝐶𝑃𝐴, and the social welfare,
𝜋𝑆
𝐼−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝜋𝑆
𝐼−𝐶𝑃𝐴are the same.
Our analysis explains why OCPC prevails over CPA in practice,
given its broader applicability to out-site scenarios while maintain-
ing the same performance in in-site scenarios as CPA. Consequently,
OCPC serves as an ideal substitute for CPA.
7.2 Comparison between OCPC and CPC
First, both OCPC and CPC exhibit the desirable property that the
outcomes of the out-site scenario align with those of the in-site
scenario. This property ensures their broad applicability across
various situations.
We proceed to compare the payoffs for each party between OCPC
and CPC. We have the following lemma:
Lemma 7.1. The social welfare in OCPC is greater than in CPC:
𝜋𝑆
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝐸(𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐶1𝑃1𝑚1,𝐶2𝑃2𝑚2))
>𝜋𝑆
𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝐸(𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐶1𝜇𝑝
1𝑚1,𝐶2𝜇𝑝
2𝑚2))
The reason that OCPC yields higher social welfare than CPC
lies in its increased efficiency with respect to ad delivery. In OCPC,
the platform is responsible for predicting CVR and can employ
advanced machine learning techniques to accurately determine the
CVR and identify the most valuable ad. In contrast, CPC requires
advertisers to estimate their CVR through crude averaging methods.
However, we also have:
4238KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Kaichen Zhang, Zixuan Yuan, Hui Xiong
Lemma 7.2. The platform’s expected payoff in OCPC is less than
in CPC:
𝜋𝑃
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝐸(𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝐶1𝑃1𝑚1,𝐶2𝑃2𝑚2))
<𝜋𝑃
𝐶𝑃𝐶=𝐸(𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝐶1𝜇𝑝
1𝑚1,𝐶2𝜇𝑝
2𝑚2))
The intuition behind Lemmas 7.1 and 7.2 can be illustrated by
considering the example of rolling two dice. The expected value
of the maximum of these two dice (approximately 4.47) should
be greater than the maximum of the expected value of two dice
(max 3.5,3.5=3.5). Conversely, the expected value of the minimum
of these two dice (around 2.53) should be less than the minimum of
the expected value of two dice (3 .5).
At first glance, Lemma 7.2 may suggest that platforms should opt
for CPC over OCPC, as CPC yields a higher platform payoff. How-
ever, this is not universally true. The current comparison between
OCPC and CPC is based on the subgames in which advertisers have
already decided to participate in the auction. Advertiser 2 possesses
an outside option, 𝑟, and will choose not to enter the auction if the
expected payoff is less than 𝑟. Furthermore, we have:
Lemma 7.3. The advertisers’ expected payoff in OCPC is greater
than in CPC:
𝜋𝑖
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶=
𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑘𝑃𝑘𝑚𝑘|𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖>𝐶𝑘𝑃𝑘𝑚𝑘)𝑃𝑟(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖>𝐶𝑘𝑃𝑘𝑚𝑘)
>𝜋𝑖
𝐶𝑃𝐶=
𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑘𝑃𝑘𝑚𝑘|𝐶𝑖𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖>𝐶𝑘𝜇𝑝
𝑘𝑚𝑘)𝑃𝑟(𝐶𝑖𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖>𝐶𝑘𝜇𝑝
𝑘𝑚𝑘)
Lemma 7.3 is based on the intuition that social welfare is the sum
of platform payoff and advertiser payoff. CPC results in a lower
social welfare and a higher platform payoff, which consequently
leads to a lower advertiser payoff. The formal proofs of the three
lemmas are given in Appendix A.7, A.8, and A.9.
Lemma 7.3 suggests that if 𝜋2
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶>𝑟>𝜋2
𝐶𝑃𝐶, advertiser 2 will
enter the OCPC auction but not the CPC auction because its payoff
in CPC is lower than its outside option. Consequently, advertiser
2’s absence from the auction would lead to a decrease in platform
payoffs under the CPC model.
Our analysis illuminates the trade-offs between OCPC and CPC
models. Platforms can achieve higher payoffs by adopting OCPC, as
it can draw a larger number of advertisers by providing them with
increased payoffs. However, if advertisers have less competitive
alternative options and consistently opt for the focal platform, the
platform may be able to attain higher payoffs using the CPC model.
7.3 Optimal Pricing Model for Platforms
We then generalize our findings for the optimal pricing model
selection among a set of pricing models, by solving the second and
first stages of our game.
In the second stage, given that the platform has selected pricing
model𝑋, advertiser 2 will participate in the auction if and only if
its payoffs from the auction exceed its outside option 𝑟:
𝜋2
𝑋>𝑟
Conversely, advertiser 1 consistently enters the auction as it
does not have an outside option. This necessitates that the platform
opts for a pricing model ensuring advertiser 2’s participation in theauction. If only advertiser 1 is present, the platform will invariably
receive zero payoffs due to the second-price auction.
As a result, in the first stage, the platform selects a pricing model
that guarantees advertiser 2’s involvement in the auction first and
then maximizes its payoffs. The optimal pricing model is
𝑋∗=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑋𝜋𝑃
𝑋
𝑠.𝑡.𝜋2
𝑋>𝑟
This equation indicates that if a platform impulsively shifts to a
pricing model featuring higher platform payoffs but lower adver-
tiser payoffs, it might mistakenly perceive an increase in payoffs
through A/B testing. However, its payoffs will ultimately decline as
some advertisers with budget constraints opt to leave the platform.
Our analysis suggests that platforms maintain a balance between
platform payoffs with a predetermined number of advertisers and
advertiser payoffs that draw in more advertisers. When user value
is substantial, advertisers will naturally join the platform, enabling
pricing models with high platform payoffs. Conversely, platforms
should adopt pricing models with high advertiser payoffs to en-
hance their payoffs in an alternative manner.
7.4 Equilibrium
We further examine the game’s equilibriums under various outside
options𝑟. Figure 2 illustrates each party’s payoff under different
outside options in the out-site scenario. Specifically, Figure 2 (1) to
(4) show the platform’s payoff, social welfare, advertiser 1’s payoff,
and advertiser 2’s payoff, respectively.
As seen in Figure 2, when 𝑟<𝜋2
𝐶𝑃𝐶, the platform selects CPC.
When𝜋2
𝐶𝑃𝐶<𝑟<𝜋2
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶, the platform selects OCPC. For 𝑟>
𝜋2
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶, the platform exhibits indifference between pricing models
as the payoffs remain consistently zero.
The shaded region in vertical lines highlights the benefits from
OCPC’s innovation. Prior to OCPC’s development, the platform
would incur no payoff when 𝜋2
𝐶𝑃𝐶<𝑟<𝜋2
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶, as advertiser 2
would abstain from entering the auction. This shaded region de-
picted in Figure 2 (1) signifies the enhancement in platform payoffs
due to OCPC, indicating that developing a new pricing model that
yields higher advertiser payoffs is advantageous for platforms.
Interestingly, not all parties benefit from OCPC. The dotted re-
gion in Figure 2 (3) signifies a decrease in advertiser 1’s payoff.
This outcome occurs because OCPC introduces more competitors
for those who consistently participate in auctions. As competition
intensifies, bidding becomes more aggressive, leading to higher
costs and subsequently reducing payoffs for these advertisers.
7.5 Managerial Implications
Firstly, platforms can increase their payoffs by appropriately shift-
ing their focus from CTR and CVR prediction to improving CTR and
CTR. Overemphasizing CTR and CVR prediction and ad ranking
may lead to diminishing returns because there is an upper bound on
the platform’s payoff, in which each ad is ranked accurately based
on its value. On the other hand, improving CTR and CVR boost
payoffs in two ways: enhancing 𝐶𝑖or𝑃𝑖directly increases both
𝜋𝑃
𝐶𝑃𝐶and𝜋𝑃
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶and attracts more advertisers by shifting 𝜋2
𝐶𝑃𝐶
and𝜋2
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶to the right. To achieve this, platforms can expand their
high net worth user base, make ads more contextually relevant to

their services, and improve ad quality. The role of algorithms in
facilitating these improvements remains a promising direction for
future research.
Secondly, platforms can increase their payoffs by indirectly re-
ducing advertisers’ outside options. One potential approach in-
volves offering subsidies or coupons to advertisers. For instance, if
𝑟=𝜋2
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶, advertiser 2 will not enter the auction, resulting in no
payoff for the platform. However, providing a small subsidy, 𝜖, to
advertiser 2 will result in their participation in the auction, and the
platform will receive a payoff of 𝜋𝑃
𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶−𝜖. The primary challenge
in delivering subsidies lies in identifying deserving advertisers and
determining the minimum subsidy amount, given that advertisers
are highly strategic in such games.
Figure 3: Cost Per Shopping Cart (CPSC) Example
Lastly, platforms can increase their payoffs by developing new
pricing models wherein advertisers bid for intermediate outcomes
between clicks and conversions. For example, we can develop a
pricing model for online retailers called Cost Per Shopping Cart
(CPSC), where advertisers bid for instances when a user adds a
product to their shopping cart and they pay for clicks or impressions.
As illustrated in Figure 3, CPSC attracts more advertisers than CPC
and generates higher platform payoffs than OCPC. The shaded
region represents its benefits.
8 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this paper pioneers the study of the Optimized Cost
Per Click (OCPC) pricing model in online advertising from an eco-
nomic perspective. This paper identifies two key factors contribut-
ing to OCPC’s prevalence: its versatility in out-site scenarios when
advertisers can manipulate conversion reporting and its ability to
attract more advertisers with outside options. This paper sheds
light on the optimal pricing model selection for online advertising
platforms and offers suggestions to further improve their payoffs.

A APPENDIX
A.1 Other Pricing Models
The definition of CPM and OCPM is included in this section. Their
analysis is analogous to CPC and OCPC.
A.1.1 Cost Per Mille. In CPM, advertisers bid for impressions
and pay for impressions.
As advertisers bid for impressions, the platform predicts adver-
tiser𝑖’s equivalent bid on an impression as 𝑒𝑖=𝑏𝑖.
As advertisers pay for impressions, the auction winner has to
pay𝑏𝑙after the ad display. The loser pays 0.
A.1.2 Optimized Cost Per Mille. In OCPM, advertisers bid for
conversions but pay for impressions.
As advertisers bid for conversions, the platform’s prediction on
advertiser𝑖’s equivalent bid on an impression is 𝑒𝑖=¯𝑐𝑖¯𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑖.
As advertisers pay for impressions, the auction winner has to
pay¯𝑐𝑙¯𝑝𝑙𝑏𝑙immediately after the ad display. The loser pays 0.
A.2 Assumption Justification
We justify the assumptions made in this paper:
(1)Advertiser 1 has no outside option, while advertiser 2 has an
outside option 𝑟: refer to Section 4.1.
(2)The platform’s decisions are based on its predictions of 𝑐𝑖and

to CTR/CVR predictions.
(3)Advertisers make decisions based on the distribution of 𝐶𝑖

on their CTR/CVR, evidenced by various CTR/CVR statics
in advertiser panels offered by platforms.

predictions and can only form belief instead.
(5)The platform’s predictions are accurate, with¯𝑐𝑖=𝑐𝑖and

tions to be accurate. This assumption is made for the sake of
mathematical convenience.

A.5 Proof of Proposition 6.2
Suppose there exists an equilibrium, where advertiser 𝑖’s reporting
strategy is𝛼𝑖∗. Then, there is¯𝑝𝑖=𝛼𝑖∗𝑝𝑖and¯𝑃𝑖=𝛼𝑖∗𝑃𝑖accordingly
in this equilibrium.
If𝛼𝑖∗=0, then¯𝑝𝑖=0and𝑒𝑖=0. Advertiser 𝑖will always lose
the auction and have a 0utility. Thus, advertiser 𝑖can deviate to a
positive𝛼𝑖∗to have a positive utility.
If𝛼𝑖∗>0, we show that given an 𝛼𝑖>0, the optimal 𝑏𝑖=𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖,
i.e.,𝜋𝑖(𝑚𝑖
𝛼𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)≥𝜋𝑖(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒𝑘)for any𝑒𝑘.

If advertiser 𝑖wins in both OCPC and CPC, its payoffs are the
same (𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑘𝑃𝑘𝑚𝑘) in both OCPC and CPC. If advertiser 𝑖
loses in both OCPC and CPC, its payoffs are also the same (0). The

because both terms are positive.
A.10 Extensions
A.10.1 Repeated Auctions. We extend our model to the repeated
auction setting, i.e., multiple auctions are in the game. Specifically,
the timeline of the new game is as follows:
(1) The platform selects a model among CPC, CPA, or OCPC.
(2) Advertiser 2 determines whether to enter the auction.
(3)Advertisers select their bids and, if in the out-site scenario,
also decide on their reporting strategy 𝛼𝑖.
(4)The actual values of 𝑐𝑖and𝑝𝑖are realized, while the platform
predicts¯𝑐𝑖and¯𝑝𝑖, and calculates 𝑒𝑖.
(5)The platform identifies the auction winner ( 𝑤=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑒𝑖)
and display its ad.
(6) The winner makes payments and all parties realize payoffs.
(7) The steps (3) to (6) will be repeated 𝑇times.
Compared to the original game, the new game now has 𝑇auctions.
The overall utility of the game is the sum of the utility of each
auction.
We show that the repeated auction setting has the same bidding
strategies as the original setting.
Using CPC as an example, the utility of advertiser 𝑖is:
𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝜋𝑖
𝑡(𝑏𝑖
𝑡|𝑒𝑘
𝑡)=𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖𝑏𝑖
𝑡>𝑒𝑘
𝑡)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒𝑘
𝑡
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖𝑏𝑖
𝑡>𝑒𝑘
𝑡)
where another advertiser 𝑘’s equivalent bid on an impression in
auction𝑡is𝑒𝑘
𝑡, and advertiser 𝑖bid in auction 𝑡is𝑏𝑖
𝑡.
We notice that bidding 𝑏𝑖
𝑡=𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖is the dominant strategy in
each auction, regardless of how others bid ( 𝑒𝑘
𝑡). As a result, we have:
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝜋𝑖
𝑡(𝑏𝑖
𝑡|𝑒𝑘
𝑡)=𝑇∑︁
𝑡=1𝜋𝑖
𝑡(𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖|𝑒𝑘
𝑡)=𝑇𝜋𝑖(𝜇𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑖|𝑒𝑘)
where advertiser 𝑖’s utility in the repeated auctions setting is exactly
𝑇times the original setting. Consequently, the platform’s utility is
also𝑇times as much as before.The above analysis demonstrates that the analysis applied to the
original setting also applies to the repeated auctions setting, since
each agent’s utility is scaled up by a factor of 𝑇.
A.10.2 Multiple Advertisers. We extend our model to the multi-
ple advertiser setting, where there are 𝑁advertisers in the game.
We show that our main insights also hold in the multiple adver-
tiser setting: for online advertising platforms, (1) OCPC dominates
CPA; (2) OCPC does not dominate CPC.
We define the highest equivalent bid on an impression of other
advertisers as 𝑒−𝑖for advertiser 𝑖. By its definition,
𝑒−𝑖=𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑘≠𝑖𝑒𝑘
In the in-site scenario, advertiser 𝑖’s utility in CPA and OCPC
are respectively
𝜋𝑖
𝐼−𝐶𝑃𝐴(𝑏𝑖|𝑒−𝑖)=
𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑒−𝑖
¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)
and
𝜋𝑖
𝐼−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶(𝑏𝑖|𝑒−𝑖)=
𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒−𝑖
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)
Similarly, in the out-site scenario, advertiser 𝑖’s utility in CPA
and OCPC are respectively
𝜋𝑖
𝑂−𝐶𝑃𝐴(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒−𝑖)=
𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑒−𝑖
¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)
and
𝜋𝑖
𝑂−𝑂𝐶𝑃𝐶(𝑏𝑖,𝛼𝑖|𝑒−𝑖)=
𝑃𝑟(¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)𝐸(𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑚𝑖−𝐶𝑖𝑒−𝑖
¯𝐶𝑖|¯𝐶𝑖¯𝑃𝑖𝑏𝑖>𝑒−𝑖)
Note that the utility of advertiser 𝑖in the multiple advertiser set-
ting can be derived by simply replacing 𝑒𝑘with𝑒−𝑖. This is because
the second-price auction format ensures that whether advertiser 𝑖
wins or loses, and how much it pays, depends only on the highest
one among the others. Consequently, the proofs in the original
setting also apply to the multiple advertiser setting by replacing 𝑒𝑘
with𝑒−𝑖.
As a result, OCPC also dominates CPA, given its broader applica-
bility to out-site scenarios while maintaining the same performance
in in-site scenarios as CPA.
To show that OCPC does not dominate CPC, we should find a
counterexample where CPC leads to a higher payoff than OCPC
for platforms. Obviously, by setting 𝑁=2, we have found such a
counterexample in this paper’s main body.
