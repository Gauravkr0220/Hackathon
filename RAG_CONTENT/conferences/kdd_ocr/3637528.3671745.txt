ABSTRACT
Fine-grained entity typing (FET), which assigns entities in text with
context-sensitive, fine-grained semantic types, is a basic but im-
portant task for knowledge extraction from unstructured text. FET
has been studied extensively in natural language processing and
typically relies on human-annotated corpora for training, which is
costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies explore the utilization
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) as a knowledge base to gen-
erate rich and context-aware weak supervision for FET. However, a
PLM still requires direction and guidance to serve as a knowledge
base as they often generate a mixture of rough and fine-grained
types, or tokens unsuitable for typing. In this study, we vision that
an ontology provides a semantics-rich, hierarchical structure, which
will help select the best results generated by multiple PLM models
and head words. Specifically, we propose a novel annotation-free,
ontology-guided FET method, OntoType, which follows a type on-
tological structure, from coarse to fine, ensembles multiple PLM
prompting results to generate a set of type candidates, and refines
its type resolution, under the local context with a natural language
inference model. Our experiments on the Ontonotes, FIGER, and
NYT datasets using their associated ontological structures demon-
strate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot
fine-grained entity typing methods as well as a typical LLM method,
ChatGPT. Our error analysis shows that refinement of the existing
ontology structures will further improve fine-grained entity typing.

1 INTRODUCTION
Fine-grained entity typing (FET) is a basic but important task for
knowledge extraction and text content understanding/analysis. As-
signing fine-grained semantic types to parsed entity mention spans
based on the local context enables effective and structured analysis
of unstructured text data, such as entity linking [ 15,21], relation
extraction [12], and coreference resolution [21].
Example 1. Given a sentence 𝑆1: “Sammy Sosa got a standing ova-
tion at Wrigley Field.” and a parsed entity mention span “ Sammy
Sosa” in the sentence, an FET method aims to assign it not only
the coarse-grained type “Person” but also the fine-grained types
“Athlete” or “Player”.
FET on large text corpora is a challenging task due to (1) the
high cost of obtaining a large amount of human-annotated training
data, especially in dynamic and emerging domains, and (2) inaccu-
rate annotations due to (i) different annotators marking concepts
at different granularity (e.g., person vs. politician vs. president),
and (ii) contextual subtlety on fine-grained types (e.g., Boston vs.
Detroit could be two sports teams, instead of two cities). Most ex-
isting methods utilize weak or distant supervision to automatically
generate training data for the FET tasks. There are three major ap-
proaches to obtaining weakly-labeled training data to tackle these
challenges. The first is to automatically match the mentions in text
with the concepts in some existing knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia)
[15]. The typical workflow is to first detect entity mentions from
a corpus, map these mentions to knowledge base (KB) entities of
target types, and then leverage the confidently mapped types as
pseudo-labeled data to infer the final type. The second is to directly
obtain the head words of nominal mentions as its fine-grained type
[3]. This approach leverages the head words of the entity mention
to consolidate context-aware types derived from the KB matching.
However, both approaches suffer from label sparsity and context-
agnostic problems, resulting in the inability to generate high-quality
training data for FET.

The third approach is to probe the pre-trained language models
through the use of masked patterns and entailment templates. This
method enables the use of PLM as a knowledge base for weak
supervision. Leveraging masked language model (MLM) prompting
to generate rich and context-aware weak supervisions for fine-
grained entity typing is a recent trend, aiming to leverage a PLM’s
contextual and “common-sense” knowledge learned at training to
reduce expensive human labor [4, 13].
Given a sentence that contains a mention, one can use a “[MASK]”
token to replace the entity mention span to generate candidate
entity types. However, such a method is unguided which may result
in the generation of tokens that are inadequate for entity typing
(e.g., {This, That, Him, Me, It} for “Wrigley Field” in 𝑆1).
Alternatively, we can seek to extract hypernyms of the entity
mention span of interest by inserting a short phrase that contains a
“[MASK]” token (e.g., exploring the idea of Hearst Patterns [ 8]). This
method conducts labeling in a more context-aware manner and
greatly enriches the fine-grained types labeled for each mention.
This process, however, still has the potential to generate tokens
unsuitable for typing (e.g., {Team, Thing} for “Wrigley Field” in 𝑆1)
or a mixture of rough and fine-grained types (e.g., {Location, Build-
ing, Stadium}). The difficulty cannot be resolved automatically due
to the lack of hierarchical knowledge of the generated tokens/types.
With the emergence of large language model (LLM) (e.g., Chat-
GPT [ 22]), it is appealing to directly apply it to tackle these chal-
lenges. However, due to the lack of knowledge structures, an LLM
may generate entity types at a too coarse or too fine level, or fail to
commit to the right one from numerous fine-grained candidates.
In this study, we envision that an ontology structure, which
provides a semantics-rich, hierarchical structure, may help select
the best results generated by multiple PLM models. We propose a
annotation-free ,ontology-guided ,fine-grained entity typing (FET)
method, OntoType, that leverages an input ontology structure and
the power of MLM prompting and Natural Language Inference
(NLI). We first ensemble multiple Hearst patterns to perform MLM
prompting, reducing the noise in the initial candidate type genera-
tion. Since the generated candidate labels for a given mention are
likely a mixture of fine and coarse-grained labels, or tokens unsuit-
able for typing, we propose to automatically match the generated
candidate labels to a coarse-grained type in our type ontology and
then rank and select a coarse-grained type with a pre-trained entail-
ment model under the local context. Based on the same principle of
entailment score-based type selection, this type resolution process
progresses deeper to finer levels, following the type ontology, until
the finest possible label can be consolidated.
Example 2. For sentence 𝑆1in Ex. 1, candidate type generation
(Step 1) ensembles prompting results of multiple Hearst patterns
and generates a set of candidate labels: {Stadium, Venues, Location,
Game} for “Wrigley Field” (Fig. 2). Using a given ontology structure
(Fig. 1), this set of types is first resolved to the course-grained type
“Location” via the assistance of a pre-trained entailment model
and the local contextual information (Fig. 3). Note without the
type structure, “Stadium” and “Venue” are rivals to “Location”; but
with the structure, they become its supporters since both are fine-
grained “Location”. With the same principle, the type resolution
proceeds deeper to finer-grained levels, along the type ontology,from “Location” to “Building” and further down to “Stadium” for
“Wrigley Field”, leading to the most accurate fine-grained type (Fig.
4).
Our contributions are summarized as follows.
(1)A fully annotation-free, ontology-guided, fine-grained typing
method, OntoType, is proposed
(2)OntoType improves fine-grained entity typing (FET) by lever-
aging candidate labels generated and refined with three informa-
tion sources: (i) pre-trained language models, (ii) a fine-grained
type ontology, and (iii) head words
(3)Experiments on the Ontonotes, FIGER, and NYT datasets [ 6]
using their associated ontological structures show that Onto-
Type clearly outperforms existing zero-shot named entity typ-
ing methods as well as ChatGPT, and even rivals supervised
methods. Our error analysis shows that refinement of ontology
structures will further improve fine-grained entity typing.
2 RELATED WORK
Fine-grained entity typing benefits various downstream tasks and
has received extensive attention in natural language research. Re-
cent studies focus on different contexts from the phrase level [ 35]
to considering specific entity mentions in the sentence or document
level [ 3,7,15]. Entity typing has been generally studied under su-
pervised learning settings with significant human annotated data
[3, 4, 15, 36].
Minimally Annotated Fine-Grained Entity Typing Methods.
Some recent studies (e.g., [ 4,9,13,14,16,33,39,40]) leverage cross-
encoders, pre-trained language models and prompting templates
to obtain knowledge for entity mentions in given sentences. [ 4]
improves ultra-fine entity typing with a BERT Masked Language
Model (MLM). [ 13] instead improves ultra-fine entity typing by
treating the task of predicting an entity type as an NLI task. Similar
toOntoType, ChemNER [ 30] leverages a type ontology structure
to guide fine-grained Chemistry entity recognition. NFETC-SSL
[33] proposes a semi-supervised learning method with mixed label
smoothing and pseudo labeling. MCCE [ 9] proposes to first prune
the large type set and generate K candidates. Then, MCCE’s novel
model concurrently encodes and scores these K candidates as final
type labels. DenoiseFET [ 14] utilizes pre-trained label embeddings
to group the given set of type labels into semantic domains. A fine-
tuned UFET model is utilized to predict initial labels. Finally, the
semantic domains as guidance to infer missing labels and remove
conflicting labels. These recent methods leverage human annota-
tions and seek to augment SOTA models with prior knowledge
acquired through head words, ontology structures and pre-trained
embeddings. OntoType seeks to perform FET without the use of
any human annotations by amalgamating multiple MLM prompts
and NLI results to reduce noises in candidate type generation. Fi-
nally, we also utilize the fine-grained type ontology structure as
guidance to progressively resolve candidate labels from coarse to
fine under the local context.
Distant Supervision via Knowledge Bases. To handle difficul-
ties to acquire human annotation, the zero-shot learning setting
has been introduced for named entity typing [ 32]. Several stud-
ies [37,41] address the problems by grounding the mentions with
Knowledge Base (i.e. Wikipedia) entries from the assembled related

pages. These methods achieve good performance but still require
significant human resources to construct effective knowledge bases
which can be difficult to obtain for emerging domains.
Transfer Learning Methods. Other studies explore learning pre-
trained semantic word-level embeddings from Knowledge Bases
and seen types [ 18,23] or extracting raw embeddings without
auxiliary information and utilize end-to-end neural networks [ 38].
However, these methods still suffer from low accuracy and ineffi-
ciency in zero-shot settings. As a result, OntoType turns to the
weak supervision by exploiting pre-trained language models (i.e.
BERT [ 5]) as a knowledge base due to their substantial knowledge
in language understanding learned by training on massive text
collections.
3 METHODOLOGY
We propose OntoType, an annotation-free, ontology-guided, fine-
grained entity typing method using pre-trained language models
and a fine-grained ontology structure. Given an input sentence and
a set of pre-identified mentions in the sentence, OntoType consists
of the following steps: (1) generating a set of candidate labels for
each input mention with both head word parsing and an ensemble
of MLM prompting (Fig. 2); (2) resolving the coarse-grained types
by matching and ranking the generated labels to the type ontology
using an entailment model (Fig. 3); and (3) progressively refining the
fine-grained types along the type ontology following the principle
of entailment score-based type selection (Fig. 4). We utilize the
inherent structure of the fine-grained type ontology and a pre-
trained entailment model (RoBERTa model pre-trained on the MNLI
dataset [17]) to guide our fine-grained entity typing.
3.1 Problem Definition
The input to our proposed OntoType framework is a text corpus
𝐷and a fine-grained type ontology 𝑂. In this study, we assume our
input text corpus 𝐷includes a set of pre-identified entity mentions.
An entity mention, 𝑒, is a token span in the text document that
refers to a real-world entity. Given a sentence 𝑆and a parsed entity
mention𝑒∈𝑆, the fine-grained entity typing (FET) task is to
identify one or more types 𝑡from the label space 𝑇(provided in a
structured ontology 𝐺) for the entity mention 𝑒.
As an example of our FET task, in the sentence 𝑆1of Ex. 1,
the entity mention to be typed is 𝑒1: “Wrigley Field ”. It should be
labeled progressively deeper as “Location →Building→Stadium” as
opposed to other labels like “Organization”, “Person”, or “School”.
3.1.1 Fine-Grained Type Ontology Structure. The structure of the
type ontology is fundamental to the OntoType algorithm. In this
study, we utilize zero human effort to construct our type ontolo-
gies. We leverage the fine-grained type ontologies provided in
the OntoNotes and FIGER datasets. Extending these ontologies
to new text corpora can be achieved with minimal human efforts
through taxonomy completion and refinement methods[ 1,10,11,
25]. Furthermore, existing automatic ontology constructions meth-
ods [ 28,29,31] build ontologies also based on “is-A” relations (e.g.,
a “Canada” is a “Country”) which minimize the need for human-
annotated ontologies even in emerging domains.Definition 3.1 (Fine-Grained Type Ontology). OntoType’s Fine-
Grained Type Ontologies are structured as a strict tree imposing an
“is-a” type hierarchy stemming from a “root” concept. The “root”
concept’s children consist of a handful of coarse-grained types
including but not limited to: “Organization”, “Person”, or “Loca-
tion”. In addition, the ontology follows the following structural
constraints: (1) Each type has a singular parent type; (2) each type
(except for the leaf node) can have a number of children; and (3)
each type is connected by a directional edge indicating a hypernym-
hyponym type relationship between the parent and child nodes.
It is important to recognize that a hypernym-hyponym or “is-a”
relationship is critical for guiding OntoType ’s final fine-grained
type selection. Note that in the given OntoNotes type ontology (Fig.
1), City and Country are sibling types since they share the same par-
ent type Location. Although “City” can be connected to “Country”
by a “is-in” type relationship, OntoType’s input ontologies orga-
nize these entity types as siblings due to their hypernym-hyponym
relationship to “Location”. By consolidating hypernyms of the en-
tity mention, we can identify the high-level type in the ontology
that accurately provides a partial label for the entity mention of
interest. Thus, we approach our entity typing process in a hierar-
chical manner and refine from a coarse-grained level down to the
most accurate fine-grained level for the mention of interest.
Please note that an ontology structure can be extended to include
“is-in”, “is-part-of” and “is-property-of” relationships. Fine-grained
entity typing using such an extended structure is left to future
work.

3.2 Candidate Type Generation
To generate a set of candidate entity types for each input mention,
we leverage two techniques: (1) head word parsing, and (2) ensemble
of hypernyms derived from MLM prompting.
Head words and hypernyms can serve as powerful context-aware
type indicators that can be leveraged as weak supervision sources
for entity typing [ 3,4]. We use them to select a set of candidate types
to guide our fine-grained type refinement. We first generate and
parse the head words for a given entity mention, and then generate
candidate types with the use of ensembled MLM prompting1. The
generated candidates are used as input to the following steps of
ontology-guided type resolution.
1If there is no head word, our algorithm generates candidate labels using only MLM
prompting.

3.2.1 Head Word Parsing. As discussed in [ 3], the input text often
contains cues that explicitly match a mention to its type. These
cues are often in the form of the mention’s head word. Thus, given
the pre-identified entity mentions in the input sentence, we first
identify the head word of the input mention. We utilize the Stan-
ford Dependency Parser [2] to extract the head word of the entity
that we are interested in typing. Considering the sentence “Gover-
nor Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a speech at Mission Serve’s service
project on Veterans Day 2010 ”, the entity mention “Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger ” can be associated with a few types (e.g., actor,
father, and governor). However, given the head word, one can eas-
ily consolidate it to the right one: “governor”. Thus, OntoType
leverages the head word of the input entity, if any, to select an
initial context-sensitive type, which may guide the selection of the
subsequent fine-grained type.
3.2.2 Ensembled MLM Prompting. While head words can provide
strong type indicators, they do not always provide sufficient in-
formation to consolidate a high-level type. In some cases, head
words (e.g., “Red Sox star”) cannot directly provide accurate type
information as they are not directly present in the input type on-
tology. Furthermore, head words are not always available in the
input sentences. Thus, with the parsed entity mention span as in-
put, we propose to leverage context-aware hypernyms as initial
type candidates for the target mention. With an ensembled cloze
prompting method, OntoType generates candidate types of the
mention with masked language models and performs an initial
high-level typing on the input mention. Specifically, we leverage
the BERT model [ 5] and artificial Hearst patterns [ 8] to generate
context-aware hypernyms that serve as candidate types for the
mentions. We first modify the input sentence by inserting a Hearst
pattern and [MASK] token into the sentence. Then we use the BERT
to generate candidate types for the target mention under the local
context. For example, in Fig. 2, we first insert Hearst patterns such
as “and the other [MASK]” in the input sentence and then use the
BERT MLM model to generate candidate types such as “Venue”,
“Team”, and “Stadium”.
We evaluated the quality of hypernyms generated with direct
masked prompting and the 44 patterns proposed in [ 24] on the
Ontonotes Development Dataset. When generating hypernyms, we
expect high-quality candidates to be semantically equivalent to
concepts contained in our input type ontology.
Unfortunately, we found that direct masked prompting resulted
in tokens that were indefinite and unsuitable to serve as candidate
types. Based on our observation, the four Hearst patterns in Table
1 provide the highest quality hypernyms under a simple direct
matching to types in the OntoNotes ontology.
Nevertheless, based on the syntax and grammar of the sentence,
hearst patterns can generate tokens that are unsuitable to serve as
fine-grained entity types. For example, with a single prompt, the
MLM can generate “Famous”, “Actor”, “Celebrity” and “Person” as
the most probable words, where “Famous” is unsuitable to serve as a
fine-grained entity type. To reduce the noises caused by the use of a
single Hearst pattern, we ensemble 𝑛Hearst Patterns to consolidate
the most commonly generated candidate types. For each pattern in
the pattern list 𝑃, we collect the top 𝑘most probable tokens from
the probability distribution predicted by the BERT MLM. Then, weMasked Prompt Pattern Prec Rec F1

3.3 High-Level Type Resolution
Given the generated candidate types and head words for each men-
tion in the sentence, we seek to resolve the concrete type for this
candidate type set at the high levels of the type ontology. Specifi-
cally, we first align the generated candidates to several high-level
types in the type ontology, and then select the most accurate high-
level types with a pre-trained entailment language model.
3.3.1 Candidate Type Alignment. Following the previous step of
candidate type generation, we combine the generated candidates
from both the parsed head words and the ensembled cloze prompt-
ing to form a candidate type set. These candidates are generally
noisy and may not exist directly in our type ontology. However, we
observe that the generated candidates will usually cluster closely
around a high-level concept in the ontology. Thus, we perform our
high-level type alignment with a cosine-similarity-based matching.
 
1410OntoType: Ontology-Guided and PLM-Assisted Fine-Grained Entity Typing KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
We use Word2Vec2[19] embeddings to construct our type embed-
dings for the cosine-similarity-based type alignment. We construct a
verbalizer by selecting at least 𝑙semantically related words for each
coarse type. For a high-level type of “Organization”, we might in-
clude seed types such as “Corporation”, “University”, “Firm”, “Busi-
ness”, and “Government” in its verbalizer. This verbalizer is then
utilized to systematically map the MLM hypernym prediction to
the most relevant type. In our experiments, we provide at least
five seed types 𝑆for each type node 𝑐in the first level of the type
ontology. Increasing the number of seed types increases the cov-
erage and confidence of the verbalizer. Since the most commonly
generated hypernyms for each concept are in the input ontologies,
OntoType is not sensitive to the number of seed types collected.
With the seed types, we construct a node embedding 𝑁by taking
the average of word embeddings from both the first-level type and
its corresponding seed types,
𝑁=Í
𝑠𝑖∈𝑆𝑒𝑚𝑏(𝑠𝑖)+𝑒𝑚𝑏(𝑐)
|𝑆|+1. (2)
where𝑒𝑚𝑏(·)indicates the Word2Vec embeddings.
Then we rank each generated candidate type to a first-level type
on our type ontology by calculating the cosine similarity between
the embeddings of the generated candidate labels 𝑏and that of the
first-level types 𝑇,
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑏,𝑇)rank=𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑒𝑚𝑏(𝑏),𝑒𝑚𝑏(𝑇)). (3)
Finally, the first-level type that has the highest similarity is selected
as the aligned high-level type.

Figure 3: Candidate Type Generation
Example 4: In Figures 2 and 3, the consolidated candidate labels
“Location”, “Stadium”, “Venue”, and “Game” are closely related to
the high-level type “Location” in our ontology. By performing the
cosine-similarity-based matching, “Location” is identified as 𝑒1’s
high-level type over “Organization” or “Person”. Thus, we select
the most similar high-level type given by the head word, generated
candidate labels, and the entailment model.
3.3.2 High-Level Type Selection. After the previous step of candi-
date type alignment, we obtain several high-level types for each
entity mention in the sentence. Given these types, we seek to select
the most accurate high-level type for each entity mention under
the local context. We observe that the task of selecting the most
appropriate entity type can be viewed as a Natural Language Infer-
ence (NLI) task. Thus, we treat the input sentence as the premise
in NLI and generate the hypothesis using a pre-defined declarative
2https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/template. To resolve the type of the input mention, we use the tem-
plate: “ In this sentence, [MENTION] is a [TYPE]. ” We then
rank each type in the first level of the ontology with the entailment
score from a RoBERTa NLI model [17].
Example 5: In Fig. 3, we align a majority of the generated candidate
type set to the Location seed types. The NLI model further ranks
Location over Organization or Person. By utilizing the information
in conjunction, 𝑒1is solidly aligned to the high-level type “Location”.
3.4 Fine-Grained Type Resolution
Given the high-level types of the entity mentions, OntoType fur-
ther leverages the ontology structure to progressively resolve the
fine-grained label. Following the same principle of entailment-based
type selection for the high-level types, we utilize the entailment
model [ 17] to compute the entailment score, 𝜎𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙 . Then, Onto-
Type can automatically select the most accurate fine-grained entity
types along our type ontology. Specifically, we first examine the
child types of the previously determined higher-level types and
then select the child type with the highest ranked score as the
fine-grained type.
In addition to the entailment model, we also utilize the candidate
type set to refine our fine-grained type selection. If the parsed
head word is present in our type ontology, the entailment scores of
that parent and its child types are weighted higher through 𝜎𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑.
Similarly, if the generated candidate types are in our type ontology,
the entailment scores of their parents and children are also weighted
higher through 𝜎𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑. Finally, we select the fine-grained type for
each mention with the highest-ranked score.
We calculate the ranking score for the entities at the current
level of the ontology as follows:
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒)=𝜎𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙+𝜎𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 (4)
We first leverage our NLI pre-trained model [ 17] to find the en-
tailment score 𝜎𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙 for each entity type. Then if a type in the
candidate type set is a descendent to the entity type, we add a
weight𝜎𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑. We repeat this entailment-based selection process
recursively along the type ontology to select the best fine-grained
type.
Definition (Entity Type Granularity Parameter 𝜃): We assume
there is a scalar of 𝜃indicating how granular or specific the final
selected entity type should be. The smaller 𝜃is, the more granular
entity types are consolidated as the final one.
Thus, if the child types do not have a sufficient gain of at least
𝜃in ranking score over the parent type at a certain level, we stop
the recursion and select the parent type as the final fine-grained
type. We conduct a parameter study to explore the sensitivity of
OntoType to the parameter 𝜃in Section 4.4.1.
Example 6: In Fig. 4, we consider all descendent types of “Location”
as potential fine-grained entity types for 𝑒1. To begin, OntoType
generates the hypotheses and ranks all child types of “Location”.
With the resultant entailment score rankings of these sibling types,
we consolidate and select “Building” as the highest-ranked type.
Then, a similar process is done at a deeper level of the ontology to
select the final type “Stadium”.

4.1 Datasets
We compare the performance of OntoType and several baseline
methods on three benchmark FET datasets: NYT, Ontonotes [ 6] and
FIGER [15]. The basic statistics of the datasets are shown in Table
2. For the OntoNotes and FIGER datasets, we leverage the included
type ontologies while the NYT dataset leverages the input FIGER
ontology. All NER test sets are annotated using the ontologies as
a set of type labels. Thus, each entity mention is labeled with a
fine-grained label represented as a path within the ontology. The
ontologies have a maximum depth of three and contain four to six
high-level types (e.g., Location, Person, and Organization).
4.2 Baselines
OntoType is a FET method that does not require human annotation
as supervision. We compare OntoType with four weakly supervised
and nine zero-shot FET methods utilizing the evaluation metrics
detailed in Appendix A.
For each baseline method, we utilize the default parameters
as detailed in their studies. Furthermore, we conduct all experi-
ments on a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. Finally, we evalu-
ate generative LLMs on FET using Gemma 2b model[ 26], Llama
2 7b model[ 27] and OpenAI “gpt-3.5-turbo”[ 22].OntoType lever-
ages a pre-trained BERT [ 5] (BERT-base, uncased) and pre-trained
RoBERTa fine-tuned on the MNLI dataset [ 17] available in the Hug-
gingFace Library. In addition, OntoType utilizes Word2Vec3[19]
embeddings to construct our type embeddings. Finally, we conduct
parameter and ablation studies listed in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2
respectively.
Weak Supervision with Human Annotations.
UFET [3]: This weakly supervised baseline is a model that predicts
open types and is trained using a multitask objective that pools
head-word supervision with supervision from entity linking.
3https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/BERT MLMET [4]: This weakly supervised baseline fine-tunes a
BERT-based model using human annotations, supervision from
head words and mention hypernyms generated from Hearst pat-
terns.
LITE [13]: This weakly supervised baseline is a fine-tuned MNLI
model leveraged to rank ultra-fine entity types.
NFETC-SSL [34]: This weakly supervised baseline proposes a semi-
supervised learning method with mixed label smoothing and pseudo
labeling for fine-grained entity typing.
Distant Supervision from Knowledge Bases.
ZOE [41]: This zero-shot baseline leverages a type taxonomy de-
fined as Boolean functions of Freebase types and grounds a given
entity mention to the type-compatible Wikipedia entries to infer
the target mention’s types.
DZET [20]: This zero-shot baseline utilizes the type description
available from Wikipedia to build a distributed semantic repre-
sentation of the types and aligns the target entity mention type
representations onto the known types.
Transfer Learning Methods.
OTyper [37]: This zero-shot baseline is a neural network trained
on a limited training dataset. The model is evaluated on the Open
Named Entity Typing task, which is FET where the set of target
types is not unknown.
MZET [38]: This zero-shot baseline leverages the semantic meaning
and the hierarchical structure into the type representation. The
method leverages the knowledge from seen types to label the zero-
shot types through the use of a memory component.
ChatGPT [22]: This zero-shot, annotation-free baseline leverages a
generative large language model as a knowledge source for entity
typing. We evaluate ChatGPT on three different prompts to mitigate
possible prompt construction-based errors.
Prompt1: “Return the fine-grained entity types of the given entity
mentioned in the sentences below. Be concise and ONLY utilize the
types from this list of possible entity types. [entity types] {entity types}
[sentence] {sentence} [entity mention] {entity mention}”.
Prompt2: “Select a single label from the following list that best
serves as a hyponym for the entity mention. [labels] {entity types}
[sentence] {sentence} [entity mention] {entity mention}"
Prompt3: "Select the single most fine-grained entity type from the
following list for the given entity mention. [entity types] {entity types}
[sentence] {sentence} [entity mention] {entity mention}"
We discuss the limitations of leveraging ChatGPT as a fine-
grained entity typing method in Section 5.3.
Gemma [26]: This zero-shot, annotation-free baseline leverages a
generative large language model as a knowledge source for entity
typing. We utilize Prompt1 for evaluation on the FET task.
LLaMA 2 [27]: This zero-shot, annotation-free baseline leverages a
generative large language model as a knowledge source for entity
typing. We utilize Prompt1 for evaluation on the FET task.

ZOE. While on the Ontonotes dataset, OntoType achieves the best
zero-shot performance on this dataset while trailing the best su-
pervised method by 3.94 Ma-F1 points. OntoType achieves 14.6
absolute Ma-F1 improvement over the state-of-the-art zero-shot
fine-grained entity typing method ZOE.
A performance comparison between OntoType and ZOE demon-
strates the benefit of leveraging the knowledge embedded in pre-
trained language models as a form of minimal supervision to iden-
tify entity mention types. ZOE leverages a type ontology and maps
a given mention to type-compatible Wikipedia Entries. As a result,
ZOE relies on surface-level information from the mention string.
OntoType ensembles contextual information from various PLMs
to consolidate the final entity type. Given a sentence: “The biggest
cause for concern for McGuff is the bruised hamstring Regina Rogers
suffered against (Utah) last Saturday ”, ZOE incorrectly utilizes the
surface string to label “Utah” as a location. With PLMs, OntoType
recognizes “Team” or “Opponent” as candidates and finally consoli-
dates to “Sports Team”.

Table 4: Type predictions (in color) on three entity mentions
(in bold): ONTOTYPE vs. two other Zero-Shot FET methods.
On the FIGER dataset, OntoType achieves 0.3 absolute Macro-
F1 improvement over state-of-the-art zero-shot fine-grained entity
typing method ZOE [ 41]. However, our method trails ZOE in strict
accuracy and Micro-F1. In the FIGER dataset, predictions are made
based on both the surface-level information and the contextual
information in the sentence. The major advantage of OntoTypeis to accurately capture the contextual information to provide a
fine-grained entity type. However, OntoType does not involve a
mechanism to capture the surface-level information of an entity
mention. We discuss this issue further in our error analysis (Section
5.2).
4.4 Ablation and Parameter Studies
4.4.1 Study of Sensitivity to Parameters. A potential concern with
the experimental setup can be overtly high sensitivity of OntoType
to the Entity Type Specificity parameter 𝜃. For all experiments in
Table 3, we leverage the same 𝜃value of 0.3. Additionally, from the
plot in Figure 5, we clearly see that F1 scores are not drastically
sensitive to theta with standard deviations of 0.3631 and 0.6262 on
FIGER and OntoNotes respectively.

4.4.2 OntoType Module Ablation Study. We also include the pre-
diction results of our ablation models to demonstrate how the NLI
module contributes to the final type assignment. We utilize a simple
type mapping to evaluate our ensembled BERT Cloze Prompting
module. Figure 6 shows the results of ablation studies on the test set
of the Ontonotes dataset. We compared the OntoType full model
with various ablations and variations. We find that direct prompting
performs the worst whereas including parsed head words further
improves the recall. Including the NLI module significantly im-
proves the precision of the framework as we are able to leverage
the type hierarchy to consolidate the fine-grained type that best
represents the initial candidates. Furthermore, we include Table 6 to
examine alternative embedding approaches for the high-level type
assignment. When performing high-level type assignment, we aim
 
1413KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Tanay Komarlu, Minhao Jiang, Xuan Wang, and Jiawei Han
to leverage the surface-level information of the candidate type set
to select the high-level type that is most conceptually similar. As a
result, we find the one with word2vec embeddings performs better
than BERT[ 5] and RoBERTa[ 17] which incorporate the semantic
context of a word in the sentence.
4.4.3 Efficiency & Scalability Study. Finally, we conduct an effi-
ciency and scalability study to gauge the impact of larger scale data
sets on our method and include the results in Table 5.

4.5 Comparative Case Study
Table 4 presents a sentence from a recent news article with tagged
mentions and predicted entity types. We find that methods like
MZET sometimes predict incompatible types due to incorrect or
misleading surface information. For example, when typing “The
White House”, MZET and ZOE leverage the surface-level informa-
tion from large KBs to identify the mention as a location. However,
given the local context, the White House clearly refers to the U.S.
government. When considering the mention “US President Joe
Biden”, our method utilizes the type information from the can-
didate type set (Official, Leader, Politician, Individual) to explore
the “Person” branch within the ontology, and then it searches the
“Politician” branch to select the best fine-grained context-aware
type “President” for our given entity mention. Thus, with the assis-
tance of the PLMs, we can incorporate contextual information to
derive more context-aware type labels.5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Modified Fine-Grained Type Ontology
The structure of the fine-grained type ontology is important to
the performance of OntoType. The input ontology must be built
using hypernym-type relationships where each parent type is a
generalization of the child type. The provided FIGER ontology
contains logical inconsistencies in how various types of relations
are organized.
For example, the FIGER ontology considers the parent of the
“Road” type to be “Transportation” rather than “Location”. This
logical inconsistency leads to erroneous typing from our method.
Table 3 includes our results on the test set of FIGER with and
without a modified type ontology.
The modification of an ontology is done by reorganizing the
types to leverage hypernym-hyponym type relationships. That is,
in the revised type ontology, each parent type is a generalization of
its child(ren) type(s). The included FIGER type ontology considers
the parent type of the “Road” type to be "Other\Transportation”
and the parent type of “Building” to be “Other”. While “Other” can
be considered a valid generalization, it is extremely broad and the
coarse-grained type of “Location” serves as a stronger parent for
both fine-grained types. Thus, we modify the included ontology
by reorganizing the fine-grained types under parent types that
have stronger generalizations (e.g., Building & Road under Loca-
tion rather than Other). OntoType achieves 2.1 absolute Ma-F1
improvement given this modified type ontology. Thus, we find that
OntoType can be further improved with correct type ontologies to
leverage the inherent hierarchical relationships between coarse and
fine-grained types. We provide insights into specific reasons for
the mistakes made by the OntoType framework. For our analysis,
we collect some of the erroneous decisions in the Ontonotes and
FIGER test sets. We highlight the Gold Type for each mention in
blue.
5.2 Error Analysis: OntoType
OntoType, though having high performance, still generates non-
trivial errors. We analyze the reasons behind the errors on the
Ontonotes and FIGER test sets and categorize them into three types.
Note the Gold Type for each mention is highlighted in blue (and
Italian font ).
Error Type 1: Lack of Knowledge Base
Sentence E1: He was a caseworker in Minnesota [\Location\Region]
but left the job because he found himself perpetually sick from the
environments in which he worked.
In E1, OntoType incorrectly types Minnesota as a Country rather
than the gold type of Region. In context, we should consider State
a more reasonable type to predict. With a simple KB-matching
method, we would be able to capture the surface-level information
to type it as a State/Province. OntoType relies on neither human
annotations nor a knowledge base. Obviously, introducing a knowl-
edge base and the KB-matching mechanism will further improve
its performance.
Error Type 2: Incomplete Fine-Grained Type Ontology
Sentence E2: Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Im-
perial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to
 
1414OntoType: Ontology-Guided and PLM-Assisted Fine-Grained Entity Typing KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
buyfive Valley Federal branches [\Location\Structure], leaving
the transaction in limbo.
In E2, OntoType generates \Other. Even when OntoType is able
to generate high-quality candidate labels, it can sometimes fail
to align to the correct entity type due to an incomplete type set.
In this example, our Candidate Type set generated by prompting
consists of Asset, Property, Facility, Bank, and Branch. Clearly, the
best fine-grained type should be Asset or Property (rather than the
Gold Type: Location or Structure). Since the provided OntoNotes
ontology does not include such fine-grained types, OntoType is
unable to generate the correct answer. Clearly, a refined ontology
will further improve its performance.
Error Type 3: Incapability to Type Nested Entities
Sentence E3: The 33-year-old Billings [\Location\City] native
enlisted as a military veterinarian.
In E3, OntoType identifies Billings as \Person. This mistake can
be caused by confusing the type of the whole entity “Billings na-
tive” with the type of the nested entity “Billings”. PLM is good at
generating candidate types for the whole entity based on its con-
textual structure, whereas the knowledge about a nested entity like
“Billings” (in front of head word “native”) can be more easily derived
from a knowledge-base or from some nested entity type patterns.
We will leave the issue of typing nested entities to future work.
5.3 Error Analysis: LLM on Fine-grained Typing
Recent developments of large language models (LLMs) (e.g., Chat-
GPT and GPT-4 [ 22]) lead to enhanced capability at generating
high-quality responses to prompts based on the knowledge learned
from their extensive training corpora. Clearly, LLMs can provide
stronger context-aware knowledge for OntoType’s candidate type
generation. However, without an ontological structure as guidance,
an LLM (e.g. ChaptGPT) may still generate many errors, leading to
lower performance than our method, as shown in Table 3. Here we
conduct error analysis for types generated by ChatGPT through
the following prompt: “Return the fine-grained entity types of the
given entity mentioned in the sentences below. Be concise and ONLY
utilize the types from this list of possible entity types. [entity types]
{entity types} [sentence] {sentence} [entity mention] {entity mention}”.
LLM Error Type 1: Incomplete Entity Types
LLM-E1: Given a sentence 𝑆2: “The ceremony will take place Feb.
16–20.” and a parsed entity mention span “Feb. 16–20 ”, we prompted
ChatGPT to generate candidate types for the masked entity mention
span, which generates: “Later”, “There”, “Outside” and “Indoors”.
While these tokens complete the sentence accurately, they cannot
serve as precise hypernyms or fine-grained types for the entity
mention span of interest. With Hearst patterns, we can elicit more
accurate hypernyms like “Time”, “Date” and “Event”. However, we
are still unable to derive the most accurate fine-grained label of
“Period” or “Interval”. In contrast, OntoType utilizes a top-down
approach guided by a fine-grained type ontology to refine and
finally select the most conclusive entity type.
LLM Error Type 2: Incorrect Entity Types
LLM-E2: Given a sentence 𝑆3: “It will be the first time the Falcon
Heavy has conducted a launch for the U.S. military’s secretive X-37B
spaceplane project ” and a parsed entity mention span “Falcon Heavy ”,we can again prompt ChatGPT to generate candidate types for the
masked entity mention span. With our prompt, ChatGPT generates:
“Company”, “Organization”, “Team”, “Government”, and “Agency”.
With Hearst patterns, we can extract more accurate candidates
like “Vehicle”, “Carrier” and “Launcher”. Furthermore, ChatGPT is
unable to derive the most accurate fine-grained label of “Spacecraft”,
“Shuttle” or “Rocket”. While some generated tokens accurately type
the mention span, ChatGPT still requires a structured mechanism
to mitigate hallucinations and select the most fine-grained entity
type.
Overall, to achieve high quality fine-grained typing, we believe
an LLM should be assisted with structured knowledge (e.g., a fine-
grained ontological structure), which is an interesting direction for
future research.
6 CONCLUSIONS
We propose OntoType, which leverages the weak supervision set-
ting of pre-trained language model prompting. We use head words
and MLM cloze prompting for fine-grained candidate label genera-
tion. Then we automatically match the generated fine-grained types
to our type ontology with an inference method to select the most
appropriate fine-grained types under the local context. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets show that OntoType is highly
effective and substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-
shot FET methods. In the future, we plan to further refine and enrich
a type ontology which will enable us to incorporate more type in-
formation for even better performance. Furthermore, OntoType
lacks the capability to address nested entities (e.g., Denver Native).
We plan to resolve this in future work by incorporating boundary
knowledge to extract accurate and complete type information.

A EVALUATION METRICS
Following the prior FET studies ([ 4], [15], [18]), we evaluate our
methods and the baselines using three evaluation metrics: Strict
Accuracy (Acc), Micro-F1 (Mi-F1), and Macro-F1 (Ma-F1).
Accuracy. Given a set of entity mentions 𝑀, we denote the set of
ground truths and predicted types as 𝑡𝑀and ˆ𝑡𝑀respectively. Given
𝜎as an indicator function, strict accuracy is defined as
𝐴𝑐𝑐=Σ𝑚∈𝑀𝜎(𝑡𝑚==ˆ𝑡𝑚)
𝑀
Macro-F1. Macro-F1 is calculated using Macro-Precision ( 𝑃𝑚𝑎) and
Macro-Recall ( 𝑅𝑚𝑎) where
𝑃𝑚𝑎=1
|𝑀|Σ𝑚∈𝑀|𝑡𝑚∩ˆ𝑡𝑚|
ˆ𝑡𝑚
𝑅𝑚𝑎=1
|𝑀|Σ𝑚∈𝑀|𝑡𝑚∩ˆ𝑡𝑚|
𝑡𝑚
Micro-F1. Micro-F1 is calculated using Micro-Precision ( 𝑃𝑚𝑖) and
Micro-Recall ( 𝑅𝑚𝑖) where
𝑃𝑚𝑖=Σ𝑚∈𝑀|𝑡𝑚∩ˆ𝑡𝑚|
Σ𝑚∈𝑀ˆ𝑡𝑚
𝑅𝑚𝑖=Σ𝑚∈𝑀|𝑡𝑚∩ˆ𝑡𝑚|
Σ𝑚∈𝑀𝑡𝑚
Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 are calculated using the F1 score formula
with their respective granular precision and recall scores.
