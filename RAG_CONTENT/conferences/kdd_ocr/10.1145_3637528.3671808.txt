Abstract
Understanding user intentions is essential for improving product
recommendations, navigation suggestions, and query reformula-
tions. However, user intentions can be intricate, involving multiple
sessions and attribute requirements connected by logical operators
such as And, Or, and Not. For instance, a user may search for Nike
or Adidas running shoes across various sessions, with a preference
for purple. In another example, a user may have purchased a mat-
tress in a previous session and is now looking for a matching bed
frame without intending to buy another mattress. Existing research
on session understanding has not adequately addressed making
product or attribute recommendations for such complex intentions.
In this paper, we present the task of logical session complex query
answering (LS-CQA), where sessions are treated as hyperedges of
items, and we frame the problem of complex intention understand-
ing as an LS-CQA task on an aggregated hypergraph of sessions,
items, and attributes. This is a unique complex query answering
task with sessions as ordered hyperedges. We also introduce a new
model, the Logical Session Graph Transformer (LSGT), which cap-
tures interactions among items across different sessions and their
logical connections using a transformer structure. We analyze the
expressiveness of LSGT and prove the permutation invariance of
the inputs for the logical operators. By evaluating LSGT on three
datasets, we demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results.

1 Introduction
Understanding user intention is a critical challenge in product
search. A user’s intention can be captured in many ways during
the product search process. Some intentions can be explicitly given
through search keywords. For example, a user may use keywords
like “Red Nike Shoes” to indicate the desired product type, brand,
and color. However, search keywords may not always accurately
reflect the user’s intention, especially when they are unsure of
what they want initially. To address this issue, session-based recom-
mendation methods have been proposed to leverage user behavior
information to make more accurate recommendations [13, 22].
User intentions are usually complex. Users often have several
explicit requirements for desired items, such as brand names, colors,
sizes, and materials. For example, in Figure 1, query 𝑞1shows a user
desiring Nike or Adidas products in the current session. On the other
hand, users may spend multiple sessions before making a purchas-
ing decision. For query 𝑞2, the user spends two sessions searching
for a desired product with an explicit requirement of purple color.
Moreover, these requirements can involve logical structures. For
instance, a user explicitly states that they do not want products
similar to a previous session. In query 𝑞3, a user has purchased a
mattress in a previous session and is now looking for a wooden
bed frame, without any intention of buying another mattress. With
the help of logical operators like AND∧,OR∨, and NOT¬, we can
describe the complex intentions by using a complex logical session
query, like𝑞1,𝑞2, and𝑞3in Figure 1.
Furthermore, there are scenarios where we are interested in
obtaining product attributes based on sessions. For example, in
query𝑞4shown in Figure 1, we aim to identify the material types
of the products desired in the session. Similarly, in query 𝑞5, when
given two sessions, we want to determine the brand names of the
products desired in both sessions. To address these scenarios, we
 
71

can describe these queries using logic expressions and variables.
For instance, we can use the variable 𝑉1to represent the products
and𝑉?to represent the attribute associated with the product 𝑉1.
As a result, the task of recommending attributes based on complex
user intentions can be formulated as logical query answering. We
inquire about the attribute 𝑉?such that there exists a product 𝑉1in
the given sessions, and the product attribute 𝑉?is desired.
To systematically answer queries with complex user intentions,
we formally propose the task of logical session complex query an-
swering (LS-CQA). This can be seen as an extension of the complex
query answering (CQA) problem to relational hypergraph data,
where sessions are treated as ordered hyperedges of items. The
task of product or attribute recommendation under complex inten-
tion is reformulated as a task of answering logical queries on an
aggregated hypergraph of sessions, items, and attributes. Figure 2
(C) provides an example of such an example, where each session is
represented as a hyperedge connecting the corresponding items.
In addition to utilizing CQA methods with N-ary facts, such as
NQE proposed by [ 26], another more reasonable approach to LS-
CQA is to employ a session encoder. Recent studies [ 17,21,44] have
shown the effectiveness of session encoders in encoding sessions
and generating session representations. However, the neural session
encoders tend to conduct implicit abstraction of products during the
session encoding process [ 44]. The logical query encoder can only
access the abstracted session representations, resulting in a lack
of capturing the interactions between items in different sessions
during the query encoding.
Motivated by this, we introduce the Logical Session Graph Trans-
former (LSGT) as an approach for encoding complex query sessions
as hypergraphs1. Building upon the work by [ 19], we transform
items, sessions, relation features, session structures, and logical
structures into tokens, and they are then encoded using a standard
transformer model. This transformation enables us to effectively
capture interactions among items in different sessions through the
any-to-any attention mechanisms in transformer models. By ana-
lyzing the Relational Weisfeiler-Lehman by [ 9,16], we provide theo-
retical justification for LSGT, demonstrating that it possesses the ex-
pressiveness of at least 1-RWL, and has at least same expressiveness
as existing logical query encoders that employ message-passing
mechanisms for logical query encoding in WL test. Meanwhile,
LSGT maintains the property of operation-wise permutation invari-
ance, similar to other logical query encoders. To evaluate LSGT, we
have conducted experiments on three evaluation datasets: Amazon,
Diginetica, and Dressipi. Results demonstrate that LSGT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. In general, the con-
tribution of this paper can be summarized as follows:
•We extend complex query answering (CQA) to hypergraphs
with sessions as ordered hyperedges (LS-CQA) for describing
and solving the product and attribute recommendations with
complex user intentions. We also constructed three corre-
sponding scaled datasets with the full support of first-order
logical operators (intersection, union, negation) for evaluat-
ing CQA models on hypergraphs with ordered hyperedges
and varied arity.
1Code available: https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/SessionCQA•We propose a new method, logical session graph transformer
(LSGT). We use tokens and identifiers to uniformly represent
the items, sessions, logical operators, and their relations.
Then we use a transformer structure to encode them.
•We conducted experiments on Amazon, Digintica, and Dres-
sipi to show that existing Transformer-based models show
similar results on 3 benchmarks despite different lineariza-
tion strategies. Meanwhile, We also find the linearization of
LSGT leads to improvements in queries with negations and
unseen query types. Meanwhile, We theoretically justify the
expressiveness in the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and the
Relational Weisfeiler-Lehman (RWL) test. We also prove the
operator-wise permutation invariance of LSGT.
2 Problem Formulation
2.1 logical session complex query Answering
In previous work, complex query answering is usually conducted
on a knowledge graph G=(V,R). However, on our aggregated
hypergraph, there are items, sessions, and attribute values. Because
of this, the graph definition is G=(V,R,S). TheVis the set of
vertices𝑣, and theRis the set of relation 𝑟. TheSis the set of
sessions regarded as directed hyperedges. To describe the relations
in logical expressions, the relations are defined in functional forms.
Each relation 𝑟is defined as a function, and each relation has two
arguments, which are two items or attributes 𝑣and𝑣′. The value
of function𝑟(𝑣,𝑣′)=1if and only if there is a relation between the
items or attributes 𝑣and𝑣′. Each session 𝑠∈Sis the sequence of
vertices where 𝑠(𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣 𝑛)=1if and only if 𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣 𝑛appeared
in the same session.
The queries are defined in the first-order logical (FOL) forms. In
a first-order logical expression, there are logical operations such
as existential quantifiers ∃, conjunctions∧, disjunctions∨, and
negations¬. In such a logical query, there are anchor items or
attribute𝑉𝑎∈V, existential quantified variables 𝑉1,𝑉2,...𝑉 𝑘∈V,
and a target variable 𝑉?∈V. The knowledge graph query is written
to find the answer 𝑉?∈V, such that there exist 𝑉1,𝑉2,...𝑉 𝑘∈V
satisfying the logical expression in the query. For each query, it
can be converted to a disjunctive normal form, where the query is
expressed as a disjunction of several conjunctive expressions:
𝑞[𝑉?]=𝑉?.∃𝑉1,...,𝑉 𝑘:𝑐1∨𝑐2∨...∨𝑐𝑛, (1)
𝑐𝑖=𝑒𝑖1∧𝑒𝑖2∧...∧𝑒𝑖𝑚. (2)
Each𝑐𝑖represents a conjunctive expression of literals 𝑒𝑖 𝑗, and each
𝑒𝑖 𝑗is an atomic or the negation of an atomic expression in any of
the following forms: 𝑒𝑖 𝑗=𝑟(𝑣𝑎,𝑉),𝑒𝑖 𝑗=¬𝑟(𝑣𝑎,𝑉),𝑒𝑖 𝑗=𝑟(𝑉,𝑉′),
or𝑒𝑖 𝑗=¬𝑟(𝑉,𝑉′). The atomics 𝑒𝑖 𝑗can be also hyper N-ary rela-
tions between vertices indicating that there exists a session among
them. In this case, the 𝑒𝑖 𝑗=𝑠(𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣 𝑛,𝑉)or its negations
𝑒𝑖 𝑗=¬𝑠(𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣 𝑛,𝑉). Here𝑣𝑎and𝑣𝑖∈𝑉𝑎is one of the an-
chor nodes, and 𝑉,𝑉′∈ {𝑉1,𝑉2,...,𝑉 𝑘,𝑉?}are distinct variables
satisfying𝑉≠𝑉′. When a query is an existential positive first-
order (EPFO) query, there are only conjunctions ∧and disjunctions
∨in the expression (no negations ¬). When the query is a conjunc-
tive query, there are only conjunctions ∧in the expressions (no
disjunctions∨and negations¬).

3.1 Hyper-Relational Graph Reasoning
The reasoning over hyper-relational KG proposed by [ 1], they ex-
tend the multi-hop reasoning problem to hyper-relational KGs and
propose a method, StarQE, to embed and answer hyper-relational
conjunctive queries using Graph Neural Networks and query em-
bedding techniques. The StarQE conducts message-passing over
the quantifier of the hyper-relations in KG, which cannot be directly
used for encoding the hyper-relations in this task. [ 26] propose a
novel Nary Query Embedding (NQE) model for complex query an-
swering over hyper-relational knowledge graphs, which can handle
more general n-ary FOL queries including existential quantifiers,
conjunction, disjunction, and negation. The encoder design of NQE
is more general to N-ary facts, thus it can be directly used for
encoding the sessions as hyper-edges.3.2 Complex Query Answering
Previous literature on logical query answering mainly focuses on
knowledge graphs [ 2–5,12,14,15,23,29,35,43]. Various methods
are proposed to deal with the incompleteness issue of knowledge
graphs by using the existing facts in the KG to generalize to the facts
that are not in the KG but highly likely to be true. Recent advances
in query embedding [ 12,29,30] methods have shown promise in
answering logical queries on large-scaled graph-structured data
effectively and efficiently. However, they cannot be directly used
for answering queries with hyperedges, or in other words N-ary
facts. Meanwhile, there are also methods [ 1,26] that can perform
robust reasoning on hyper-relational knowledge graphs, which is
illustrated in Figure 2 (B). Because of the fundamental differences
between the hyper-relational knowledge graphs and the hyper-
graphs of sessions, not all of them can be directly adopted for this
task. Recently, there is also new progress on query encoding that is

orthogonal to this paper, which puts a focus on the neural encoders
for complex queries. Xu et al . [41] propose a neural-symbolic entan-
gled method, ENeSy, for query encoding. Yang et al . [42] propose
to use Gamma Embeddings to encode complex logical queries. Liu
et al. [25] propose to use pre-training on the knowledge graph with
kg-transformer and then conduct fine-tuning on the complex query
answering. Meanwhile, query decomposition [ 2] is another way to
deal with the problem of complex query answering. In this method,
the probabilities of atomic queries are first computed by a link pre-
dictor, and then continuous optimization or beam search is used
to conduct inference time optimization. Moreover, [ 36] propose an
alternative to query encoding and query decomposition, in which
they conduct message passing on the one-hop atomics to conduct
complex query answering. Recently a novel neural search-based
method QTO [ 8] is proposed. QTO demonstrates impressive per-
formance CQA. There are also neural-symbolic query encoding
methods proposed [ 41,45]. In this line of research, their query
encoders refer back to the training knowledge graph to obtain
symbolic information from the graph. LogicRec [ 33] discusses rec-
ommending highly personalized items based on complex logical
requirements, which current recommendation systems struggle to
handle.
3.3 Session Encoders
In recent literature, various methods have been proposed to reflect
user intentions and build better recommendation systems using ses-
sion history. Because of the nature of sequence modeling, various
methods utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutions
neural networks (CNNs) to model session data [ 13,22,24,32]. Re-
cent developments in session-based recommendation have focused
on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract relationships
and better model transitions within sessions [ 11,17,21]. Wu et al .
[38] were the first to propose using GNNs to capture complex
transitions with graph structures, and subsequent research has in-
corporated position and target information, global context, and
highway networks to further improve performance [ 28,39]. How-
ever, previous efforts have focused more on the message-passing
part and less on designing effective readout operations to aggre-
gate embeddings to the session-level embedding. According to [ 44],current readout operations have limited capacity in reasoning over
sessions, and the performance improvement of GNN models is not
significant enough to justify the time and memory consumption
of sophisticated models. So [ 44] proposed a pure attention-based
method Atten-Mixer to conduct session recommendations.
4 Logical Session Graph Transformer
In this session, we describe the logical session graph transformer
(LSGT) for encoding logical queries involving sessions. In LSGT, the
node and edge features, session structures, and logical structures
are all converted into tokens and identifiers. Subsequently, they
serve as input to a standard transformer encoder model.
4.1 Items, Sessions, and Operators Tokens
The first step in LSGT involves assigning node identifiers to items,
sessions, and operators. For instance, in Figure 4, there are two ses-
sions,𝑆1and𝑆2, with items[𝑣1,𝑣2,𝑣3]and[𝑣2,𝑣3,𝑣4], respectively.
The computational graph then uses relational projection operators
𝑃1and𝑃2to find the two sets of next items desired by 𝑆1and𝑆2,
respectively. Once all items, sessions, and operators have been iden-
tified, each is assigned a unique node identifier. For example, 𝑣1
to𝑣4are assigned identifiers from 0to3,𝑆1and𝑆2are assigned
identifiers 4and5, projections from 𝑃1to𝑃3are assigned identifiers
from 6to8, and intersection operation 𝐼1is assigned to 9.
In general, when there are 𝑛nodes denoted by their identifiers as
{𝑝0,𝑝1,...,𝑝 𝑛}, their node features are assigned as follows: if 𝑝𝑖is an
item, its features are assigned to its item embedding. If 𝑝𝑖is a session
𝑆𝑗, it is assigned an embedding of [S]. If𝑝𝑖is a neural operator,
it is assigned the operator embedding from [P],[I],[N], or[U]
based on its operation type. The feature matrix for these 𝑛nodes
is then denoted as 𝑿𝑝∈R𝑛×𝑑1. Additionally, each node identifier
is associated with random orthonormal vectors [ 19], denoted as
𝑷𝑝∈R𝑛×𝑑2. All nodes are assigned the type identifier of [node] ,
which means that they are the nodes in the computational graph.
The token type embedding for vertices is denoted as 𝑇[𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒]∈
R𝑑3. The input vectors for the transformer are concatenations of
node features, the random orthonormal vectors, and token type
 
74Understanding Inter-Session Intentions via Complex Logical Reasoning KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
embeddings, where node identifiers vectors are repeated twice:
𝑿𝑣𝑢=[𝑿𝑝,𝑷𝑝,𝑷𝑝,𝑻[𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒]]∈R𝑛×(𝑑 1+2𝑑2+𝑑3).
4.2 Session Structure Tokens
In this part, we describe the process of constructing the input to-
kens to indicate the session structure, namely which items are in
which session in which position. Suppose the item 𝑝is from session
𝑞and at the position of 𝑟, and there are 𝑚item-session correspon-
dences in total. First, we use positional encoding 𝑃𝑜𝑠(r)∈R𝑑1to
describe the positional information. Meanwhile, as the item and
sessions are associated with their node identifiers 𝑝and𝑞, we
use the node identifier vectors 𝑃𝑝∈R𝑑2and𝑃𝑞∈R𝑑2to rep-
resent them. Meanwhile, this token represents a correspondence
between two nodes, so we use the [edge] token type embedding
to describe this 𝑇[𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒]∈R𝑑3. As there are in total 𝑚of item-
session correspondences, we concatenate them together to obtain
the input vectors for the tokens representing session structures:
𝑿𝑠
(𝑝,𝑞,𝑟)=[𝑃𝑜𝑠(r),𝑷𝑝,𝑷𝑞,𝑻[𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒]]∈R𝑚×(𝑑 1+2𝑑2+𝑑3).
4.3 Logical Structure Tokens
In this part, we describe the process of constructing the input for
tokens to indicate the logical structures. As shown in Figure 4, in
an edge representing a logical operation, there are two nodes 𝑝
and𝑞respectively. If the logical operation is projection, then the
edge feature is assigned with relation embedding [Rel] . Otherwise,
the edge feature is assigned with the operation embedding from
[P],[I],[N], and [U]accordingly. The edge feature is denoted as
𝑅𝑟∈R𝑑1. Similarly, we use the node identifier vectors 𝑃𝑝∈R𝑑2
and𝑃𝑞∈R𝑑2to represent involved nodes 𝑝and𝑞. Meanwhile, this
token represents an edge in the computational graph, so we also
associate it with token type embedding 𝑇[𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒]∈R𝑑3to describe it.
Suppose there are in total 𝑤such logical edges, we concatenate them
together to obtain the input vectors for the tokens representing
logical structure: 𝑿𝑙
(𝑝,𝑞,𝑟)=[𝑹𝑟,𝑷𝑝,𝑷𝑞,𝑻[𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒]]∈R𝑤×(𝑑 1+2𝑑2+𝑑3).
4.4 Training LSGT
After obtaining the three parts describing the items, session struc-
tures, and logical structures, we concatenate them together 𝑿=
[𝑋[graph],𝑿𝑣,𝑿𝑠,𝑿𝑙]∈𝑅(𝑚+𝑛+𝑤+1)×(𝑑 1+2𝑑2+𝑑3), and use this ma-
trix as the input for a standard transformer encoder for compute
the query encoding of this complex logical session query. Then
we append a special token [graph] with embedding 𝑋[graph]∈
R𝑑1+2𝑑2+𝑑3at the beginning of the transformer and use the token
output of the [graph] token as the embedding of the complex
logical session query. To train the LSGT model, we compute the
normalized probability of the vertice 𝑎being the correct answer of
query𝑞by using the softmax function on all similarity scores,
𝑝(𝑞,𝑎)=𝑒<𝑒𝑞,𝑒𝑎>
Í
𝑎′∈𝑉𝑒<𝑒𝑞,𝑒𝑎′>. (3)
Then we construct a cross-entropy loss to maximize the log proba-
bilities of all correct pairs:

4.5 Theoretical Properties of LSGT
In this part, we analyze the theoretical properties of LSGT, focusing
on two perspectives. First, we analyze the expressiveness of LSGT
compared to baseline methods in Theorem 1 and 2. Second, we an-
alyze whether LSGT has operator-wise permutation invariant, and
this is important in query encoding as operators like Intersection
andUnion are permutation invariant to inputs in Theorem 3. We
prove the following theorems in the Appendix A of LSGT:
Theorem 1. When without considering the relation types in the
query graph, the expressiveness of the LSGT encoder is at least the
same as that of the encoder that combines a session encoder followed
by a logical query encoder under Weisfeiler-Lehman tests[27].
Theorem 2. When considering the query graphs are multi-relational
graphs with edge relation types, the expressiveness of the LSGT en-
coder is also at least as powerful as 1-RWL, namely the expressiveness
of R-GCN and CompGCN [9, 16].
Theorem 3. LSGT can approximate a logical query encoding
model that is operator-wise input permutation invariant.

5 Experiment
We use three public datasets from KDD-Cup2[18], Diginetica3,
and Dressipi4for evaluation. The number of items, sessions, and
relations are reported in Table 1. Following previous work [ 7,30,37],
we use eighty percent of the edges for training, ten percent of
edges for validation, and the rest of the edges as testing edges. As
shown in Figure 5, we conduct sampling of fourteen types of logical
session queries by using the sampling algorithm described by [ 7].
The number of queries is shown in Table 7. Each of the queries
has a concrete meaning. For example, the 1p queries are vanilla
session-based product recommendations, and the 2p queries aim to
recommend product attributes based on a single session history. A
detailed explanation of the query types is shown in Appendix B.

We briefly introduce the baseline query encoding models that
use various neural networks to encode the query into embedding
structures. Here are the baseline models for the complex query-
answering models:
•NQE [ 26] is a method that can be used to encode N-ary facts
from the KG;
•SQE [ 7] uses sequence encoders to encode linearized complex
queries.
In the hyper-relational session-product-attribute graph, each
session can be formulated as a directed hyper-relation among var-
ious entities. Because of this, we construct the relation of NEXT
connecting the items that are browsed in the session following
the corresponding order. We employed a state-of-the-art session
encoder to model the item history within a session. The session
encoder takes into account the temporal dependencies and context
of products, effectively creating a contextual representation of the
entire session:

•Q2P [6] uses multiple vectors to encode the queries;
•FuzzQE [10] use fuzzy logic to represent logical operators.
Meanwhile, the previous query encoder cannot be directly used
for encoding session history as hyper-relations, so we incorporate
them with session encoders. For the session encoders, we leverage
the following session encoders:
•Sequence-based encoder GRURec [31];
•GNN-based session encoder SR-GNN [38];
•Attention-based session encoder Attention-Mixer [44].

ing query andG𝑣𝑎𝑙,G𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡to represent the validation and the test-
ing knowledge graph. Here we use [𝑞]𝑣𝑎𝑙and[𝑞]𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡to represent
the answers of query 𝑞on the validation graph G𝑣𝑎𝑙and testing
graphG𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡respectively. Equation 5 describes how to compute the
Inference metrics. When the evaluation metric is mean reciprocalranking (MRR), then the 𝑚(𝑟)is defined as 𝑚(𝑟)=1

5.3 Experiment Details
We maintain a consistent hidden size of 384for all models. This hid-
den size also corresponds to the size of session representation from
session encoders in the baselines, as well as the query embedding
size for the entire logical session query. We use the AdamW to train
the models with a batch size of 512. The models are optimized with
a learning rate of 0.001, except for those with transformer struc-
tures, namely NQE, SQE-Transformer, and LSGT. These models are
trained with a learning rate of 0.0001 with a warm-up of 10000
steps. The SQE and LSGT models employ two layers of encoders.
All models can be trained on GPU with 24GB memory.

5.4 Experiment Results
Table 2 compares the performance of different models with various
backbones and configurations. Based on the experimental results,
we can draw the following conclusions.
We found that the proposed LSGT method not only outperforms
all other models but also represents the current state-of-the-art
for the task. In comparison to models that solely rely on session
encoders followed by query encoders, LSGT possesses the ability to
leverage item information across different sessions, which proves to
be critical for achieving superior performance. Additionally, LSGT
demonstrates better capability in encoding graph structural induc-
tive bias due to its operation-wise permutation invariance property,
resulting in improved performance compared to other transformer-
based models like SQE.
We compare the baseline of SQE [ 7] in Tables 2 and 3, which
uses a simple prefix linearization strategy [ 20] to represent logical
queries. However, because SQE is doing sequence modeling instead
of graph modeling, it is not permutation invariant to logical oper-
ations, and thus cannot perform well in the query types that aresensitive to logical graph structure, like negation queries (Table 3)
and out-of-distribution queries (Table 5).
Furthermore, LSGT exhibits greater effectiveness in handling
queries involving negations when compared to the baseline models.
It achieves more significant improvements on negation queries than
on EPFO queries, surpassing the performance of the best baseline.
For2isandipquery types, the any-to-any attention mechanism
may not be necessary as the session embedding adequately reflects
the "concentrated" intentions. However, for multi-hop questions
involving negations and disjunctions, the any-to-any mechanisms
demonstrate advantages. In the Dressipi dataset, query types ask-
ing for attribute values, such as ip,pi, and others, consistently
yield high performances. Compared to other datasets, which cover
broad domains, the Dressipi dataset focuses specifically on dress-
ing, consequently leading to a low diversity of attribute values. All
the reasoning model performances reflect this property, thereby
strengthening the validity of the query sampling and dataset con-
struction.
Moreover, our observations indicate that neural models can gen-
erate more accurate results when presented with additional infor-
mation or constraints. This highlights the significance of effectively
modeling complex user intentions and underscores the potential
for enhancing service quality in real-world usage scenarios.
5.5 Compositional Generalization
We conducted additional experiments on compositional general-
ization, and the results are presented in Table 5. In this particular
setting, we evaluated the performance of our model on query types
that were not encountered during the training process. These query
types, namely 3iA,3ip,3inA , and 3inp (as illustrated in Fig. 5),
were selected due to their complexity, involving three anchors, en-
compassing both EPFO queries and queries with negations, and
incorporating 1-hop and 2-hop relational projections in the reason-
ing process. These query types were not included in the training
data and were evaluated in a zero-shot manner.
By comparing the performance of our proposed method with the
baselines, we observed that our approach demonstrated stronger
compositional generalization on these previously unseen query
types. Across the three datasets, our method improves in Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) ranging from 1.28 to 3.22.
 
78Understanding Inter-Session Intentions via Complex Logical Reasoning KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
5.6 Ablation Study
The results of the ablation study are presented in Table 4. In the
first ablation study, we removed the tokens that represent the logi-
cal structures, and in the second ablation study, we eliminated the
order information within the hypergraph by excluding the posi-
tional encoding features of item tokens in each session. When we
removed the logical structure information, a significant drop in the
model’s performance was observed, particularly for queries involv-
ing negations and multi-hop reasoning, such as ip,pi,inp, and pin.
Without the logical structure, the model was restricted to utilizing
co-occurrence information, such as "bag of sessions" and "bag of
items," for ranking candidate answers. While this information may
be useful for simple structured queries, its effectiveness diminished
for complex structured queries. Likewise, when we removed the
order information within each session, a notable decrease in the
overall performance was observed. This highlights two important
findings: First, the item orders within each session play a crucial
role in this task. Second, the LSGT model effectively utilizes the
order information for this specific task.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a framework that models user intent
as a complex logical query over a hyper-relational graph that de-
scribes sessions, products, and their attributes. Our framework
formulates the session understanding problem as a logical session
complex query answering (LS-CQA) on this graph and trains com-
plex query-answering models to make recommendations based on
the logical queries. We also introduced a novel method of logical
session graph transformer (LSGT) and demonstrated its expressive-
ness and operator-wise permutation invariance. Our evaluation
of fourteen intersection logical reasoning tasks showed that our
proposed framework achieves better results on unseen queries and
queries involving negations. Overall, our framework provides a
flexible and effective approach for modeling user intent and mak-
ing recommendations in e-commerce scenarios. Future work could
extend our approach to other domains and incorporate additional
sources of information to improve recommendation accuracy.

A Proofs
We give the proofs of Theorem 1, 2, and Theorem 3. Before
proving these two theorems, we define the proxy graph of the
graph we used in this paper that involves N-ary facts.
Defintion (Proxy Graph). For each computational graph utilized
by the query encoder, we can uniquely identify the corresponding
proxy graph. This graph comprises binary edges without hyper-
edges and consists of vertices representing items, sessions, and
operators. The edges in the proxy graph can be categorized into
three types: session edges, which connect item vertices to session
vertices and utilize their position, such as 1,2,...,𝑘 as edge types;
relational projection edges, which connect two vertices and em-
ploy the relation type as the edge type; and logical edges, which
utilize the corresponding logical operation type as the edge type. It
is important to note that the proxy graph is distinct for different
computational graphs with N-ary facts.
Defintion (Non-relational Argumented Proxy Graph). For each
proxy graph, we create another graph called a Non-relational Argu-
mented Proxy Graph. This graph includes all vertices in the original
proxy. Meanwhile, the argument graph an additional node for each
edge in the original graph, and it takes relation type as a node
feature.
Lemma 1. Encoding the complex session query by following the
computational graph using a session encoder followed by query encod-
ing is equivalent to performing message passing on the corresponding
proxy graph.
Proof. To prove this, we must analyze each operation in the
original N-ary computational graph. For the session encoder part,
the session representation is computed from the items it contains,
which is equivalent to a message passing on the proxy graph with
a unique aggregation function, namely the session encoder. For the
intersection and union operations, the computational graph utilizes
various specially designed logical operations to encode them, and
they can be considered as messages passing over the proxy graph.Similarly, for the relational projection, the tail node aggregates
information from the head node and relation type, which is also a
message-passing process on the proxy graph. □
Lemma 2. The encoding process of LSGT is equivalent to using
TokenGT to encode the proxy graph.
Proof. The encoding process of LSGT consists of three parts.
First, the node tokens are used to identify and represent the items,
sessions, and operators. Secondly, the logical structure tokens are
employed to represent the logical connections between items and
sessions. Finally, LSGT utilizes positional embedding as the token
feature to describe the positional information of an item in a session.
This process is equivalent to building an edge between the item
and session and assigning its edge feature as the corresponding
position embedding, which is done in the proxy graph. Therefore,
encoding logical session graphs using LSGT is equivalent to using
TokenGT on the proxy graph. □
Lemma 3. Suppose the 𝐺1and𝐺2are two proxy graphs, and 𝐺′
1
and𝐺′
2are two non-relational argument proxy graphs converted from
𝐺1and𝐺2respectively. Then 𝐺1=𝐺2←→𝐺′
1=𝐺′
2.
Proof. The direction 𝐺1=𝐺2→𝐺′
1=𝐺′
2is trivial because
according to the definition, the conversion process is deterministic.
We focus on the reverse side: 𝐺1=𝐺2←𝐺′
1=𝐺′
2. We try to
prove it by contradiction. Suppose 𝐺1≠𝐺2but𝐺′
1=𝐺′
2. Without
losing generality, we can suppose there is an edge (𝑢,𝑣,𝑟)∈𝐺1
but(𝑢,𝑣,𝑟)is not in𝐺2where𝑢,𝑣are vertices and 𝑟is the relation.
Because of this, suppose 𝑤is a node with feature 𝑟connected that is
linked to both 𝑢,𝑣in the argument graph for both 𝐺′
1=𝐺′
2. Namely
both(𝑢,𝑤)and(𝑤,𝑣)are in𝐺′
1=𝐺′
2. Because the(𝑢,𝑣,𝑟)is not in
𝐺2,(𝑤,𝑣)is not constructed by the edge (𝑢,𝑣,𝑟), thus it must be
constructed by another edge (𝑢′,𝑣,𝑟). This suggests 𝑤is connected
with at least three vertices 𝑢,𝑣and𝑢′. This is contradictory to the
definition of the non-relational argument proxy graph. □
Proof of Theorem 1.
Proof. Based on Lemma 1, as the baseline models perform mes-
sage passing on the proxy graph, their expressiveness is as powerful
as the 1-WL graph isomorphism test [ 40]. Additionally, according to
Lemma 1, the encoding process of LSGT on the session query graph
is equivalent to using order-2 TokenGT on the proxy graph. Order-2
TokenGT can approximate the 2-IGN network [ 19], and the 2-IGN
network is at least as expressive as the 2-WL graph isomorphism
test [ 27]. Since the 2-WL test is equivalent to the 1-WL test, we
can conclude that LSGT has at least the same expressiveness as the
baseline models.
□
Proof of Theorem 2.
Proof. To prove the expressiveness of LSGT on the multirela-
tional proxy graph is at least 1-RWL, we need to show that for two
non-isomorphic multi-relational graphs 𝐺and𝐻, if they can be
distinguished by 1-RWL or equivalently CompGCN, then it also
can be distinguished by LSGT.
According to the CompGCN definition and the definition of
the Non-Relational Argument Proxy Graph of 𝐺′and𝐻′which

are constructed from 𝐺and𝐻respectively, CompGCN computed
on𝐺and𝐻can be regarded as a message passing on the non-
relational message passing on 𝐺′and𝐻′. We will give a more
detailed justification as follows.
The formula of CompGCN [34] is as follows:
ℎ𝑘+1
𝑣=𝑓(∑︁
(𝑢,𝑟)∈𝑁(𝑣)𝑊𝑘
𝜆(𝑟)𝜙(ℎ𝑘
𝑢,ℎ𝑘
𝑟)), (6)
hereℎ𝑘𝑢,ℎ𝑘𝑟denotes features for node 𝑢and relation 𝑟at the
𝑘-th layer respectively, ℎ𝑘+1𝑣denotes the updated representation of
node𝑣, and𝑊𝜆(𝑟)∈R𝑑×𝑑is a relation-type specific parameter. 𝑓
is an activation function (such as the ReLU ). In CompGCN, we use
direction-specific weights, i.e., 𝜆(𝑟)=𝑑𝑖𝑟(𝑟).
On the other hand, the general form of non-relational message
passing is expressed as follows:
ℎ𝑘+1
𝑣=𝛾𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑣,Ê
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑣)𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑣,ℎ𝑘
𝑢)), (7)
Where denotes in the 𝑘-th layer, theÉis a differentiable, permuta-
tion invariant function, e.g., sum, mean or max, and 𝛾and𝜓denote
differentiable functions such as MLPs (Multi Layer Perceptrons).
With these two formulas we are going to prove the CompGCN
computed on relational graph 𝐺with Equation (6) is equivalent
to a message passing on the non-relational argumented graph 𝐺′
with Equation (7). To prove this, we can use a constructive method
to show that each step of CompGCN with equation (6) on 𝐺is
identical to two steps message passing on 𝐺′with equation (7).
Suppose for each edge (𝑢,𝑣)in graph𝐺, there is a in-between node
𝑤with node label of relation type 𝑟in the augmented graph 𝐺′. The
computation of equation 6 can be separated into the following two
steps. First for each neighbor 𝑢of𝑣, we use𝑔𝑘𝑢,𝑟to represent the
result of the result of a composition of the following two functions:
𝑔𝑘
𝑢,𝑟=𝜙(ℎ𝑘
𝑢,ℎ𝑘
𝑟) (8)

Then we are going to prove that these two steps each equivalent
to one message passing step on the argumented graph 𝐺′. First we
show the equation 8 is equivalent to a message passing process
on𝐺′to the augmented node 𝑤that contains the relation feature
ℎ𝑤=ℎ𝑟between𝑢and𝑣. We can let the 𝛾𝑘+1(𝑥,𝑦)=𝑦and𝜓𝑘+1(𝑥,𝑦)=𝜙(𝑦,𝑥)in the general message passing in equation 7,
and we got the following equation
ℎ𝑘+1
𝑤=𝛾𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,Ê
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,ℎ𝑘
𝑢)) (10)
=Ê
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,ℎ𝑘
𝑢) (11)
=𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,ℎ𝑘
𝑢)=𝜙(ℎ𝑘
𝑢,ℎ𝑘
𝑤) (12)
=𝜙(ℎ𝑘
𝑢,ℎ𝑘
𝑟)=𝑔𝑘
𝑢,𝑟 (13)
Then, we show that in the second step of CompGCN in equation
9 is equivalent to another step of message passing in 𝐺′from each
of its neighbors 𝑤to𝑣. According to the Equation 7, we can write
ℎ𝑘+1
𝑣=𝛾𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑣,Ê
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,ℎ𝑘
𝑢)) (14)
=𝑓(Ê
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,ℎ𝑘
𝑢)) (15)
=𝑓(∑︁
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝜓𝑘+1(ℎ𝑘
𝑤,ℎ𝑘
𝑢)) (16)
=𝑓(∑︁
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝑊𝑘
𝜆(𝑟)ℎ𝑘
𝑤) (17)
=𝑓(∑︁
𝑢∈𝑁(𝑤)𝑊𝑘
𝜆(𝑟)𝑔𝑘
𝑢,𝑟). (18)
As a result, the CompGCN over 𝐺is able to write as two steps of
message passing over the augmented graph 𝐺′.
Thus, if𝐺and𝐻can be distinguished by CompGCN, then 𝐺′
and𝐻′can be distinguished by a certain non-relational message-
passing algorithm. Thus 𝐺′and𝐻′can be distinguished by the
1-WL test. As Shown in previous proof LSGT is at least as powerful
as the 2-WL test, and 1-WL and 2-WL tests are equivalent. We can
conclude that LSGT is able to distinguish 𝐺′and𝐻′. According to
Lemma 3, if LSGT is able to distinguish 𝐺′and𝐻′then it is able to
distinguish𝐺and𝐻.

Proof of Theorem 3.
Proof. Operation-wise permutation invariance mainly focuses
on the Intersection andUnion operations. Suppose the input
vertices for such an operator are {𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝 𝑛}. If an arbitrary
permutation over these vertices is denoted as {𝑝′
1,𝑝′
2,...,𝑝′𝑛}, a
global permutation of token identifiers can be constructed, where
vertices𝑝𝑖are mapped to 𝑝′
𝑖and the rest are mapped to themselves.
As per Lemma 2, LSGT can approximate 2-IGN [ 27], which is permu-
tation invariant. Therefore, LSGT can approximate a query encoder
that achieves operation-wise permutation invariance. □
