ABSTRACT
Modern e-commerce platforms rely heavily on modeling diverse
user feedback to provide personalized services. Consequently, multi-
task learning has become an integral part of their ranking systems.
However, existing multi-task learning methods encounter two main
challenges: some lack explicit modeling of task relationships, result-
ing in inferior performance, while others have limited applicability
due to being computationally intensive, having scalability issues,
or relying on strong assumptions. To address these limitations and
better fit our real-world scenario, pre-rank in Shopee Search, we
introduce in this paper ResFlow, a lightweight multi-task learning
framework that enables efficient cross-task information sharing
via residual connections between corresponding layers of task net-
works. Extensive experiments on datasets from various scenarios
and modalities demonstrate its superior performance and adaptabil-
ity over state-of-the-art methods. The online A/B tests in Shopee
Search showcase its practical value in large-scale industrial ap-
plications, evidenced by a 1.29% increase in OPU (order-per-user)
without additional system latency. ResFlow is now fully deployed
in the pre-rank module of Shopee Search. To facilitate efficient
online deployment, we propose a novel offline metric Weighted Re-
call@K, which aligns well with our online metric OPU, addressing
the longstanding online-offline metric misalignment issue. Besides,
we propose to fuse scores from the multiple tasks additively when
ranking items, which outperforms traditional multiplicative fusion.

1 INTRODUCTION
Modern large-scale recommender systems and search engines heav-
ily rely on modeling diverse user feedback to understand the pref-
erences of users and better provide personalized services. Specifi-
cally, for e-commerce platforms like Meituan [ 31], AliExpress [ 15],
Taobao [ 18], Walmart [ 30], and Shopee, estimating the click-through
rate (CTR) and the click-through & conversion rate (CTCVR) of
a user w.r.t. items have become one of their primary tasks. These
metrics serve as their main indicators when ranking items.
Given that these estimation tasks are closely related and that
high-commitment user behaviors exhibit significant sparsity, e.g.,
CTCVR is typically at the level of 0.1%, multi-task learning (MTL) [ 36,
39] has become an integral part of such systems to boost cross-task
information interchange and mitigate the sample sparsity issue.
However, real-world large-scale e-commerce platforms have
unique features that make MTL for their ranking systems special
and challenging. Firstly, large-scale ranking systems commonly use
a multi-stage candidate selection framework [ 28,38], e.g., match 
pre-rank rank, to strike a balance between efficiency and accu-
racy, as depicted in Figure 1. In the early stages, such as pre-rank,
the system must quickly sort through millions of items with limited
resources, shortlisting a manageable number of candidates that

feedback. It sketches the quantities of samples at each stage,

align well with user interests and search keywords for the next
stage. This requirement poses a significant challenge to the effi-
ciency of model inference, forbidding the employment of complex
models. Secondly, user actions in e-commerce platforms are typi-
cally designed to be carried out progressively, e.g., users can only
place an order after clicking the item. Effective leverage of such
sequential dependence properties may have critical importance.
Among the mainstream multi-task learning methods, MMOE [ 17]
and PLE [ 22] foster cross-task information sharing through expert-
based network architectures. However, they lack explicit modeling
of task relationships, showing relatively inferior performance [ 31].
Towards leveraging the sequential dependence among tasks, AITM
[31] proposed to transfer information sequentially from the for-
mer task to the latter via an attention-based module. However, its
high computational intensity limits its applicability in resource-
constrained scenarios like pre-rank.
On the other hand, ESMM [ 18] proposed to use causal graphs
to model sequentially dependent tasks, modeling the conditional
probability of the latter step given the former. Thereafter, given the
inherent sample selection bias [ 5] of modeling condition probability,
subsequent methods including ESCM2[27] and DCMT [ 40] further
employed counterfactual regularizers [ 24] to mitigate this issue.
However, they encounter scalability issues when extending beyond
two tasks, due to the high variance associated with counterfactual
regularizers and their accumulation along the causal dependency
chain [ 27]. Besides, the applicability of these causal methods is
limited to scenarios where clear causal relationships exist.
To address the aforementioned limitations and better fit our real-
world scenario, we propose ResFlow, a lightweight multi-task learn-
ing framework that boosts efficient information transfer from one
task to another by introducing a set of residual connections between
corresponding layers of their networks. ResFlow is hence generally
applicable in situations where the information from the former
task is beneficial to the latter [ 13,26,30,31], typically from low-
commitment, dense tasks to high-commitment, sparser ones, includ-
ing sequentially dependent cases, e.g., "click" "order", and more
general ones where tasks show certain progressiveness, e.g., "like"
and "forward". It is worth noting that such residual connections
can be straightforwardly extended to longer progressive chains,e.g., "click" "add-to-cart" "order", fostering a sufficient and
continuous flow of information, as illustrated in Figure 2. With its
simplicity and generality, ResFlow can be integrated smoothly into
diverse ranking stages and application scenarios.
Comprehensive experiments on various offline datasets, as well
as online A/B tests in Shopee Search, have validated the superb
effectiveness and scalability of ResFlow. In particular, according
to our online A/B tests, ResFlow brings a 1.29% increase in OPU
(order-per-user) without extra system latency. ResFlow is now fully
deployed in the pre-rank module of Shopee Search.
Furthermore, to facilitate efficient online deployment, we pro-
pose a new offline metric Weighted Recall@K, which aligns well
with our online metric OPU, addressing the longstanding issue of
online-offline metric misalignment. Besides, we propose to fuse the
scores from the multiple tasks additively when ranking items, which
according to our experiments consistently outperforms traditional
multiplicative score fusion.
The contribution of this paper can be summarized as:
•We propose ResFlow, a novel, lightweight, and versatile MTL
framework, demonstrating its superior performance and adapt-
ability over state-of-the-art methods and fully deploying it in the
pre-rank module of Shopee Search.
•We propose a new offline metric that addresses the longstanding
online-offline metric alignment issues in practical deployment.
We propose to additively fuse multi-task scores when ranking
items, which outperforms traditional multiplicative score fusion.
2 RELATED WORKS
Multi-task learning, originating from Caruana’s work [ 3], has evolved
through various techniques [ 20,32,35,37]. Its application in e-
commerce has recently seen a significant increase, which can be
mainly categorized into: 1) parameter-sharing based [ 7,17,22]; 2)
feature information transfer based [ 13,26,30,31]; and 3) proba-
bility transfer based [ 18,27,40]. ResFlow aligns with the feature
information transfer category.
Our online tests are conducted within the pre-rank module of a
multi-stage candidate selection framework [ 28,38]. Specific stage
focused works include: DeepMatch [ 11] and DSSM [ 16] for match
stage, Wang et al . [28] and Zhang et al . [38] for pre-rank stage. Joint
optimization across different stages has also been explored [ 8,21].
ResFlow adopted the residual learning concept, a principle estab-
lished by ResNet [ 10]. Various studies [ 14,23] have investigated its
effectiveness, and it remains popular in diverse applications, such
as ControlNet [ 34] in diffusion model control and LoRA [ 33] in
large language model adaptation.
Some tasks in applied ranking, e.g., the CTCVR estimation, con-
front severe sample imbalance issues. Besides employing multi-task
learning, among the typical single-task solutions, such as sampling-
based [ 1], cost-sensitive [ 4,19], and kernel-based [ 29], we further
adopt the sampling-based, implemented as sample re-weighting,
for its simplicity and compatibility with neural networks.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we introduce the proposed multi-task learning frame-
work ResFlow. As illustrated in Figure 2, it boosts efficient infor-
mation transfer from one task to another by introducing residual

CTR, the click-through rate; ATCR, the post-view add-to-cart rate; CTCVR, the click-through & conversion rate. AITM extracts
information from the last feature layer of the former task, transferring it to the latter via an attention-based module. ESMM
models the (conditional) probability of each step, estimating ATCR and CTCVR based on the products of these probabilities.
ResFlow builds residual connections between corresponding layers among tasks, enabling information transfer sufficiently at
various levels in an additive manner, which is not only extremely lightweight but also shows distinguished effectiveness.
connections between corresponding layers of their networks at var-
ious levels. ResFlow is generally applicable if only the information
from the former task is beneficial to the latter.
Typical application scenarios include sequentially dependent
tasks, e.g., "click" "add-to-cart" "order", and tasks that show cer-
tain progressiveness, e.g., "view", "like" and "forward". Note that, for
information boost, it is typically connected from low-commitment,
dense tasks to high-commitment, sparser ones (see Section 4.5).
3.1 Multi-Task Optimization
Given a set of related tasks, multi-task learning typically optimizes
a joint loss that is a weighted sum of the loss from each task:
𝐿(𝜗,𝜃1,...,𝜃𝐾)=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝜔𝑘𝐿𝑘(𝜗,𝜃𝑘), (1)
where𝐾denotes the number of tasks, 𝜔𝑘and𝜃𝑘denote the loss
weight and the task-specific parameters of task 𝑘respectively, 𝜗
denote the possible parameters that shared across tasks, and 𝐿𝑘
denotes the loss of task 𝑘. More specifically,
𝐿𝑘(𝜗,𝜃𝑘)=∑︁
𝑖𝛿𝑘(𝑦𝑖
𝑘,ˆ𝑦𝑖
𝑘(𝜗,𝜃𝑘,𝑥𝑖
𝑘)), (2)
where𝛿𝑘denotes the loss function, e.g., cross-entropy, of task 𝑘,
𝑦𝑖
𝑘and ˆ𝑦𝑖
𝑘respectively denote the target and the prediction of 𝑥𝑖
𝑘,
the𝑖-th sample of task 𝑘.
3.2 ResFlow Architecture
The core element of ResFlow is the residual connections between
corresponding layers among tasks, which are also the only extra
things that need to be introduced when employing ResFlow.The residual connection here is a generalized one, which links
a position in one task network to a position in another task net-
work, diverging from the traditional pattern, e.g., in He et al . [10]
where such connections are within a single network. It allows for
information transfer from the former position to the latter through
element-wise addition of their values.
Notably, residual connections are directional, it is hence required
to ascertain the task relationships and determine how the tasks
should be chained beforehand. Regardless, for sequentially depen-
dent tasks, we just need to follow its dependence chain. More gen-
eral cases will be studied in the experiments (Section 4.5).
Besides, a logically reasonable residual connection would require
its two endpoints to have a certain correspondence. ResFlow hence
requires that the task networks to be residually connected have an
analogous structural topology, to facilitate sensible constructions
of residual connections between their corresponding points that
share the same functionality and dimensionality.
For clarity, we here formally discuss the setting where the net-
works for each task are of the same sequential (i.e., with no branch)
architecture, e.g., the same multilayer perceptron (MLP), while
illustrating some more complex settings in Appendix A.
Assume that each task network consists of 𝐿sequentially chained
function blocks, denoted by 𝑓𝑙
𝑘with 1≤𝑙≤𝐿and1≤𝑘≤𝐾
respectively. A function block can simply be a linear transformation
followed by a nonlinear activation, while more complex structures
are equally applicable. In particular, the output of the last function
block would be of the target dimension, typically a scalar.
Denoting the output of the 𝑙-th block (after residual, if has) of
the𝑘-th task as𝑜𝑙
𝑘, if the(𝑘−1)-th task is residually connected with
the𝑘-th task and there is a link behind the 𝑙-th function block, then:
𝑜𝑙
𝑘=𝑜𝑙
𝑘−1+𝑓𝑙
𝑘(𝑜𝑙−1
𝑘), (3)
4976KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Cong Fu et al.
otherwise, it will simply be:
𝑜𝑙
𝑘=𝑓𝑙
𝑘(𝑜𝑙−1
𝑘), (4)
where𝑜0
𝑘refers to the input of task 𝑘.
Essentially, having a residual link behind would redefine 𝑓𝑙
𝑘as
a residual learner that learns to yield 𝑜𝑙
𝑘additively based on the
output𝑜𝑙
𝑘−1from the former task. Making use of the feature learned
by the former task, which typically has denser positive feedback,
could make the latter’s learning easier. Otherwise, it needs to learn
fully by itself to generate 𝑜𝑙
𝑘.
To seek a maximum information transfer, such residual links can
be employed behind all function blocks of chained task networks,
including the final ones that output the logits, as in Figure 2. Ac-
cording to our experiments, all of these connections are beneficial.
With these residual connections, ResFlow enables transferring
information effectively and sufficiently at various levels, leading to
improved performance. The additional residual connections come
with minimal extra computational overhead and thus can be used
in various scenarios, including those with limited computational
resources like pre-rank. Without leveraging any harsh prior knowl-
edge, it is generally applicable for joint learning of tasks where the
information from one task benefits another.
3.3 Implementation Details
Although ResFlow can be generally applicable, task definitions can
still be important. For example, one can choose to build a task to
directly model CTCVR, but given there is an auxiliary CTR task,
one can also choose to model CTCVR indirectly via modeling its
probability condition on the estimated CTR, like ESMM [ 18]. Ac-
cording to our experiments, with ResFlow, direct modeling leads
to better performance than modeling the conditional. Apart from
the sample selection bias issue in modeling conditional probability
[5,27,40], direct modeling of CTCVR could offer better progressive-
ness upon the CTR task, making residual connections in-between
more acceptable. From another perspective, residual learning could
play the role of additively encoding in the conditional probabilities.
For sequentially dependent actions, when modeling the probabil-
ities of progressing from the outset to each of the later stages, their
predicted probability should be strictly non-increasing by definition.
According to our experiments, in most e-commerce scenarios, we
need no extra regularization to ensure this. They will be naturally
satisfied after training, possibly due to the ground-truth probabil-
ities having very sharp decreases within each step. Nevertheless,
we tested a set of regularizers for this purpose. Among them, forc-
ing the residual logit, i.e., the output of final block 𝑓𝐿
𝑘(𝑜𝐿−1
𝑘), to be
non-positive by taking a min between it and zero, gives the best per-
formance, which is very stable, shows no harm to the performance,
and can bring improvements in some cases.

4.1.1 Datasets. The datasets considered include: 1) AliCCP, from
real-world traffic logs of the recommender system in Taobao [ 18],
and its scenario-splits S0, S1, S0&S1; 2) AE, from real-world traffic
logs of the search system in AliExpress [ 15], comprising country-
wise subsets AE-RU, AE-ES, AE-FR, AE-NL, and AE-US; 3) Shopee,
a private dataset from traffic logs of the primary search scenario in
Shopee, collected within 10 consecutive days; 4) KuaiRand-Pure-S1,
the main scenario of the multi-scenario user interaction dataset
collected from the primary recommender system of Kuaishou [ 9]; 5)
MovieLens-1M, a widely used movie ratings dataset. Their statistics
are provided in Table 1, 2, and 3.
In particular, the Shopee dataset has three types of labels: click,
add-to-cart, and conversion. Shopee-2 indicates results on using
only the click and conversion labels, i.e., there are two tasks, CTR
and CTCVR estimation, while Shopee-3 indicates results using all
three labels with three estimation tasks, CTR, ATCR, and CTCVR.

KuaiRand-Pure-S1 and MovieLens-1M are used to attest Res-
Flow’s applicability to more general scenarios and other modalities.
4.1.2 Baseline Methods. The baseline methods considered in our
experiments include: ESMM [ 18]; AITM [ 31]; ESCM2-IPW [ 27];
ESCM2-DR [ 27]; DCMT [ 40]. Besides, we include NSE (naive shared
embedding), which employs a separate network for each task but
shares the embedding table across tasks. We exclude multi-task
methods such as MMOE [ 17] and PLE [ 25] due to their relatively
inferior performance as reported in baselines [27, 31, 40].
4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. In line with the convention [ 6,18,27,
40], we employ the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as the main
evaluation metric for ranking tasks, while adopting the mean square
error (MSE) for regression tasks. All experiments are conducted
five times with different random seeds, and the average value along
with the standard deviation is provided.
4.1.4 Implementations. To ensure a fair comparison, we use the
same backbone network architecture (which we mainly considered
MLP with two or three hidden layers) and the same basic configura-
tions, e.g., embedding size, optimizer, and learning rate, for all tasks
and all methods in our experiments. Besides, we tune the optimum
sample re-weighting ratio for each task for all methods.
Note that owing to the particular nature of our considered multi-
task settings, e.g., CTR and CTCVR are predicting the rates of the
same user w.r.t. the same item, the inputs of different task networks
in our experiments are typically the same and shared.
Due to page limitations, we provide more detailed information
about the datasets and implementations in Appendix B.
4.2 Performance on E-commerce Datasets
We present in Table 4 the experiment results on the e-commerce
datasets in terms of the AUC of the CTCVR estimation task, the
primary goal. As we can see, ResFlow consistently outperforms all
the baselines on all datasets, achieving an average improvement
of1.54%in CTCVR AUC relative to the best-performing baselines.
The results for other tasks, e.g., CTR estimation, are provided in
Appendix B, where ResFlow also gets closely the best performances.
Notably, ESMM achieves the best results on the Shopee datasets
among the baselines, which was the method deployed online prior
to ResFlow. NSE also works reasonably well for CTCVR estimation,
which may have suggested that embedding sharing along with
sample re-weighting can fairly counter the sample sparsity issue.
Although ESCM2tends to have better performance on the AE
datasets, it performs less satisfactorily on the Shopee and AliCPP
datasets. Such instability in performance may be attributed to the
numerical sensitivity of its causal debiasing modules (IPW and DR).
The performance of DCMT is relatively much better and more stable,
which may be attributed to its more advanced debiasing technique.However, it still performs worse than ESMM on the Shopee dataset.
Besides, according to our experiments when applied to three-task
settings, i.e., Shopee-3, the training of all these causal debiasing
methods (ESCM2and DCMT) consistently fails with numerical
errors (NaN), while all other methods work well on Shopee-3 and
lead to considerable improvement compared with Shopee-2.
4.3 Ablation Studies & Parameter Sensitivities
We validate the design of ResFlow by ablation studies. As shown
in Table 5, residual connections for the feature blocks and the final
logit can all lead to significant improvement in performance, while
their combination leads to the largest improvement, which suggests
the effectiveness of residual connections at various levels. It is worth
noticing that when only involving a single residual connection, the
performance gradually increases from "NSE + FR H1-only" (only for
the first feature block) to "NSE + FR H2-only" (only for the second
feature block) to "NSE + LR" (only for logit), which suggests the
residual connection for higher-level abstraction is more critical.
To be more comprehensive, we have also tested adding residual
connections under the ESMM framework. As shown in Table 5,
feature residual can also improve ESMM’s performance, which
echoes the general effectiveness of residual connections in boosting
information transfer. However, further introducing logit residual
aggravates its performance, which should be because logit addition
can not cooperate well with the probability (sigmoid-of-logit) mul-
tiplication (modeling conditional probability). On the other hand,
we can see "NSE + LR" is better than "ESMM" and even "ESMM +
FR", which implies that logit addition, i.e., residual connection for
logit, is a more appropriate choice than probability multiplication.
We study the sensitivity of ResFlow with respect to its key param-
eters. The results on the AE-RU dataset are presented in Figure 3.
We see that ResFlow is not very sensitive to its hyper-parameters.
It is worth noting that the optimal positive weight for the CTR
task is 1, which means it does not require sample re-weighting,
though the positive samples only take around 2.7%, being highly
sparse/imbalanced in a sense. Meanwhile, for the CTCVR task,
where the positive samples take around 0.045%, we need the posi-
tive sample weight to be 500 to gain optimal performance.
4.4 Probing the Residual Learned by ResFlow
To understand how ResFlow transfers information between, for
example, CTR and CTCVR, in different layers, we randomly selected
10 users and sampled 3 items of different interaction types for
each user forming 3 groups, where samples from group A were
clicked with conversion, samples from group B were clicked without
conversion, and samples from group C were not clicked.
Figure 4(a) and 4(b) illustrate the hidden layer feature outputs of
various modules. We can see that the residual learned by the CTCVR
tower (i.e., task network) has a similar value scale as the CTR tower,
resulting in the recovered (after element-wise addition) feature scale
of CTCVR being relatively similar to the CTR tower. By contrast, if
directly learning the CTCVR tower (with NSE), its learned feature
pattern appears to be quite more extreme, primarily being either

Figure 4: Case study of the learned residual. We randomly selected 10 users and sampled 3 items of different types for each user,
forming 3 groups: A (click=1, order=1), B (click=1, order=0), and C (click=0, order=0). The learned residual features and logits of
the CTCVR tower, and other related, are shown. Trained on the AliCCP dataset. ResFlow tends to learn less extreme features
than NSE. The learned residual logits are all negative, and the values in group B are generally smaller than those in group A.
Figure 4(c) shows the learned residual logits by the CTCVR tower.
We see that they are all negative values, and that is exactly how it
should be. Because CTCVR should be strictly less than CTR, i.e.,the logit should be decreased to get a smaller sigmoid probability.
Notably, the learned residual logits of group B are generally smaller

than group A, which is also reasonable since "click without conver-
sion" instances require larger decreases in the logits to shift from a
high probability of clicking to a low probability of conversion.
4.5 More General Multi-Task Scenario
To demonstrate the more general applicability of ResFlow. We ex-
periment with the KuaiRand-Pure-S1 dataset, modeling its user
interactions with videos, including: "valid view", "like", "follow",
"comment", and "forward".
Given that the logical relationships between "follow", "comment",
and "forward" are not that clear, and that there is no significant
differentiation in their frequencies, while they are all clearly less
frequent than "like", and "like" is clearly less frequent than "valid
view". In this experiment, we build residual connections from task
"is_valid_view" to task "is_like", from "is_like" to "is_follow", from
"is_like" to "is_comment", and from "is_like" to "is_forward", respec-
tively, and jointly train the five tasks. Although strict conditional
dependence is lacking, these probability-transfer-based methods
(ESMM, etc.) are also included as baselines.
As shown in Table 6, ResFlow leads to consistent improvement
and achieves the best across all tasks, demonstrating its capability
in modeling such types of progressiveness. Notably, AITM gets an
unsatisfactory performance on the "is_follow" task. We consider
that having too many parameters in its attention-based information
transfer block may have made it more likely to overfit occasionally.
The full table with AUCs of all tasks is provided in Appendix B.
To further validate such an intuitive strategy, i.e., building task
topologies according to their levels of sample sparsity, is a good
choice, we tested a set of other possible task topologies on this
dataset. We visualize them in Figure 5 and provide their respective
results in Table 7. We can see that "topo1", the aforementioned topol-
ogy strategy, performs the best. More specifically, we see that sparse
tasks can generally benefit from denser ones, e.g., task "is_follow",
"is_forward", and "is_comment" in topo1, and task "is_follow" task
in topo2. However, chaining tasks of the same sparsity level or
putting sparse tasks before denser ones may lead to inferior per-
formance, e.g., task "is_forward" and "is_comment" in topo2, task
"is_follow" in topo3, and task "is_forward" and "is_comment" in
topo4. We also notice that task "is_forward" seems to work prop-
erly when chained after task "is_comment" in topo3, which may
be owed to its alignment with users’ overall habits on commenting
and forwarding, but its accuracy is still less than the one in "topo1".Table 6: Performance on KuaiRand-Pure-S1 in terms of AUC.

This all indicates that, for scenarios without explicit dependency
among tasks, building the task topology according to their sample
sparsities can be a sound and easy-to-follow choice.
4.6 Regression as Progressive Multi-Task
Besides predicting the likelihood of user actions, which can be
formulated as classification problems, there are also practical needs
to predict numerical values, e.g., predicting the video playtime or
the rating of a user to an item. In this section, we showcase that such
regression tasks may also be converted as progressive multi-task
learning problems and effectively tackled by ResFlow.
Formally, to predict a value that has a bounded range and in-
dicates progressive engagements as it increases, we discretize the
target variable if it is not inherently discretized. Subsequently, for
each discretized threshold 𝑣𝑘, excluding the minimal one, we define
a task𝑄(𝑣≥𝑣𝑘)to predict the likelihood that the actual value equals
or surpasses 𝑣𝑘. By definition, these tasks embody progressiveness,
necessitating their probabilities non-increase as 𝑣𝑘ascends.1
1Forcing residual logits non-positive, taking min with 0, led to slight gains in this task.

Table 8: Regression performances on KuaiRand-Pure-S1 and
MovieLens-1M in terms of MSE. Progressive indicates con-
verting the regression into a progressive multi-task problem.
Dataset KuaiRand-Pure-S1 MovieLens-1M

Progressive + NSE 1720.12±4.32 0.906±0.002
Progressive + ResFlow 1658.44±5.21 0.894±0.002
For setting the training targets, if the actual value is 𝑣, then by
the definition, all tasks where 𝑣𝑘≤𝑣are assigned with a label of 1,
and all other tasks receive a label of 0. For prediction purposes, we
employ the approximation of the expected value:
E(𝑣)=𝐾−1∑︁
𝑘=0𝑣𝑘·max 𝑄(𝑣≥𝑣𝑘)−𝑄(𝑣≥𝑣𝑘+1),0+𝑣𝐾·𝑄(𝑣≥𝑣𝐾),
where𝑣0<𝑣1<...<𝑣𝐾,𝑣0and𝑣𝐾are the minimal and maximal
possible values respectively, 𝑄(𝑣≥𝑣0)=1, there are 𝐾tasks.
We experiment with: 1) MovieLens-1M, where we predict the
users’ ratings on movies; and 2) KuaiRand-Pure-S1, where we pre-
dict the users’ video playtime. We compare the progressive model-
ing of regression with the traditional regression and test whether
ResFlow can help such progressive modeling. Since multi-task solu-
tions need to involve multiple networks and hence more parameters,
we search for the best network configuration within the multilayer
perception class for all methods for a fair comparison.
As the results presented in Table 8, progressive modeling (with
NSE) works almost equally well as traditional regression, while Res-
Flow can effectively boost the performance of progressive modeling,
leading to clear improvements over traditional regressions.
5 ONLINE DEPLOYMENT
We conducted prolonged A/B tests to assess the effectiveness of
ResFlow in the online environment and ultimately deployed it in the
pre-rank module in the primary search scenario of Shopee. In this
section, we detail our investigations about the online deployment.
5.1 The Pre-Rank Module
The pre-rank module is responsible for sorting roughly filtered item
candidates from the match module and passes the top-ranked to the
rank module. Typically, it needs to handle millions of items within
a very short time, strictly less than 150ms in our scenario, hence
requiring both efficiency and accuracy.
Following the normal practice [ 11,28,38], we adopt a twin-tower
task network architecture for pre-rank: one tower for extracting
representation for user-and-query, and one for item, which is illus-
trated in Figure 7 in the Appendix. It facilitates the separation of
user-query representation inference, which requires online process-
ing, from item representations, which can be precomputed offline.
5.2 Online-Offline Metric Alignment
The main online metric in Shopee is OPU, the average number of
orders placed by each user (in one day). OPU-driven optimization
could contribute to the growth of platform scale and market share.However, online OPU, as well as other similar online metrics,
can only be effectively evaluated online. Regarding offline data, it
is a fixed value that cannot be used to tune the model and hyper-
parameters. Therefore, finding offline metrics that well aligns with
the online metric is vital for efficient model optimization in the
industry, given the time-intensive and costly nature of online A/B
testing. However, commonly used offline metrics do not well align
with the online metrics [ 2,12,38]. Tuning configurations for online
deployments hence has long been and still is a challenge.
To address this, we propose the offline metric Weighted Recall@K
(WR@K), which characterizes how well the model can rank hot
items up within the top K, which we found to align fairly well with
the online metric for pre-rank. Formally,
𝑊𝑅@𝐾=Í𝐾
𝑘=0𝑊𝑘
Í𝑁
𝑛=0𝑊𝑛, (5)
where𝐾is the given parameter of the metric, 𝑁is the total number
of items to be ranked, and 𝑊𝑘indicates the number of orders of
item𝑘(in one day, under a given query).
As results shown in Figure 6 and Table 10, WR@100 aligns rea-
sonably well with OPU compared to other metrics. In the compared
metrics, NDCG is the normalized discounted cumulative gain, while
List AUC is the AUC of the ranked list considering items with order
labels as positive. We consider that the effectiveness of WR@K
stems from its incorporation of collective user feedback (i.e., 𝑊𝑘)
that reflects item popularity, while metrics like List AUC, Recall@K,
and NDCG tend to focus on individual user responses.
Given that List AUC and NDCG emphasize a different perspec-
tive from WR@K and also show a positive correlation with the
online metric to a certain extent, we adopt WR@K as the primary
metric for evaluating model performance, while using List AUC
and NDCG as complementary monitoring metrics [2, 12, 38].
5.3 Score Fusion Strategy
To align with the online metric (OPU in our case) and better provide
the service2, ranking systems in e-commerce platforms typically
fuse multiple scores to form the indicator for item ranking. A his-
torically employed formula for score fusion combines3estimated
CTR and CTCVR multiplicatively [18]:
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =𝐶𝑇𝑅𝛼×𝐶𝑉𝑅𝛽, (6)
which can be equivalently formulated as 𝐶𝑇𝑅𝛼−𝛽×𝐶𝑇𝐶𝑉𝑅𝛽. In our
experiments, we investigated fusing CTR and CTCVR additively:
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =𝛼·𝐶𝑇𝑅+𝛽·𝐶𝑇𝐶𝑉𝑅, (7)
which we found to be more effective. Besides, we tried to further
additively incorporate semantic relevance indicators from other
teams, which also seems valuable.
We search the best weight parameter (e.g., 𝛼and𝛽) for all these
different fusion formulations w.r.t. offline WR@K for ESMM and
ResFlow, and for each of the best, we conduct a two-week online
A/B test. The results are shown in Table 9, where we use ESMM with
CTR1×CVR1, i.e., directly using CTCVR as the ranking indicator,
2It may require exposing more diverse items of interest to users including those they
won’t order. This might be why CTR is typically incorporated in score fusion formulas.
3One could include a price term to balance market scale measured by order quantity
and gross merchandise value. We mainly consider OPU hence omit it for clarity.

as the baseline, and report the relative performances. We see that:
1) ResFlow with CTCVR outperforms ESMM with CTCVR; 2) score
fusions generally lead to better performance than directly using
CTCVR; 3) ResFlow with optimal multiplicative fusion outperforms
that of ESMM; 4) both ESMM and ResFlow show better performance
with additive formulas; 5) ResFlow with optimal additive fusion
outperforms that of ESMM; 6) best-performing formulas4tend to
enhance CTR relative to CVR or CTCVR; 7) adding an optimally
weighted relevance score (RS) leads to a decrease in OPU though im-
proves the bad case rate (the rate of top-ranked items mismatching
user query, from another team); 8) adding an optimally weighted
relevance level (RL, three-level discretized relevance score) degen-
erates OPU slightly, while notably improving the bad case rate.
We consider that multiplicative fusion may be too sensitive to ex-
treme values, e.g., if one score (e.g., CTCVR) is very small, the others
4Note that CTR-0.2×CTCVR is equivalent to CTR0.8×CVR1.0.could lose their voting rights, while additive fusion provides milder
control. Relevance level helps steadily enhance item relevance.
5.4 Online Performance
With the best score fusion formulas for each, we compared 3-target
ResFlow against 3-target ESMM with a two-week online A/B test.
ResFlow achieved a 1.29% uplift in OPU, a 0.88% increase in gross
merchandise value, a 0.84% rise in the number of buyers, a 0.25%
increase in online CTR, and a 1.37% uplift in online CTCVR, com-
pared to ESMM, without an increase in the bad case rate and system
latency, with average and 99th percentile latency being 110 ms and
147 ms respectively for ResFlow v.s. 110 ms and 146 ms for ESMM.
6 CONCLUSION
We have proposed ResFlow, a lightweight multi-task learning frame-
work that enables information transfer via inter-task residual con-
nections, and demonstrated its general effectiveness in various
application scenarios with extensive offline and online experiments.
We have addressed key implementation challenges of deploying
multi-task learning in applied ranking systems, including online-
offline metric alignment and multi-score fusion strategies. ResFlow
is now fully deployed in the pre-rank module of Shopee Search.

A MORE EXPERIMENT RESULTS
A.1 Residual Links in Twin-Tower Architecture
For the twin-tower architecture, illustrated in Figure 7(a), which is
typically employed in the pre-rank module, establishing residual
connections is slightly different from that of the single-tower archi-
tecture. The main concern is where to put the residual links around
the highest-level abstractions, i.e., before or after the inner product.
We have tested different choices. The results are shown in Table 13.
We can see that positioning the residual link before or after the
inner product presents similar performances, while putting it after
the inner product, i.e., building a residual connection on the logits,
leads to slightly better performance. We consider that putting a
residual link after the inner product would treat the inner product
operation along with the last function blocks of the two towers as
the final residual learner, which offers more degrees of freedom
in learning and can leverage a higher degree of abstraction from
the former task, whereas adding residual links before the inner
product is also fine, which defines the last function block of each
tower as a residual learner respectively. In contrast, adding residual
links to both before and after the inner product degenerates the
performance significantly. This should be because the residual link
before the inner product will turn the last function blocks into resid-
ual learners respectively for the two towers, but meanwhile, the
residual link after the inner product also makes the inner product a
residual learner. However, there are no learnable parameters in the
inner product operation, hence it lacks the expressiveness needed
to be a residual learner, which would not ease the learning process
but bring about more burdens to the lower levels. Positioning the
residual link after the dot-product operation is adopted for ResFlow
in Section 4.2 and in online deployment.
A.2 Enforcing Non-Increase of Probability
In sequentially dependent multi-task settings, e.g., "click" "add-
to-cart" "order", when modeling the probabilities of progressing
from the outset to each of the later stages, it is expected that the
predicted probabilities to be non-increasing along the dependency
chain since only when the former action takes place the latter could
possibly happen. According to our experiments, such non-increase
can naturally be learned by the task networks without additional
regularizers in most cases, especially in e-commerce settings where
the ground truth probability for each task shows significant dispari-
ties. Nevertheless, we investigated several regularization techniques
for enforcing such a constraint, including:
(1)Penalizing the increase in probabilities via a regularization de-
fined as, akin to the one used in AITM [31]:
𝐿𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏=∑︁
𝑖𝐾∑︁
𝑘=2max(ˆ𝑦𝑖
𝑘−ˆ𝑦𝑖
𝑘−1,0). (8)
(2) Penalizing residual logits exceeding zero:
𝐿𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡=∑︁
𝑖𝐾∑︁
𝑘=2max(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑖
𝑘,0). (9)
(3)Mandating residual logits to be non-positive, by involving a
min(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡, 0)operator after the logit and before the sigmoid.Table 11: Results of regularizers for enforcing non-increase
of probability. W.O.: ResFlow without non-increase regular-
izer. M1: ResFlow + penalizing increases in probabilities. M2:
ResFlow + penalizing positive residual logits. M3: ResFlow +
mandating non-positive residual logits. M4: ESMM + feature
residual. We tune the best reg weight for each of them.

(4)Generating the output probability via the multiplication of the
output probability of the former task and the probability gener-
ated by a new-build task network, i.e., using the ESMM frame-
work, to ensure the non-increase of probability.
The results are shown in Table 11. We can see that mandating non-
positive residual logits leads to the best results among the four. It
leads to almost the same performance as the non-regularized ver-
sion in most cases, while in some cases brings slight improvement.
Other regularizers, however, may affect the performance.
A.3 WR@K Variants
We have tried different variants of WR@K by replacing the weight
term𝑊𝑘with, for example, log(𝑊𝑘),√︁
𝑊𝑘, and𝑊2
𝑘. The results are
shown in Table 12 and Figure 8. Comparing with Table 10, we can
see that the original version of WR@K aligns with online OPU best.
