ABSTRACT
Graph contrastive learning is a representative self-supervised graph
learning that has demonstrated excellent performance in learning
node representations. Despite the extensive studies on graph con-
trastive learning models, most existing models are tailored to static
graphs, hindering their application to real-world graphs which
are often dynamically evolving. Directly applying these models to
dynamic graphs brings in severe efficiency issues in repetitively
updating the learned embeddings. To address this challenge, we
propose IDOL, a novel contrastive learning framework for dynamic
graph representation learning. IDOL conducts the graph propaga-
tion process based on a specially designed Personalized PageRank
algorithm which can capture the topological changes incrementally.
This effectively eliminates heavy recomputation while maintain-
ing high learning quality. Our another main design is a topology-
monitorable sampling strategy which lays the foundation of graph
contrastive learning. We further show that the design in IDOL
achieves a desired performance guarantee. Our experimental re-
sults on multiple dynamic graphs show that IDOL outperforms the
strongest baselines on node classification tasks in various perfor-
mance metrics.

Graph representation learning has gained significant attention with
the burgeoning of graph data across various applications, such as
social networks [ 24,28], online transactions [ 10,23], recommen-
dation systems [ 21,77] and time-series traffic forecasting [ 16,61].
Given the vast presence of unlabeled graph data, self-supervised
learning on graphs has surged in popularity, which fosters the
success of graph contrastive learning acting as a representative
self-learning methodology [ 25,29,47,48,65]. By maximizing the
similarity among positive samples and dissimilarity among nega-
tive samples, graph contrastive learning has demonstrated excellent
performance in pretraining graph neural networks (GNNs) without
manual labeling, thereby markedly boosting the model performance
in the downstream tasks [39, 52].
Many real-world graphs are intrinsically dynamic, characterized
by the frequent updates of nodes, edges, and attributes [ 76]. For
example, Pinterest [ 74] and Tencent [ 26] use the graph structure to
measure the real-time proximity among users, where each user is a
node and the interaction between users is represented by an edge.
The graph data can be updated thousands of times per second due to
the extensive user base. In such dynamic scenarios, existing research
on graph contrastive learning, originally designed for static graphs,
becomes largely inapplicable [ 44,69,75], because the pretrained
node representations lack the adaptability to accommodate new
topological changes, leading to a decline in effectiveness.
Limitations of Existing Methods. Recent studies [ 3,34,56]
start to explore graph contrastive learning approaches consider-
ing temporal dynamics. They segment the spatial structure of an
evolving graph into multiple snapshots given a time window, which
is called the discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG). Unfortunately,
there are two significant limitations of this category of approaches:
(i) First, these models still lack efficiency, particularly when applied
to large-scale graphs, since the node embeddings have to be regener-
ated via the GNN encoder (e.g., GCN [ 30], TGAT [ 63]) when updates
occur. (ii) Second, the general positive/negative sampling strategy
based on graph augmentation is not tailored to the dynamic graphs
and has been proven insufficient for dynamic graph contrastive
learning [ 13,27,54,67]. For example, one recent method [ 56] as-
sumes that the evolution of a graph unfolds smoothly and thus
directly crafts positive and negative samples from the historical
graphs with short and long timespans. Nonetheless, this sampling
strategy exhibits limited effectiveness because it falls short in ob-
serving the topological changes and has the potential to erroneously
classify stationary nodes as negative samples or evolving nodes as

positive samples, which goes against the intuition of contrastive
objectives.
We contend that the aforementioned issues can be alleviated
by the topology-monitorable capacity, i.e., taking full advantage
of topological changes in dynamic graphs, which is overlooked by
existing contrastive learning studies based on DTDG. Such a design
effectively addresses the limitations mentioned earlier. Firstly, by
continuously monitoring the topological structure, we can iden-
tify evolving nodes and subsequently perform local updates on
their embeddings, eliminating the need for repetitive and global
calculations. Secondly, by quantifying the extent of these changes,
we can use this measure to inform and refine our sampling strate-
gies. Therefore, to endow graph contrastive learning with the
topology-monitorable capacity, we first employ the paradigm of
continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDG) [ 43], which are repre-
sented as a series of temporal edges with continuous dynamics
and can exhibit more evolving locality than DTDG [ 34]. Then, in-
spired by recent GNN simplification works based on Personalized
PageRank (PPR) [ 8,31,36], we propose to measure the topological
changes of dynamic graphs in both graph propagation and pairwise
sampling processes with efficient PPR-based algorithms.
Contributions. Based on this insight, we propose IDOL1, a pi-
oneering approach for node representation learning in continuous-
time dynamic graphs (CTDG). IDOL aims to improve the efficiency
of graph contrastive learning in a dynamic scenario with a paradigm
of incremental update. For this purpose, we suggest to adopt an
efficient graph propagation method based on Personalized PageR-
ank (PPR) [ 9], which enables the incremental embedding update
based on historical embeddings and eliminates repetitive embed-
ding recomputation. In our evaluation, IDOL can achieve up to 3x
faster pretraining compared with baselines. Moreover, we design a
topology-monitorable sampling strategy in self-supervised learning
of dynamic graphs, avoiding repetitive computation for augmen-
tation as well as relaxing the evolving assumption of graphs in
recent literature [ 6,56,64]. From a model design perspective, we
are pioneers in implementing the decoupled architecture (e.g., de-
coupling propagation and training) within the realm of contrastive
learning. Our approach conveys a crucial insight: the effectiveness
in downstream tasks is closely linked to the performance achieved
in our decoupled model design of contrastive learning. This could
potentially spark further innovative investigations within the graph
community. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
•We identify the limitations of existing contrastive learning
methods in the dynamic graph scenario and introduce IDOL as
an innovative self-supervised learning solution, crafted to excel in
continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDG).
•We adopt a PPR-based technique for incremental embedding
update and present a topology-monitorable sampling method to
generate contrastive pairs, thereby significantly boosting training
efficiency and effectively enhancing the embedding quality in con-
trastive learning, respectively.
•To the best of our knowledge, IDOL is a pioneering algorithm
that applies decouple propagation and training in contrastive learn-
ing, and in the meanwhile attaining a desired complexity (see Table
1). Within this innovative framework, we theoretically establish a
1Incremental Dynamic Graph Co trastive Learningperformance guarantee for downstream tasks by linking the con-
trastive loss with the downstream task loss.
•We conduct comprehensive experiments across various real
datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our ap-
proach in dynamic graph scenarios. Remarkably, IDOL outperforms
in prediction accuracy for dynamic node classification, while en-
tailing notably less pretraining time.
2 PRELIMINARY AND RELATED WORKS
In this section, we begin by introducing the problem definition of
this work and review the basic graph contrastive learning frame-
work and Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithms related to our
design. We list the frequently used notations in Appendix A.1. We
leave the detailed proofs of this paper in our technique report [ 12].
2.1 Problem Definition
LetG=(V,E,𝑿)be a directed and attributed graph, where V=
{𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑛}is the set of𝑛nodes,E=V×V is the set of𝑚edges
and𝑿={𝒙1,𝒙2,...,𝒙𝐹}is the set of node attribute matrix with
𝒙𝑖∈R𝑛×1representing the attribute vector in 𝑖-th dimension. For
each node𝑣∈V,N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑣)stands for the out-neighbors of 𝑣and
N𝑖𝑛(𝑣)stands for the in-neighbors.
Then, we define the continuous-time dynamic graph (CTDG).
Consider an initial graph of CTDG G0=(V0,E0), the set of update
events Γupon the graph consists of inserts and deletes of edges2,
represented as Γ={𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒𝑖,...𝑒𝑝}. After the𝑖-th edge update
𝑒𝑖={𝑢𝑖,𝑣𝑖}arrives the system, the current CTDG G𝑖−1is trans-
ferred toG𝑖. If𝑒𝑖already exists inG𝑖−1,𝑒𝑖is treated as a delete from
(𝑢𝑖,𝑣𝑖); otherwise, 𝑒𝑖is treated as an insert. Different with CTDG,
a discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) is represented as a series
of snapshot{G0,G1,...,G𝜏,...,G𝑇}, whereG𝜏signifies the status of
graph at time 𝜏. Since the evolutionary process (e.g., update events)
between two snapshots (e.g., G𝜏1andG𝜏2) is not captured, CTDG
offers a more comprehensive representation than DTDG.
The research problem of this paper, representation learning on
CTDG, is to learn node representation for each node 𝑠at any times-
tamp. Assume there are 𝑝update events based on G𝑖, our target
is to calculate the 𝐹-dimensional node embeddings for the graph
G𝑖+𝑝incrementally. The learned embeddings capture the dynamic
evolution of the CTDG and can be effectively applied to subsequent
graph tasks, such as node classification.
2.2 Graph Contrastive Learning
The representative scheme of Graph Contrastive Learning is Pre-
training and Evaluation, where the node representations are pre-
trained in a self-supervised manner first and then evaluated in
downstream tasks [ 39,71]. The main ingredients of the pretraining
include: (i) Sampling Strategy based on graph augmentation pro-
ducing positive and negative sample pairs, and (ii) Loss Function
supervising the model to determine the similarity of each specific
representation pair [39, 62]. Detailed related works of Graph Con-
trastive Learning are described in Appendix A.2.
In graph-related scenarios, the common sampling strategy gen-
erates two or more augmentation views of the original graph with
2The inserts and deletes of vertices can be replaced by adding and removing relevant
incident edges, hence we only discuss edge updates in this paper.

various augmentation functions such as random node dropping and
feature masking [ 27,67]. According to the connectivity similarity,
one popular mechanism is generally treating the representations
of the same node in two different views as a positive sample pair,
otherwise a negative one [ 56,75]. The loss function of contrastive
learning denotes the negative estimated mutual information, where
the commonly used formats include Jensen–Shannon divergence
[22], NCE [19] and InfoNCE [46].
Specifically, for one node 𝑠in the graph, the positive sample set
{+𝒛𝑠}and negative sample set {−𝒛𝑠}are extracted via the sampling
strategy and we denote the node embedding of node 𝑠as𝒛𝑠3.
Then, in the representation learning model, a GNN encoder 𝑓𝜃(·)
parameterized by 𝜃is utilized to generate node representations,
accompanied by a projector 𝑝(·)(e.g., dot product) measures the
similarity of each representation pair. Finally, the pretraining goal
is to obtain the optimal encoder 𝜃via the contrastive learning loss,
such as the following InfoNCE loss used by [49, 62, 75]:
L𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑁𝐶𝐸 =−1
𝑛𝑛∑︁
𝑠=1log𝑒𝑝(𝒛𝑠,+𝒛𝑠)
𝑒𝑝(𝒛𝑠,+𝒛𝑠)+Í𝑀
𝑖=1𝑒𝑝(𝒛𝑠,−𝒛𝑖), (1)
where𝑝(𝒛1,𝒛2)=𝑓𝜃(𝒛1)𝑓𝜃(𝒛2)⊤/𝜏and𝜏is a temperature hyper-
parameter. The InfoNCE loss estimates the mutual information
between each node representation 𝒛𝑠with one positive sample+𝒛𝑠
and𝑀negative samples{−𝒛𝑖}.
2.3 Personalized PageRank
Given a source node 𝑠and a target node 𝑡in a graph, the Person-
alized PageRank (PPR) [ 9]𝜋(𝑠,𝑡)is a topology-based measure to
reflect the probability that a random walk starting from 𝑠ends
at𝑡. The single-source PPR (SSPPR), which computes 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡)for
any𝑡in a graph given the source node 𝑠, has been a significant
building block of various applications [ 18,37,38,41,42,78]. Given
the source node 𝑠, the SSPPR vector 𝝅(𝑠)∈R1×𝑛aims to obtain
the solution of the following equation:
𝝅(𝑠)=∞∑︁
𝑖=0𝛼(1−𝛼)𝑖·
𝑨𝑫−1𝑖
·𝒆𝑠, (2)
where 𝑨is the adjacent matrix, 𝑫is the degree matrix, 𝛼is the decay
factor of random walk, and 𝒆𝑠is a one-hot vector with 𝒆𝑠(𝑠)=1,
respectively. The SSPPR computation needs to extract eigenvalues
of an𝑛×𝑛matrix and is expensive on a large-scale graph [ 59]. In
3In the later sections, we call that 𝒛𝑠and+𝒛𝑠(resp.−𝒛𝑠) can form a positive (resp.
negative) pair for a clear presentation.order to compute SSPPR efficiently, Forward Push algorithm [ 5] is
developed to approximate the value 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡)given the source node 𝑠
and𝑡∈V, which achieves an underestimate with an error bound.
A detailed description can be found in our technique report [12].
PPR-based Node Embedding. Since PPR can reflect the topo-
logical relationship between nodes, recent studies of simplified
GNNs [ 36] utilize the SSPPR algorithm combined with the attribute
matrix to calculate the embedding of nodes. Such PPR-based node
embedding is more efficient and scalable compared to graph prop-
agation via GNNs, and it facilitates incremental updates through
local modifications to the termination probability of random walks.
Specifically, SCARA [ 36] adopts the Forward Push algorithm to
enhance the scalability of the graph propagation and efficiency.
Instant [ 73] and DynAnom [ 17] utilize a model structure consisting
of PPR-based embedding and refreshing rules to achieve the incre-
mental update for the node embeddings. The hallmark of methods
employing Forward Push is their propagation process, which offers
a fundamental approximation guarantee. Interestingly, our empiri-
cal findings reveal that prioritizing efficiency over this guarantee
can actually enhance accuracy in contrastive learning. Therefore,
we simply aggregate node information from a fixed number of
neighboring hops to not only accelerate embedding computation
but also preserve high-quality results.
3 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Overview
In this section, we introduce our proposed IDOL, which is divided
into three key components as depicted in Figure 1. Firstly, different
from most of the existing contrastive learning methods utilizing
GCN [ 30] or TGAT[ 63] as graph encoder, we decouple the graph
propagation with training, and utilize PPR-based embeddings and
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to incorporate the structural informa-
tion in the initial graph (Sec. 3.2). Secondly, given upcoming update
events, we incrementally update the node embedding efficiently
to avoid the propagation from scratch (Sec. 3.3). Moreover, instead
of generating two different augmented graphs from scratch, we
propose a novel topology-monitorable sampling strategy to avoid
the repetitive computation and directly select positive and negative
samples from the pre-existing historical embeddings (Sec. 3.4). Fi-
nally, we freeze the encoder parameters after pretraining and output
the node embeddings for evaluation in the downstream tasks (e.g.,
node classification). By exploring the connectivity between classi-
fication accuracy and the convergence of our contrastive loss, we
prove that our decoupled and simplified framework IDOL provides

a performance guarantee of the downstream task, demonstrating
the theoretical feasibility and effectiveness (Sec. 3.5).
3.2 PPR-based Embedding by K-hop Push
To achieve scalable node embeddings and update them incremen-
tally in dynamic graphs, we utilize PPR-based algorithms to pre-
calculate node embeddings before processing them through the
MLP layer. The dominant paradigm of existing PPR-based embed-
ding derives from the insight of Forward Push based on a residue
threshold (e.g., [ 36]). Nonetheless, Forward Push, which aims to
approximate PPR scores with an accuracy guarantee, falls short in
effectively showcasing the expressive potential of all nodes during
graph propagation. This limitation can lead to an uneven distri-
bution of smoothness in the node embedding space, ultimately
resulting in a decline in performance [ 45,70]. The experiments in
Sec. 4.5 indicate that this limitation leads to reduced prediction
accuracy compared with our method under the same propagation
time, alongside a heightened sensitivity to hyperparameter settings.
To solve the aforementioned issue, we incorporate the intuition
of APPNP [ 31] aggregating information of K-hop neighbors, and
employ a K-hop Push algorithm to pre-compute the PPR-base node
embeddings. Specifically, we deprecate the approximation paradigm
ofForward Push and adopts the 𝐾-hop truncated terms of Eq. 2 as
follows:
𝒉𝑖=𝐾−1∑︁
𝑙=0𝛼(1−𝛼)𝑙·
𝑨𝑫−1𝑙
·𝒙𝑖. (3)
By employing this design, we ensure that each node can acquire
a balanced smoothness distribution, aligning precisely with a sim-
plified complexity of 𝑂(𝐾𝑚𝐹)as demonstrated in SGC [ 60], given
the hop number 𝐾and feature dimension 𝐹.
Initial Graph Embedding. To calculate the node embeddings in
initial graphG0, we conduct the K-hop Push algorithm to calculate
the PPR values of all nodes for each dimension of the attribute
matrix 𝑿, which is shown in Algorithm 1. Specifically, we extract
the attribute vector (column vector) 𝒙𝑖∈R𝑛×1(1≤𝑖≤𝐹) for each
dimension of 𝑿and assign it as the initial value of residue vector 𝒓0
𝑖.
Meanwhile, the reserve vector 𝒉𝑖∈R𝑛×1is set as the all-zero vector.

of attribute vector 𝒙𝑖, and 𝒉𝑖represents the propagated part. Then,
we iteratively repeat the following steps for 𝑙={0,1,...,𝐾−1}.
For each node 𝑠∈V,(1−𝛼)fraction of 𝒓𝑙
𝑖(𝑠)will be propagated
into the out-neighbors 𝑡∈N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑠), and hence each out-neighbor
𝑡iteratively receives (1−𝛼)·𝒓𝑙
𝑖(𝑠)/|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑠)|and add it to the
residue 𝒓𝑙+1
𝑖(𝑡). Additionally, 𝛼fraction of 𝒓𝑙
𝑖(𝑠)will be transferred
into the reserve vector 𝒉𝑖(𝑠)and𝒓𝑙
𝑖(𝑠)is reset as 0. At the end of
𝑙-th iteration, we clear the residue vector 𝒓𝑙
𝑖to save the space.
After we conduct the propagation and obtain the K-hop reserve
vector 𝒉𝑖(1≤𝑖≤𝐹) via K-hop Push for all dimensions in 𝑿, the
final node embedding matrix can be concatenated as:
𝒁=Concat(𝒉1,𝒉2,...,𝒉𝐹), (4)
where each node embedding 𝒛𝑠∈R1×𝐹. Compared with existing
contrastive learning methods utilizing GCN [ 30] or TGAT [ 63] for
graph propagation, the above PPR-based embedding process is more
efficient and scalable. We will further discuss the computational
complexity in the Sec. 3.6.
3.3 Incremental Embedding Update
In our decoupled contrastive learning approach, we initially pre-
calculate node embeddings for the initial graph using the previously
described steps. However, the graphs incur frequent updates upon
the nodes and edges in the dynamic scenarios, which requires
us to incorporate the updated information and reform the node
embedding. Instead of recalculating embedding from scratch or
requiring repetitive convolution operations such as the works in
[6,56], we focus on transforming partial embeddings incremen-
tally triggered by the update events. Due to the characteristics of
the PPR algorithm, one can locally adjust the reserve vector 𝒉𝑖
and residue vector 𝒓𝑖for value updates provided that the invariant
property between them is maintained [ 17,73]. Following the up-
dating streamline of the vanilla PPR methods employed in Instant
[73] and DynAnom [ 17], we adopt a similar approach to refresh
the embeddings while holding the invariant property. For com-
pleteness, we refer interested readers to our technical report [ 12]
for a complete proof and references. Given the invariant property
𝒉𝑖(𝑢)+𝛼𝒓𝑖(𝑢)=𝛼𝒙𝑖(𝑢)+Í
𝑣∈N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)(1−𝛼)𝒉𝑖(𝑣)
|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑣)|(𝑢∈ V ), we
summarize the heart of updating rules in the following lemma:
4703Topology-monitorable Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
Lemma 1. When adding an edge (𝑢,𝑣), performing the follow-
ing rules can maintain this invariant property: 𝒓𝑖(𝑢)← 𝒓𝑖(𝑢)−
𝒉𝑖(𝑢)
𝛼|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)|,𝒓𝑖(𝑣)←𝒓𝑖(𝑣)+(1−𝛼)𝒉𝑖(𝑢)
𝛼|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)|,𝒉𝑖(𝑢)←𝒉𝑖(𝑢)·|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)|+1
|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)|.
Compatibility with DTDG. By adhering to these principles,
edges are incorporated into the CTDG based on their chronolog-
ical sequence. DTDG, a specific instance of CTDG, can also be
managed using the update rules by leveraging the timestamps of
edges across various snapshots. Given that the degree of node
𝑢at time𝜏isN𝜏
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)and the degree change from 𝜏1to𝜏2is
Δ𝜏1,𝜏2(𝑢)=N𝜏2
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)−N𝜏1
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢), we can update the reserve and
residue vector from snapshot G𝜏1toG𝜏2utilizing the following
derivative rules: 𝒓𝑖(𝑢)← 𝒓𝑖(𝑢)−Δ𝜏1,𝜏2(𝑢))𝒉𝑖(𝑢)
𝛼|N𝜏1
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑢)|,𝒓𝑖(𝑣)← 𝒓𝑖(𝑣)+
(1−𝛼)Δ𝜏1,𝜏2(𝑢)𝒉𝑖(𝑢)
𝛼|N𝜏1
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)|,𝒉𝑖(𝑢)←𝒉𝑖(𝑢)·|N𝜏2
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)|
|N𝜏1
𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)|.
With the rules above, we incrementally update the vectors of
nodes affected by the update event, accompanied by updating their
node embeddings. We provide the pseudo-code of updating the node
embeddings in our technique report [ 12]. With such embedding
update approach, we next discuss how to generate contrastive pairs
for the updated embeddings using a topology-based approach as
detailed in Section 3.4.
3.4 Topology-monitorable Sampling
The concepts of graph augmentation are central to the paradigm of
contrastive learning. Recent works [ 56] emphasize the assumption
that the evolution of graphs unfolds smoothly, and the overall
properties remain relatively stable despite occasional edge updates.
However, this constraint is impractical and too strong in real-world
applications, as a node might undergo substantial updates in a short
interval while remaining unchanged over an extended one. We
experimentally prove that employing this assumption is suboptimal
to capture the practical dynamics in Sec. 4.5.
In order to break this strong constraint, we propose a topology-
monitorable sampling strategy to generate positive and negative
samples from the topological views in the dynamic graph. Formally,
given a snapshotG𝑖+𝑝to be predicted, we explicitly exploit the
topological transformation caused by 𝑝update events and adopt a
PPR-based approach to distinguish the positive and negative pairs
from the historical embeddings of G𝑖.
Topological measurement by PPR. As a measurement of
topological information, the difference in SSPPR values between
two snapshotsG𝑖andG𝑖+𝑝reflect the topological change on a
node caused by 𝑝updates. Since SSPPR contains 𝜋(𝑠,𝑡)for any
𝑡in a graph given the source node 𝑠, we utilize the maximum
value of𝜋 G𝑖+𝑝,𝑠,𝑡−𝜋(G𝑖,𝑠,𝑡)to describe the impact degree
of the node𝑠caused by𝑝updates. Then we define an impact vector
𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝∈R𝑛×1representing the impact degrees on all graph nodes,
where each element of 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝is defined as:
𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)=max
𝑡∈V𝑖𝜋 G𝑖+𝑝,𝑠,𝑡−𝜋(G𝑖,𝑠,𝑡),𝑠∈V𝑖.(5)
Upper bound of impact vector. As the graph evolves, the
measurement 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)can capture the upper bound of topolog-
ical change on node 𝑠and guide us to distinguish positive and
negative samples. However, the exact result of 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝requires a
time-consuming computation with respect to all-pair PPR values,Algorithm 2: Dynamic Sampling Algorithm

which refers to the calculation of 𝜋 G𝑖+𝑝,𝑠,𝑡and𝜋(G𝑖,𝑠,𝑡)for
all𝑠,𝑡∈V𝑖. Instead of the redundant calculation, we estimate the
upper bound of 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)in the following lemma:
Lemma 2. Given the update sequence Γ={(𝑢1,𝑣1),(𝑢2,𝑣2),...,
(𝑢𝑝,𝑣𝑝)}, we have:
𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)≤𝑝∑︁

𝛼|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(G𝑖+𝑝,𝑢𝑗)|.
Based on Lemma 2, the impact on any 𝑠∈V𝑖caused by the
update sequence Γis related to the PPR value 𝜋 G𝑖,𝑠,𝑢𝑗and the
degree|N𝑜𝑢𝑡 G𝑖,𝑢𝑗|and|N𝑜𝑢𝑡 G𝑖+𝑝,𝑢𝑗|, where𝑢𝑗is the start-
ing node of the updated edge in Γ. The calculation of 𝜋 G𝑖,𝑠,𝑢𝑗for
all𝑠∈G𝑖can be implemented by Reverse Push algorithm focusing
on single-target PPR [ 4]. Nonetheless, the Reverse Push method can
only assist in estimating a single update, making it inefficient when
dealing with batch updates (e.g., update sequence Γ).
Considering the batch update events included in Γ, we incorpo-
rate the insight of Reverse Push to efficiently estimate the upper
bound of 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)after𝑝update events for each 𝑠∈V𝑖, which is
shown in Algorithm 2 (lines 3-8). Similar to K-hop Push, we maintain
an auxiliary residue vector 𝒓𝑏. We assign the intial value of 𝒓𝑏at𝑢𝑗as
||N𝑜𝑢𝑡(G𝑖+𝑝,𝑢𝑗)|−|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(G𝑖,𝑢𝑗)||
|N𝑜𝑢𝑡(G𝑖+𝑝,𝑢1)|, where𝑢𝑗is the starting point of the
update event in Γ(line 4), and otherwise set it as 0. The difference is
that we set a residue threshold 𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥 to early stop the iteration pro-
cess (line 5) and the residue value (e.g., 𝒓𝑏(𝑠)) is propagated along
the in-neighbor set N𝑖𝑛(G𝑖,𝑠)(line 6). Notice that for Dynamic Sam-
pling we replace the manner utilized in K-hop Push since setting the
threshold𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥 can provide us with an intermediate upper bound of
𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)demonstrated as: 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)≤𝝅𝑏(𝑠)+𝑟𝑏
𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝛼. To simplify
our presentation, we directly introduce this crucial intermediate
upper bound here. It plays a pivotal role in sampling contrastive

pairs, as elaborated in the upcoming Lemma 3. The detailed proof
of this upper bound can be found in the technique report [12].
Sampling with impact vector. After the iteration in Reverse
Push ends, we compared the value of𝑟𝑏
𝑚𝑎𝑥+𝝅𝑏(𝑠)
𝛼with an empirical
gap threshold 𝜆to filter the positive samples from G𝑖satisfying
𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)≤𝜆, as presented in the following lemma:
Lemma 3. Given the update event sequence Γ={(𝑢1,𝑣1),(𝑢2,𝑣2),
...,(𝑢𝑝,𝑣𝑝)}, the result returned by Algorithm 2 guarantees that for
any node index 𝑠in{+𝒛𝑠}, we have 𝑰G𝑖,G𝑖+𝑝(𝑠)≤𝜆.
Based on Lemma 3, the nodes experiencing minor impacts, as de-
termined by 𝜆, are selected. Then we treat the corresponding histor-
ical embeddings in G𝑖as the positive sample set {+𝒛𝑠}. Meanwhile,
we retain other nodes that incur significant topological changes and
treat their historical embeddings as negative samples (line 10-14).
Here we also denote the positive and negative samples of G𝑖+𝑝as
+𝒁G𝑖+𝑝={+𝒛𝑠}and−𝒁G𝑖+𝑝={−𝒛𝑠}respectively. The concrete
value of𝑛𝑝=|+𝒁G𝑖+𝑝|and𝑛𝑔=|−𝒁G𝑖+𝑝|can be coordinated by
setting different threshold 𝜆and we can easily get 𝑛𝑝+𝑛𝑔=𝑛,
where𝑛is the number of nodes.
3.5 Theoretical Performance Guarantee
After pre-calculating the node embeddings and building contrastive
pairs, we form our contrastive loss within a decoupled architec-
ture. Generally, the contrastive loss enforces the embeddings to
be discriminative between the positive pairs from the joint dis-
tribution𝑝(𝒛𝑠,+𝒛𝑠)and the negative pairs from the marginal dis-
tribution𝑝(𝒛𝑠)and𝑝(−𝒛𝑠). Given the positive sample set+𝒁G𝑖+𝑝
and negative sample set−𝒁G𝑖+𝑝, the node representations after
our MLP encoder is denoted as 𝑓𝜃(𝒛𝑠),𝑓𝜃(+𝒛𝑠)and𝑓𝜃(−𝒛𝑠). Here
𝑓𝜃(𝒛𝑠)=𝒛𝑠·𝒘𝜃∈R1×𝐹′, where 𝒘𝜃∈R𝐹×𝐹′is the shared trainable
parameters and 𝐹′is the hidden dimension of the representation.
Then we build the contrastive objective of IDOL as follows:
L𝐼𝐷𝑂𝐿 =1
𝑛©­
«𝑛𝑔∑︁
𝑠=1𝑓𝜃(𝒛𝑠)𝑓𝜃(−𝒛𝑠)⊤−𝑛∑︁
𝑠=𝑛𝑔+1𝑓𝜃(𝒛𝑠)𝑓𝜃(+𝒛𝑠)⊤ª®
¬,(6)
where we denote the index of nodes which have the negative sam-
ples as{1,2,...𝑛𝑔}, and the index with respect to positive samples
as{𝑛𝑔+1,𝑛𝑔+2,...𝑛𝑔+𝑛𝑝}. The overall number of positive and
negative samples is identical to 𝑛, which is significantly smaller
than that of previous loss functions such as InfoNCE in Eq. 1. Note
that since there is no historical embedding to augment the initial
graphG0, we follow the work in [ 58,72] and shuffle the node order
in𝑿to generate negative samples, where we have 𝑛𝑝=0,𝑛𝑔=𝑛.
We further provide a theoretical perspective to prove the capa-
bility of topology-monitorable graph contrastive learning in down-
stream tasks. Considering the classical node classification task, we
use𝒀={𝑦1,𝑦2,...,𝑦𝑛}to denote the label set and we adopt the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss [11] as:
L𝐶𝐸=−1
𝑛𝑛∑︁
𝑠=1logexp
𝑓𝜃(𝒛𝑠)𝑤⊤𝑦𝑠
Í𝐶
𝑖=1exp
𝑓𝜃(𝒛𝑠)𝑤⊤
𝑖 (7)
where𝑤𝑖is the trainable weights for 𝑖-th class in the linear classifier
utilized in downstream tasks and the weight matrix is denoted as
𝑾𝐶={𝑤1,𝑤2,...,𝑤𝐶}given there are 𝐶classes.The performance in the downstream tasks and the contrastive
pretraining are demonstrated by the downstream task loss L𝐶𝐸
and the contrastive loss L𝐼𝐷𝑂𝐿 respectively. Then, we have the
following upper bound of the downstream task loss L𝐶𝐸:
Lemma 4. The lossL𝐶𝐸can be bounded by the loss L𝐼𝐷𝑂𝐿 :
L𝐶𝐸≤L𝐼𝐷𝑂𝐿+log𝐶+2
3𝑎2(8)
holds with probability at least 1−𝑂(1/𝑛). Here we assume 𝑿∈
[−1,1]after the feature normalization, and our graph encoder 𝑓𝜃(·)
is Xavier [ 14] initialized using a uniform distribution 𝒘𝜃∼𝑈(−𝑎,𝑎).
Regarding IDOL’s decoupled architecture during graph propa-
gation and pretraining, Lemma 4 hints a crucial point: the extent
of pretraining considerably impacts the performance of the down-
stream tasks. Given that the value of (log𝐶+2
3𝑎2)is relatively
minor compared to the loss value, reducing L𝐼𝐷𝑂𝐿 can effectively
enhance downstream task performance. This observation supports
the fact that even a single epoch of pretraining with IDOL can yield
high accuracy in downstream tasks. Additionally, the improved
convergence of the contrastive loss further boosts the classification
accuracy. This observation is validated in our hyperparameter anal-
ysis, as shown in Sec. 4.6 where we varied the number of training
epochs in the encoder. Moreover, while this direct association be-
tween pretraining and downstream task performance is specific to
IDOL, it could also shed light on the rationale behind the need for
sufficient pretraining epochs in existing graph contrastive learning
methods [44, 55, 58] in improving downstream task performance.
3.6 Complexity Analysis
Compared with the contrastive methods using GCN-based encoder
such as [ 55,58,72,75], IDOL takes less time to pretrain in the dy-
namic scenarios. Taking a 𝐾-layer [ 30] GCN encoder as an example,
these methods need to take 𝑂(4𝐾𝑛𝐹2+4𝐾𝑚𝐹)time4per training
step including forward propagation and backward propagation
of the network. On the initial graph, IDOL directly computes the
node embeddings by our K-hop algorithm, which only consumes
𝑂(2𝐾𝑚𝐹)time (𝑂(𝐾𝑚𝐹)for negative sampling). In addition to the
MLP encoder (optional as one layer), the complexity of IDOL on
the initial graph per training step is 𝑂(4𝑛𝐹2+2𝐾𝑚𝐹).
When incurring the update events, the GCN-encoder needs to
conduct the graph propagation and network training from scratch,
In contrast, the embedding update only consumes 𝑂(𝐾𝑚𝐹)time5,
since we reuse the historical embeddings as our positive and nega-
tive samples. For the complexity of distinguishing positive and neg-
ative samples, the Reverse Push consume𝑂(𝑝/𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥)time given𝑝
update events [ 4]. Since we set an empirical value as 𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥=1/log𝑛,
the complexity for updating 𝑝edges is𝑂(4𝑛𝐹2+𝐾𝑚𝐹+𝑝log𝑛).
The summary of the above analysis can be viewed in Table 1.
4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate IDOL to show its effectiveness and effi-
ciency for contrastive learning in dynamic graphs. We conducted
4Here we assume for simplicity that the hidden size is 𝐹. This complexity includes
𝑂(2𝐾𝑛𝐹2+2𝐾𝑚𝐹)for positive encoder and 𝑂(2𝐾𝑛𝐹2+2𝐾𝑚𝐹)for negative
encoder.
5In practice, the complexity of incremental update given 𝑝update events is much
smaller than𝑂(𝐾𝑚𝐹)when𝑝is not large.

tion of our model IDOL at https://github.com/ZulunZhu/dynamic-
contrastive-learning.git. More interesting experiments and analysis
can be found in our technique report [12].
4.1 Datasets
We conduct our experiments on four commonly used datasets: Arxiv,
Mag, Products [23], and Patent [20]. These datasets are chosen to
demonstrate the effectiveness of IDOL in various graph application
scenarios, such as citation networks, web graphs, and recommenda-
tion systems. The statistics of four datasets are introduced in Table
2. For Arxiv, Mag, Products, the partition of training, validation, and
testing set follows a chronological split in OGB [ 23]. For the dy-
namic dataset Patent, the training size is arranged as 70%including
10%for validation. All results shown are the averages from 10 runs.
4.2 Baseline Methods
We compare IDOL with the following graph contrastive learning
baselines: DGI[ 58],BGRL [ 55], GGD[ 72] and SUGRL [ 44]. We also
compare IDOL with CLDG[ 64], a state-of-the-art contrastive learn-
ing method focusing on dynamic graphs. Furthermore, two classical
GNN methods are included, GCN [ 30] and SGC [ 60], along with
two scalable GNN methods, SCARA [ 36] and Instant [ 73]. To ensure
reproducibility, we provide a detailed experiment setting in Appen-
dix A.3. Specifically, for Topology-monitorable Sampling, we set the
threshold𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥=1/log𝑛and𝜆=1/𝑛by default in IDOL, where
𝑛is the node number of datasets. Then, for our two PPR-based
algorithms, we set the teleport probability 𝛼=0.1onArxiv, Mag
Products, and 𝛼=0.2onPatent.
4.3 Comparison within CTDG settings
In our experiments, we employ the node classification task in dy-
namic graphs to evaluate the embedding quality of our method. In
order to simulate the dynamic scenarios, we follow the experiment
setting of CTDG in [ 73] to segment the whole graph and transform
it into evolving states on these datasets. Formally, we divide the
whole graph into an initial graph and 𝑆partitions of edge sequences
for demonstration, where the edge sequences are extracted evenly
from the complete graph. During the evaluation process, we pro-
gressively update the initial graph with 𝑆partitions of removed
edges following the format of CTDG and evaluate all models after
each addition of these partitions. Notably, the additions of removed
edges are ordered according to the true timestamps.
Dynamic accuracy comparison. We first compare the accuracy
performance of IDOL with the competitive baselines. For a clear

demonstration, we evaluate the Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 scores and
report the average values over all moments of evaluation, which
is summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that IDOL outperforms
previous contrastive learning methods (e.g., DGI, BGRL, SUGRL,
GGD, and CLDG) with a non-trivial gap. Compared with the worst
model DGI and the best CLDG, our method on average improves by
7.33%and4.07%onProducts dataset, respectively. We also note that
IDOL surpasses traditional supervised GNN methods such as GCN,
SGC, SCARA, and Instant, all of which are trained through an end-
to-end supervised process without incorporating the contrastive
learning mechanism. This finding reinforces the notion that the
integration of the contrastive learning paradigm can significantly
enhance the quality of embeddings.
Moreover, we present the detailed performance of multiple con-
trastive learning methods when adding each edge sequence, which
is shown in Figure 2. We adopt the Micro-F1 scores to measure this
comparison and we have the following key observation: The predic-
tion performance of IDOL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets. It is worth noting that, IDOL achieves compa-
rable or even better results on each snapshot of all datasets, where
IDOL even outperforms the advanced methods DGI and GGD by
over 16.5%on the initial graph of Products datasets. Notice that
forProducts andPatent datasets, IDOL substantially outperforms
the baselines by a large margin, including the competitive method
CLDG. The notable performance advantage of IDOL can be credited
to its use of an efficient full-graph processing approach for training,
in contrast to other methods that require batch processing and
neighbor sampling in large graphs. This approach, which fully inte-
grates topology information, significantly enhances performance.
Dynamic efficiency comparison. To demonstrate the effi-
ciency of IDOL, we investigate the time consumption of each con-
trastive learning method on each dataset. Table 4 reports the av-
erage pretraining time (per epoch) over all snapshots. Similarly,
we also provide the detailed results on all datasets for each evalua-
tion in Figure 3. For the initial graph, we observe that IDOL shares
a close time consumption as baseline methods, which includes
the time of embedding calculation and network training. Never-
theless, in the later addition of edge sequences, IDOL drastically

achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration, and the gap between
IDOL and baseline methods becomes even more pronounced as
the graph scale increases. Especially, in the full graph of Products,
GGD and DGI require over 120 seconds each epoch for pretrain-
ing, while IDOL completes this process in just 16.2 seconds. Even
faced with suboptimal baseline CLDG, IDOL can still achieve up

achieve high prediction accuracy reported in Figure 2 with only one

performance, showing a substantial disparity in training efficiency.Table 5: The average prediction accuracy (%) on Mooc and

The remarkable performance of IDOL can be attributed to two
primary factors. First, IDOL efficiently saves pretraining time by
incorporating edge updates and implementing incremental embed-
ding refreshment. Additionally, its straightforward MLP structure
simplifies the networks and further enhances training efficiency.
Secondly, our topology-monitorable sampling method, designed to
capture topological changes from an evolving perspective, directly
contributes to potential improvements in the quality of positive
and negative pairs. Collectively, these two factors underpin IDOL’s
exceptional efficiency and effectiveness, respectively.
4.4 Comparison within DTDG Settings
In the above experiments, we adopt the CTDG setting to evaluate
the performance of IDOL on large-scale datasets. It’s worth noting,
though, that some DTDG-based algorithms, which don’t scale well
in these large-scale datasets, can still perform competitively on
smaller datasets by leveraging the fine-grained time information.
To further establish IDOL’s versatility, we conducted a compara-
tive analysis of IDOL against a selection of prominent algorithms
on two smaller datasets, Mooc [ 1] and Reddit [ 2]. In this experi-
ment, we follow the DTDG setting outlined in existing literature
[32,50,56], which focuses on predictions for the fully-formed final
graph. The results of node classification andlink prediction tasks are
summarized in Table 5. Based on this result, IDOL demonstrates
broad applicability across various graph types and downstream
tasks, achieving comparable prediction accuracy while necessitat-
ing shorter pretraining durations. This underscores IDOL’s capacity
for generalization and efficiency in diverse graph environments.

4.5 Ablation Studies
In this section, we conduct ablation studies on the variants of IDOL
to verify the effectiveness of two key modules comprehensively:
K-hop Push andTopology-monitorable Sampling.
K-hop Push. OnPatent datasets, we replace K-hop Push module
with the conventional Forward Push algorithm [ 8,73] which utilizes
an empirical threshold 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 to early stop the iteration of graph
propagation. Moreover, we also replace K-hop Push with the propa-
gation method in SGC [ 60] for a comparison. As shown in Table 6,
Forward Push andK-hop Push require more propagation time with
a smaller𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 and a larger 𝐾, respectively. Nevertheless, K-hop
Push consistently achieves higher accuracy within a comparable
time frame. Furthermore, the notable variability in performance
with Forward Push implies the need for careful selection of the 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥
threshold, while K-hop Push proves to be more stable across various
settings of hop number 𝐾.
Topology-monitorable Sampling. We compare our sampling
strategy with the time-based strategy in [ 56], which adopts different
time windows to sample the positive and negative pairs. To generate
different variants, we replace the positive or negative samples in
Topology-monitorable Sampling by directly sampling from all nodes
in the previous 𝜏+-th or𝜏−-th snapshot, respectively. Additionally,
we also provide a sampling strategy named random corruption for
comparison, which disturbs the graph topology for augmentation
and is widely used in previous works [ 55,58,72]. As indicated
in Table 7, we evaluate different sampling strategies on the final
snapshot of three datasets. It is evident that, compared with our
method, the utilization of time-based strategies consistently results
in a decline in prediction accuracy. Additionally, this decline in
accuracy is tied to the incorrect categorization of negative and
positive samples. For example, on the Arxiv dataset, accuracy falls
from 70.49%to69.94%when𝜏+changes from 1 to 5. This is because,
over a longer time window, the graph’s structure changes more
significantly, causing more samples to be mistakenly identified
as positive. This supports the importance of sampling positive
and negative pairs based on topological information, as it proves
beneficial for enhancing correct sampling.

4.6 Hyperparameter Analysis
We further analyze the hyperparameter sensitivity of IDOL. The
experimental results on Arxiv dataset are reported and we have
similar observations on the other datasets.
Threshold 𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥and𝜆inDynamic Sampling. To achieve
topology-monitorable sampling, we employ 𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥 as the early-stopping
threshold in the Reverse Push algorithm and further utilize an
empirical gap value 𝜆to distinguish the positive samples from
historical embeddings. As shown in Figure 4(a), we present the
average accuracy on Arxiv by varying the values of 𝑟𝑏𝑚𝑎𝑥 and𝜆as
{0.5/log𝑛,1/log𝑛,2/log𝑛,5/log𝑛,10/log𝑛}and{0.5/𝑛,1/𝑛,2/𝑛,
5/𝑛,10/𝑛}, respectively. It is observed that various settings typically
do not significantly affect IDOL, as IDOL consistently delivers its
best performance using our default configuration.
Hidden size and pretraining epoch. We investigate the IDOL
variants with different hidden sizes and pretraining epochs, as illus-
trated in Figure 4(b). For a fair comparison, we start this study based
on the default setting of the hidden size and epoch number (e.g., 1024
and 1) in the aforementioned experiments. When the hidden size
exceeds 512, the results tend to converge closely. However, reducing
the hidden size to 128 leads to a notable decline in classification
performance. The reason might be that low-dimensional hidden
vectors cannot effectively represent large-scale graph information.
Furthermore, we can naturally produce a better performance by
utilizing more epochs. Since a longer pretraining period will further
decreaseL𝐼𝐷𝑂𝐿 , which enhances the prediction accuracy of the
downstream task.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose IDOL, a first-ever topology-monitorable
contrastive learning framework focusing on dynamic graphs. Given
the graph updates, IDOL employs PPR-based techniques to incre-
mentally update node embeddings and uses a strategy that monitors
topology changes to select positive and negative pairs. Besides, we
employ a simplified training paradigm and provide a performance
guarantee by bridging the contrastive loss and the downstream
task loss. In terms of time efficiency and prediction accuracy, we
conduct extensive experiments on various graph datasets and verify
that IDOL is superior to state-of-the-art methods.

A.2 More Related Work
A.2.1 Dynamic Graph Representation Learning. There exist two
major types of approaches, including the methods focusing on
DTDG and CTDG.
Discrete-Time Dynamic Graph. Representation learning over
dynamic graphs primarily focused on discrete-time dynamic graphs
(DTDGs), which are represented by a series of graph snapshots cap-
tured at discrete time points. Literature on DTDGs has been exten-
sively studied due to ease of implementation. Many architectures
for DTDGs are based on combining static GNNs with sequence
models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which can be
applied recurrently to the network parameters [ 47], hierarchical
node states [ 66], or to a set of embeddings encoded from each graph
snapshot [ 35]. Another line of research involves performing tem-
poral random walks on graph snapshots to obtain dynamic node
representations [53, 68].
Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph. Although DTDG meth-
ods have proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional
node representations for dynamic graphs, one limitation is their
difficulty in capturing fine-grained temporal dynamics and contin-
uous changes in the evolving structure. Recently, continuous-time
dynamic graphs (CTDGs) have been widely studied, which consider
graphs where the temporal evolution is modeled as a continuousprocess. Early works employ self-attention mechanisms to learn a
dynamic node representation by attending over its neighbors and
historical representations [ 56,63]. Sequence models are also promis-
ing methods for CTDGs. For example, JODIE [ 33] and TGN [ 51] use
RNNs to propagate messages across interactions to update node rep-
resentations. In addition, temporal point processes (TPP) are applied
for modeling continuous-time event sequences [ 40,57,79]. Unlike
prior methods that recompute node embeddings from scratch for
each prediction in dynamic scenarios, our approach utilizes incre-
mental computation, optimizing both computation efficiency and
memory usage.
A.2.2 Graph Contrastive Learning. Graph contrastive learning lever-
ages the concept of positive and negative samples combined with a
discrimination rule to learn the representation of nodes, capturing
statistical dependencies and enhancing the meaningful patterns
from graphs. DGI [ 58] is the first approach to maximize the mutual
information between the node embeddings and graph embeddings,
which enables the graph encoder to learn both local and global
information. BYOL [ 15] and BGRL[ 55] attempt to get rid of the
high overhead for sampling negative pairs and achieve promising
performance when only utilizing positive pairs. GGD[ 72] simplifies
the loss computation of DGI and conducts the pretraining only with
a few epochs. Lastly, DDGCL[ 56] aims to capture the dynamics in
the graphs and accommodate the temporal information during the
process of positive sampling.
Due to such label scarcity, graph contrastive learning can also
be used to improve the model quality by enhancing the consis-
tency of different augmentation views. GRAND [ 13] generates dif-
ferent augmentation views of the graph by dropping nodes and
masking features, and then the mutual information of the scarce
labeled nodes based on different views is minimized to enhance the
prediction performance. NASA [ 7] randomly replaces the 1-hop
neighbors with 2-hop neighbors for the labels nodes and use a
neighbor-constrained regularization to improve the consistency of
adjacent nodes.

A.3 Experiment Settings and Extral results
We summarize the experimental setting of all baseline in Table 9.
To provide enough comparison with the baselines, we employ the
batched processing with neighbour sampling on GCN, SGC, DGI
and GGD when processing on Mag, Products andPatent datasets.
We keep the same setting with the common parameters like learn-
ing rate, K, hidden size. Following the work in [ 72], we set the
pretraining epoch of IDOL and GGD as 1, and the epoch number
of others is set as 200.
