ABSTRACT
Social Recommendation (SR) typically exploits neighborhood influ-
ence in the social network to enhance user preference modeling.
However, users’ intricate social behaviors may introduce noisy
social connections for user modeling and harm the models’ robust-
ness. Existing solutions to alleviate social noise either filter out
the noisy connections or generate new potential social connec-
tions. Due to the absence of labels, the former approaches may
retain uncertain connections for user preference modeling while
the latter methods may introduce additional social noise. Through
data analysis, we discover that (1) social noise likely comes from
the connected users with low preference similarity; and (2) Opin-
ion Leaders (OLs) play a pivotal role in influence dissemination,
surpassing high-similarity neighbors, regardless of their prefer-
ence similarity with trusting peers. Guided by these observations,
we propose a novel Self-Supervised Denoising approach through
Independent Cascade Graph Augmentation, for more robust SR.
Specifically, we employ the independent cascade diffusion model
to generate an augmented graph view, which traverses the social
graph and activates the edges in sequence to simulate the cascading
influence spread. To steer the augmentation towards a denoised
social graph, we (1) introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to
prioritize the activation of OLs first, followed by high-similarity
neighbors, while weakening the low-similarity neighbors; and (2)
integrate an information bottleneck based contrastive loss, aiming
to minimize mutual information between original and augmented

1 INTRODUCTION
Social Recommendation (SR) predicts the user’s preference by lever-
aging both the user-item interaction network and the social net-
work. The underlying principle of SR is known as the homophily
theory [ 20], that is, individuals are more inclined to be influenced
by those people they know or trust. However, there may exist noisy
connections in social networks due to the intricate nature of users’
social behavior and the low cost of making connections. For in-
stance, users may establish connections with others for diverse
reasons or even connect to others by accident. As shown in Fig-
ure 1, the preference similarity between many connected users
in the social network is very low, with a majority of them lower
than 0.4. Hence, these connections are likely noise and should be
cautiously utilized for user preference modeling.
However, most SR approaches [ 4,29,44,50,52], which are mainly
built upon the powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture
the interconnections among nodes, indiscriminately employ all
social connections including the noisy ones. This inevitably leads to

sub-optimal user preference inference, consequently undermining
the model’s robustness. Although there are approaches designed
to eliminate social noise for robust SR, they typically either filter
out noisy social connections [ 24,40,41] or generate new potential
connections [ 49–51], while unobserved, are likely to exert social
influence. Due to the absence of ground truth labels, both methods
exploit supervision signals from the original noisy social networks.
As a result, the relevance of the preserved connections to user
preference modeling remains uncertain, and the inclusion of new
connections may introduce further noise.
Recently, Self Supervised Learning (SSL) [ 3], a paradigm that
learns from unlabeled data, has achieved great success in many
fields. Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is one of the promis-
ing directions that integrates SSL with graph representation learn-
ing [ 18,47] to derive informative and robust representations for
downstream tasks. The main idea is to conduct contrastive tasks
among representations derived from distinct graph views generated
through augmentation techniques such as edge dropout. Inspired
by this, several works have integrated GCL [ 2,50,53] into the
GNN-based SR, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing the net-
work sparsity and enriching the social semantics being modeled.
However, none of them explicitly considers the social noise, leaving
GCL’s potential to handle noisy data and enhance the robustness
of SR under-explored. Although previous studies [ 42,45] show that
GCL with edge dropout augmentation can alleviate the noise in the
user-item interaction graph, they drop each edge independently
which may not be effective for denoising in the social networks.
Specifically, the connections among users in the social network
are more complicated, as the social influence can cascade to users
who are multi-hop away. Therefore, whether a social neighbor is
noisy depends not only on the node itself but also on the indirect
neighbors. Moreover, some users may be more crucial in the infor-
mation propagation process. In particular, there is a group of users
known as Opinion Leaders (OLs), who have a stronger ability to
spread information and shape others’ opinions, as highlighted by
previous studies [ 1,13,28,46]. For example, the endorsement of
certain products by OLs can swiftly lead to adoption or interest
development among their followers. Hence, we assert that OLs
can act as a catalyst for the diffusion of social influence. This is
substantiated through our data analysis in Section 2, where we
illustrate the distinctive traits of OLs and unveil their paramount
significance, surpassing that of high-similarity neighbors, in the
influence dissemination. In light of this, two main challenges arise:
(1) how to effectively consider the cascading spread of social in-
fluence and (2) how to construct the proxy contrastive tasks for
effective self-supervised social denoising.Table 1: Performance of SR under different social setups
(w.r.t NDCG@10). We conduct paired t-tests at the user level
between each of the last four setups with " 𝑤social", which
are all significant at 1% significance level.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Self-Supervised
Denoising approach through Independent Cascade Graph Augmen-
tation (SSD-ICGA) for robust SR, guided by our observations. Specif-
ically, we adopt the Independent Cascade (IC) diffusion model [ 14]
to simulate the cascading influence diffusion in the social network.
IC traverses the original graph, activates the edges in cascade based
on learned probability, and eventually generates augmented graph
views with inactive edges dropped. To further effectively guide
the IC process toward a denoised social graph (i.e., the inactive
edges are indeed the noisy ones), we introduce i) the hierarchical
contrastive task, which prioritizes the activation by OLs neighbors,
followed by the neighbors with high preference similarity, while
deprioritizing the low-similarity neighbors; and ii) the information
bottleneck based contrastive task, which minimizes the mutual
information between the representation derived from the original
and augmented graphs while ensuring the augmented graph retains
adequate information for an enhanced SR. The main contributions
of this paper lie three-fold:
•We perform data analysis that empirically uncovers (1) the
existence of social noise and (2) the hierarchy of social influ-
ence on user preference modeling among neighbors: OLs >
high-similarity neighbors > low-similarity neighbors.
•We introduce an independent cascade-based graph augmen-
tation that simulates cascading influence spread in the social
network, seamlessly amplifying the impact of OLs and high-
similarity neighbors while weakening that of low-similarity
neighbors through a hierarchical contrastive task. Such aug-
mentation is further integrated with an information bottleneck-
based contrastive task for effective self-supervision towards
a denoised social graph, thereby facilitating robust SR.
•We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets to vali-
date the superiority of our proposed approach in terms of
its prediction accuracy and robustness to social noise.
2 DATA ANALYSIS
We first conduct an exploratory analysis on two widely used datasets
for SR, namely Epinion and Ciao1, to answer the following two
questions that motivate our study: (1) Do social networks contain
noisy connections that adversely affect user modeling? and if so,
what are the potential sources? (2) Are there any social connections
that have a more significant positive impact on user modeling?
Observation 1: Social networks contain noise, which likely originates
from connections of users with low preference similarity.
1The details of the datasets are introduced in Section 4.

In reality, we may tend to take advice from social neighbors who
have common interests with us. In other words, some neighbors
in the social networks might not have a social influence on the
user’s preference. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of preference
similarity between each pair of users in the social network. Due
to the high sparsity of user-item interactions, we represent the
preference of user 𝑢as a vector[𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑔,...], where𝑐𝑔is a binary
value indicating whether 𝑢has consumed any items from category 𝑔.
Then, for each user pair, we calculate the Jaccard similarity between
their preference vectors to measure their preference similarity. As
shown in the plot, the similarity between most social connections
falls below 0.4, with numerous connections exhibiting relatively
low similarity, especially in Epinion. These neighbors probably
exert minor social influence on the user’s preferences or even be
noise, considering the dissimilarity in their preferences.
To validate it, we train two representative social recommenders
(matrix factorization based TrustSVD [ 6] and deep learning based
DiffNet++ [ 44]) under different social setups: all social connec-
tions included (" 𝑤social"), all social connections excluded (" 𝑤/𝑜
social"), high-similarity (" 𝑤/𝑜high sim") or low-similarity (" 𝑤/𝑜
low sim") neighbors excluded, respectively. Neighbors with prefer-
ence similarity exceeding the median similarity of all neighbors are
high-similarity neighbors and those falling below are low-similarity
neighbors. The results are shown in Table 1. Firstly, we note that in-
corporating social neighbors improves the prediction performance
on Ciao but harms the performance on Epinion. This could be at-
tributed to the denser distribution of lower preference similarity
(around 0) in Epinion. Secondly, the performance of " 𝑤/𝑜low sim"
surpasses that of " 𝑤social", suggesting eliminating connections
with lower similarity improves performance. Thirdly, " 𝑤/𝑜high
sim" achieves worse performance than " 𝑤social", showcasing that
the removal of high-similarity counterparts leads to performance
decline. In summary, the above observations help verify the exis-
tence of noise in the social network, which likely originates from
low-similarity social connections.
Observation 2: Among all neighbors, Opinion Leaders (OLs) exert a
stronger positive influence on user preference modeling than ordinary
neighbors, regardless of their preference similarity with the target user.
Accordingly, we identify a hierarchy of influence among neighbors:
OLs > high-similarity neighbors > low-similarity neighbors.
In the information diffusion process, users do not contribute equally,
with some playing more crucial roles than others. For example, users
may be particularly influenced by some individuals, such as OLs
Figure 2: Comparison of the importance of OLs, high-
similarity neighbors, and low-similarity neighbors.
who possess expertise and thus have a stronger ability to shape
others’ opinions. As highlighted by previous work [ 46], OLs taking
up 1% of the total users are sufficient to spread information across
the network. Following [ 46], we use PageRank [ 23] as an indicator
of the user’s importance in the social network and choose the users
with the top 1% PageRank as the OLs2.
We then explore the distinctive traits of OLs by comparing them
with ordinary users ("Ord") across several metrics relevant to the
recommendation context, as shown in Table 2, where several find-
ings can be derived. Firstly, OLs consume more items that are of
lower popularity on average. This is probably due to their expertise
in certain fields and thereby having their preference for a wider
range of products rather than following the majority. Moreover,
they are trusted by more individuals than those whom they trust
and their consumed items are more likely to be adopted by their
neighbors, indicating that they are more trustworthy and have
a stronger ability to influence their followers. Additionally, OLs’
social in-degree and out-degree are much larger and their social
neighbors are more closely connected (higher clustering coefficient),
which facilitates a broader spread of influence. In summary, OLs are
crucial in disseminating information and shaping others’ opinions.
Thus, considering the role of OLs would enhance user preference
inference and the robustness of SR models. To support this, we train
the two representative social recommenders with OL connections
removed from the social network. The results are shown in the last
row in Table 1, which implies a more significant negative impact
than removing the high-similarity social neighbors.
Inspired by the observations that the high-similarity neighbors
have stronger positive effects on user modeling than low-similarity
neighbors, we further investigate whether this phenomenon ex-
tends to the OL connections. Specifically, we choose the group
of users (Group A) who are connected to at least one OL and re-
spectively remove each type of their connected neighbors: high-
similarity OLs (" 𝑤/𝑜high OLs"), low-similarity OLs (" 𝑤/𝑜low
OLs"), high-similarity ordinary neighbors (" 𝑤/𝑜high Ord"), and
low-similarity ordinary neighbors (" 𝑤/𝑜low Ord"). We also look at
the indirect impact on the rest users (Group B), whose neighbors
are unaffected by the changes. As depicted in Figure 23, OLs exhibit
consistent significance irrespective of their preference similarity to
2We confine the influence of OLs to users who are directly connected or reachable
through multi-hop connections.
3Due to space limitation, we put the results of TrustSVD in Appendix A, and a similar
trend can be observed as DiffNet++.

the target user, surpassing the impact of high-similarity ordinary
users, followed by low-similarity ordinary users. In other words,
there exists a hierarchy of influence: OL neighbor > high-similarity
neighbor > low-similarity neighbor. Moreover, removing OL neigh-
bors of users in Group A results in a performance decline in Group B
whereas the removal of ordinary users has a minor effect, indicating
the impact of OLs on the broader context.
3 THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
Overview of SSD-ICGA. We propose SSD-ICGA, a novel social
recommender that achieves Self-Supervised Denoising through In-
dependent Cascade Graph Augmentation. The overall structure is
depicted in Figure 3. Technically, we first propose graph augmen-
tation through the Independent Cascade (IC) diffusion model to
consider the cascade spread of social influence. Then we introduce
the hierarchical contrastive loss to amplify the role of OLs and
high-similarity neighbors while de-emphasizing the low-similarity
neighbors in the IC diffusion process. Finally, the graph augmen-
tation is further integrated with an information bottleneck based
contrastive task to seek efficient knowledge extraction by striking a
balance between preserving relevant information and abandoning
non-essential details for robust augmentation.
Problem Definition. LetU={𝑢1,𝑢2,...,𝑢𝑀}denote the set of
users andI={𝑖1,𝑖2,...,𝑖𝑁}denote the set of items, where 𝑀is the
number of users and 𝑁is the number of items. We use Kto denote
the set of OLs. Two graphs are involved: the user-item graph G𝑅and
the directed social graph G𝑆. The corresponding binary adjacency
matrices are denoted as R={𝑟𝑢𝑖}𝑀×𝑁andS={𝑠𝑢𝑣}𝑀×𝑀, where
𝑟𝑢𝑖=1if user𝑢interacts with item 𝑖, and𝑠𝑢𝑣=1if user𝑢is
connected with user 𝑣. Each user and item is associated with a
𝑑-dimensional initial ID embedding e𝑢ande𝑖, respectively. Given
G𝑅andG𝑆, the objective is to obtain denoised social graph ˜G𝑆for
robust prediction of unobserved user-item interactions in R.
3.1 Preference Modeling
For the preference modeling in G𝑅, we follow the state-of-the-art
framework LightGCN [ 10], which is a simple but effective GNN
without redundant transformation and activation:

andh𝑙+1

combined to form the final embedding in the interaction network:
h𝑢=∑︁𝐿𝑟
𝑙=0h𝑙
𝑢,h𝑖=∑︁𝐿𝑟
𝑙=0h𝑙
𝑖. (2)
3.2 Social Graph Augmentation through
Independent Cascade
Aggregating noisy edges in input graphs can compromise repre-
sentation learning of GNNs, particularly as the layer stacks deeper.
Recent works [ 42,45] reveal the potential of GCL in enhancing
the robustness of GNN-based recommenders to the user-item inter-
action noise through graph augmentation, such as edge dropout.
We argue that such augmentation is insufficient to identify thenoisy edges in the social network since it fails to consider the cas-
cading spread of influence in the social network, as analyzed in
Section 1. Hence, we leverage the stochastic information diffusion
model [ 14,16], which simulates such cascades and predicts the
information flow to generate the augmented graph view.
Specifically, we adopt the widely-used information diffusion
model - Independent Cascade (IC) [ 14], where each node in the
network has two states, either active or inactive. An initial seed
set is activated at time 𝑡=0and starts to activate their in-going
neighbors recursively at discrete time steps. In particular, at step 𝑡,
each user𝑣that is activated at step 𝑡−1will activate each in-going
inactive neighbor 𝑢with probability 𝑝𝑢𝑣. After being activated,
each node has one chance to activate its neighbors and stay active
until the diffusion process terminates with no more activations.
This stochastic process transverses the input graph sequentially
and generates augmented graphs with inactive edges removed. Dif-
ferent from the straightforward edge dropout to drop each edge
independently [ 42,45], the active or inactive edges at each time will
affect the activation in subsequent steps. For example, if 𝑢is not ac-
tivated by its noisy neighbors, the influence of such noisy neighbors
is constrained from propagating to further hops. Conversely, the
activation by valuable neighbors will facilitate further activations.
Hence, IC augmentation can better capture the cascading spread
of social influence and achieve denoised graph augmentation. It is
formulated as:
˜G𝑆=𝐼𝐶(G𝑆,A0,P), (3)
where ˜G𝑆is the denoised social graph generated by the diffusion
process; Pis the activation probability matrix, where each ele-
ment𝑝𝑢𝑣represents the probability of 𝑣activating𝑢and is learned
through a multiple layer perception (MLP):
𝑝𝑢𝑣=𝑀𝐿𝑃((W1e𝑣||W2e𝑢), (4)
where || is the concatenation operation; W1,W2∈R𝑑×𝑑are the
linear transformation matrix applied to the activater and activatee
respectively.A0is the initial active user set at 𝑡=0, where we start
from a set of OLs and sample 1% users based on the PageRank score
to increase randomness. In the original IC, each user can only be ac-
tivated by one of its neighbors. We relax it by allowing reactivation
by different neighbors, which is a more realistic reflection of the
evolving diffusion process. Finally, the propagation terminates if
either there is no activation or the 𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟is reached. Empirically,
we set𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟=5according to the six degrees of separation
theory [5]. The overall process is described in Algorithm 1.
3.3 Contrastive Learning for Denoised Social
Graph Augmentation
IC traverses the social graph, dropping inactive edges to generate
the augmented graph for robust social influence modeling. However,
the recommendation objective alone is insufficient to guide the IC
process toward a denoised social graph. To ensure the effectiveness
of the augmentation, we devise two self-supervised contrastive
tasks to facilitate an optimal social graph augmentation.
3.3.1 Hierarchical Contrastive Loss. Section 2 observes an in-
fluence hierarchy among neighbors in the social network: OLs >
high-similarity neighbors > low-similarity neighbors. To account

for this, we impose hierarchical constraints on the activation proba-
bility within the IC process, that is, the probability of activation by
OL neighbors surpasses that of high-similarity ordinary neighbors,
which further exceeds that of low-similarity ordinary neighbors.
To this end, we introduce two contrastive losses [ 11] to enforce
positive margins between the activation probability by (1) OL neigh-
bors and ordinary neighbors; (2) ordinary neighbors and unob-
served neighbors, respectively. This also indirectly prioritizes the
activation by OL neighbors over the unobserved connections. The
hierarchical contrastive loss is formulated as follows:
Lhier=∑︁
(𝑢,𝑘)∈O𝑠
1,(𝑣,𝑤)∈O𝑠
2𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑝𝑢𝑘−𝑝𝑣𝑤+𝛼𝑣𝑤,0)+
∑︁
(𝑣,𝑤)∈O𝑠
2,(𝑣,𝑤′)∈O𝑠
3𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑝𝑣𝑤−𝑝𝑣𝑤′+𝛽𝑣𝑤,0),(5)
whereO𝑠
1={(𝑢,𝑘)|(𝑢,𝑘)∈G𝑆,𝑘∈K} is the set of connections
to OLs;O𝑠
2={(𝑣,𝑤)|(𝑣,𝑤) ∈G𝑆,𝑤∉K}is the set of connec-
tions to ordinary users; O𝑠
3={(𝑣,𝑤′)|(𝑣,𝑤′)∉G𝑆,𝑤′∉K}is the
set of unobserved connections. To consider the preference simi-
larity between connected users in the hierarchy, we incorporate
adaptive margin, which depends on preference similarity, into thecontrastive loss. Specifically, 𝛼𝑣𝑤is a monotone decreasing func-
tion w.r.t the preference similarity between 𝑣and𝑤, i.e., the higher
the preference similarity, the smaller the margin. In other words, if
𝑣’s preference is similar to 𝑢, the probability of 𝑣activating𝑢should
be closer to that of an OL neighbor activating 𝑢. Similarly,𝛽𝑣𝑤is a
monotone increasing function w.r.t the preference similarity, which
helps ensure a larger margin with higher preference similarity. We
empirically choose the tempered inverse sigmoid and tempered
sigmoid as the margin function:
𝛼𝑣𝑤=𝜂
1+𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑠(h𝑣,h𝑤)/𝜃);𝛽𝑣𝑤=𝜂
1+𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑠(h𝑣,h𝑤)/𝜃),(6)
where𝑠(.)is the cosine similarity function; 𝜂is the scaling pa-
rameter and 𝜃is the temperature parameter. We further apply an
entropy regularization [ 8], a technique from reinforcement learning
to promote action diversity. This regularization is applied to the
activation probability to encourage more spread-out distribution,
preventing it from converging to a very large or small value:
Lent=−∑︁
(𝑢,𝑣)∈G𝑆𝑝𝑢𝑣log(𝑝𝑢𝑣). (7)
3.3.2 Information Bottleneck based Contrastive Loss. The
hierarchical contrastive loss focuses on the relative order of the
social connection activation. We further adopt a self-supervised
contrastive learning scheme based on the Information Bottleneck
(IB) theory to guide IC toward optimal denoised augmentation.
IB [34,35] seeks efficient knowledge extraction by striking a bal-
ance between retaining relevant information and discarding non-
essential details for downstream tasks, formulated as:
max Z𝐼(Y,Z)+(−𝛾𝐼(X,Z)), (8)
where𝐼(,)is the function that measures the mutual information
between two variables; 𝑋is the input data; 𝑌is the label for the
downstream task and 𝑍is the compressed representation of 𝑋.
The first term optimizes the performance of downstream tasks and
the second term maximizes the amount of information removed
from the original data, which are balanced by 𝛾. This principle can
be utilized to guide the augmentation by minimizing the mutual

information between the original graph and the augmented graph
while ensuring the retained social information in the augmented
graph is sufficient for the SR task. In this way, the model can learn
to drop the noisy social connections and only keep the relevant
ones for the social influence modeling.
The objective of our study can be adapted as follows:
minΘL𝑏𝑝𝑟(G𝑅,˜G𝑆;Θ)+𝛾𝐼(Z𝑠,˜Z𝑠), (9)
whereL𝑏𝑝𝑟(.)is the widely used BPR loss [ 25] for the SR task; Θ
is the parameter set; Z𝑠and ˜Z𝑠are the nodes representations in G𝑆

tance of each neighbor. Following previous work, we adopt the

where𝜏is the temperature parameter and the views of the same

3.4 Optimization and Complexity Analysis
Opitimization. The user’s representation in preference modeling
and social influence modeling are merged to derive the user’s final
representation and we use the inner product for the prediction:
¯h𝑢=h𝑢+˜z𝑢,ˆ𝑟𝑖𝑗=¯h𝑢·h𝑖. (13)
For the main SR task, the model is trained to optimize the BPR
loss [25], which is formulated as:
L𝑏𝑝𝑟=∑︁
(𝑢,𝑖+,𝑖−)∈O𝑟−ln𝜎(ˆ𝑟𝑢𝑖+−ˆ𝑟𝑢𝑖−), (14)
whereO𝑟={(𝑢,𝑖+,𝑖−)|(𝑢,𝑖+)∈R+,(𝑢,𝑖−)∈R−}is the training
set for item prediction; R+andR−are the positive and negative
sample sets, respectively. Unifying the main SR loss with the two
contrastive losses and the entropy regularization loss, the overall
training loss is defined as:
L=L𝑏𝑝𝑟+𝛾L𝑖𝑏+𝜆1Lℎ𝑖𝑒𝑟+𝜆2L𝑒𝑛𝑡+𝜆3||Θ||2
2, (15)
where𝜆1,𝜆2,𝜆3control the weights of the hierarchical contrastive
task, entropy regularization and 𝐿2regularization, respectively. The
training procedure is summarized in Appendix B.
Space Complexity. Our model follows the paradigm of LightGCN
to learn the node representation in both networks, which only
involves the user and item embeddings of size (𝑀+𝑁)×𝑑. The
addition parameters come from the activation probability modeling,
including two transformation matrices of size 2×𝑑×𝑑and theTable 3: Statistics of datasets.

is of comparable size to LightGCN and is lighter than most social
recommenders such as DiffNet++ [44] and MHCN [52].
Time Complexity. The time complexity of our model mainly
comes from three parts: (a) GCN aggregation; (b) hierarchical con-
trastive loss; and (c) IB-based contrastive loss. For (a) in both net-
works, the time cost is O((𝐿𝑟|E𝑅|+𝐿𝑠|E𝑆|)𝑑), where|E𝑅|,|E𝑆|
are the number of edges in the interaction and social networks,
respectively. For (b), the computational cost for each batch is 2𝑏𝑑.
For (c), the calculation of InfoNCE takes O(𝑏(𝑑+𝑀𝑑))in each
batch, where 𝑏is batch size. The complexity can be reduced by
performing contrast learning within the batch and the time cost
isO(𝑏(𝑑+𝑏𝑑)). Overall, since 𝐿𝑠,𝐿𝑟,𝑑,𝑏≪𝑀,|E𝑅|,|E𝑆|, the time
cost scales linearly with the user and network size.
4 EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS
4.1 Experimental Settings
4.1.1 Datasets. We conduct experiments on two commonly used
SR datasets, Epinion and Ciao [ 32], both containing user-item in-
teraction and social networks. Following state-of-the-arts [ 10,39],
we only retain the ratings that are greater than 3 and assign them
a value of 1, and the rest are negative samples and assigned a value
of 0. Moreover, we filter out users and items with less than two
interactions. The detailed statistics of the two datasets are shown
in Table 3. Following [ 10,44], all datasets are randomly split into
8:1:1 for training, validation, and testing.
4.1.2 Baselines. We compare SSD-ICGA with 12 state-of-the-art
models across three different classes, including (1) the matrix factor-
ization based methods BPR [ 25], SBPR [ 54] and TrustSVD [ 6]; (2) the
GNN-based methods LightGCN [ 10], DiffNet++ [ 44], MHCN [ 52],
GoRec [ 37], DcRec [ 43], DSL [ 38] and DMJP [ 29]; and (3) the de-
noising SR models ESRF [ 49] and GDMSR [ 24]. We do not com-
pare with baselines such as SoRec [ 19], GraphRec [ 4], SEPT [ 50]
and IF-BPR [ 48] since previous work [ 24,44,52] have validated
their superiority over them. In particular, BPR is the classic matrix
factorization-based method that optimizes BPR loss; SBPR extends
BPR by considering the ranking of items consumed by social neigh-
bors; TrustSVD models the influence of first-order social neighbors
based on SVD++; LightGCN learns the node embeddings through a
simplified GNN; DiffNet++ uses the attention mechanism to model
the high-order influence in interaction and social networks; MHCN
conducts hypergraph convolution on multiple motif-based hyper-
graphs and integrates SSL for training; GoRec elicits the opinions
from influential nodes and integrates them into the GNN; DcRec
conducts contrastive learning between the social and interaction
networks for knowledge transfer; DSL leverages SSL to effectively
transfer social signals into user modeling; DMJP learns the dis-
entangled representation in social and interaction networks for
mutual enhancement; ESRF unifies the social neighborhood gen-
eration and denoising in an adversarial training setting; GDMSR

proposes to denoise the social network that can be adapted to any
SR models and we implement MHCN following the original paper.
4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. We adopt two widely used metrics,
Recall@K and NDCG@K to evaluate the performance of all models.
Specifically, Recall@K measures whether the target is successfully
ranked in the top-K list and NDCG@K focuses on the rank of the
target item in the list. Following [ 10,39], we perform item ranking
on all non-interacted items for each user instead of the sampled
item sets to ensure an unbiased evaluation process.
4.1.4 Implementation Details. For a fair comparison, all meth-
ods are trained to optimize BPR loss with Adam [ 15] as the opti-
mizer; the batch size is fixed as 1024; the learning rate is 0.001 and
the latent embedding dimension is set to 64. Other essential hyper-
parameters are tuned using grid search based on the performance on
the validation set. We train each method for 500 epochs and adopt
the early stop strategy such that the training process terminates if
the performance on the validation set does not improve for 50 con-
secutive epochs. For SSD-ICGA4, the MLPs use the two-layer struc-
ture;𝛾is searched in{𝑒−1,𝑒−2,𝑒−3,𝑒−4};𝜆1and𝜆2are searched
in{0.01,0.1,0.5,1,5,10};𝜆3is searched in{𝑒−1,𝑒−2,𝑒−3,𝑒−4,𝑒−5};
𝜏is searched in{0.1,0.3,0.5,1}. Due to space limitation, the best
parameter settings for all methods are provided in Appendix C for
reproducibility [30, 31].
4.2 Results and Analysis
4.2.1 Overall Performance Comparison. The performance of
all methods on the two datasets is reported in Table 4. ‘Improv%’
indicates the relative improvement of SSD-ICGA (in bold) over the
strongest baseline (underlined). Several major findings can be noted.
Firstly, SSD-ICGA consistently performs the best on both datasets.
This is attributed to three aspects: (a) it achieves graph augmenta-
tion through the IC model, which captures the cascading spread of
social influence; (b) it amplifies the roles of OL and high-similarity
neighbors while de-emphasizing the low-similarity neighbors in the
information diffusion process via a hierarchical contrast task; and
(c) it further integrates the information bottleneck based GCL for
effective self-supervised denoising. Secondly, GNN-based SR mod-
els (e.g., DMJP and DSL) outperform the MF-based methods (e.g.,
SPR and TrustSVD) significantly, validating the power of GNNs in
handling graph structure data. Moreover, SSL-enhanced SR mod-
els outperform those without SSL, which verifies the effectiveness
of SSL for enhanced SR. Lastly, LightGCN, as a strong baseline,
outperforms most SR models, possibly because most SR models
directly use the social network with potential noise. It is further
confirmed by the fact that GDMSR outperforms LightGCN since
it essentially implements MHCN on a denoised social graph. This
verifies the existence of social noise, its harm on social influence
modeling, and the value of fusing denoised social networks.
4.2.2 Performance w.r.t Different Sparsity Level. To evaluate
the models’ performance at various sparsity levels, we rank all
users in ascending order based on their number of interactions and
then divide them into four groups of equal size. The performance
of SSD-ICGA and the two best-performing baselines, GDMSR and

DSL, under each group are reported in Figure 4, where SSD-ICGA
consistently outperformed other baselines across all sparsity levels.
This underscores the effectiveness of incorporating denoised social
signals, even under scenarios where interaction data are limited.
4.2.3 Robustness to Social Noise. To substantiate SSD-ICGA’s
robustness to the social noise, we contaminate the social network
by injecting different proportions of fake social connections (i.e.,
5%,10%,15%, and 20% of the total social connections) and the user-
item interaction graph remains unchanged. We compare SSD-ICDA
with the strongest baseline GDMSR (i.e., MHCN with denoised
social graph) and its backbone MHCN. The performance under
different noise levels is reported in Figure 5. Several observations
are noted. (1)Overall, the performance of all models declines to
varying degrees as more noise is added, which demonstrates SR’s
vulnerability to social noise. (2)Both SSD-ICGA and GDMSR defeat
MHCN, showcasing better performance and smaller relative drops
as the ratio of injected noise increases, suggesting the effectiveness
of denoising for robust SR. (3)SSD-ICGA consistently achieves the
highest accuracy and exhibits the smallest relative accuracy drops
with social noise injected. Moreover, the gap between SSD-ICGA
and other methods widens as the noise level increases. This indi-
cates its stronger robustness to social noise, which can be attributed
to the IC-based augmentation integrated with the two contrastive
tasks. (4)The performance of SSD-ICGA on Epinion initially in-
creases with a relatively low level of noise injected, showcasing its
ability to extract useful information from the noise to enhance SR.
However, escalating noise levels lead to a performance decline, as
the negative impact of social noise becomes dominant.
4.2.4 Ablation Study. We conduct ablation studies to validate
the efficacy of key components in SSD-ICGA. The performance is
presented in Table 5, where several findings are noted.

ates the augmented social view, which is used as the denoised graph

each edge in cascade, which better mimics the information diffu-
sion process. To examine its effectiveness, we compare its variant,
which generates the augmented view by dropping out each edge
independently based on the attention score (shortened as "SSD-
ED"). The performance decline observed in SSD-ED compared with
SSD-ICGA helps verify the effectiveness of IC in improving the
augmentation quality, thereby benefiting the SR task.
Effect of Hierarchical Contrastive Loss. It is used to prioritize
the activation by OLs and high-similarity neighbors in the infor-
mation diffusion process. To examine its effect, we remove the firstterm in Eq. 5 (" 𝑤/𝑜OL hier") and further disable this module by
removing the whole loss (" 𝑤/𝑜hier"). The performance of " 𝑤/𝑜OL
hier" is better than " 𝑤/𝑜hier", but both are defeated by SSD-ICGA,
showcasing the importance of the hierarchical contrastive task in
guiding information diffusion.
Effect of Information Bottleneck. Unlike most work [ 43,52]
that maximizes the mutual information between augmented views,
we perform IB-based GCL to minimize the mutual information
between the original and augmented views while maximizing the
relevance of the augmented view to the SR task. To examine its
effect, we compare with two variants: " 𝑚𝑎𝑥 MI" maximizing the
mutual information, and " 𝑤/𝑜IB" not performing GCL. The result
in Table 5 reveals that " 𝑚𝑎𝑥 MI" outperforms " 𝑤/𝑜IB", while both
are defeated by SSD-ICGA. Moreover, we also examine their ro-
bustness to the social noise in two settings: (1) "original" denoting
the original social network; and (2) " 𝑤noise" meaning 20% social
noise injected as described in Section 4.2.3. The results in Table 6
show that SSD-ICGA is more robust than the two variants, achiev-
ing the best performance in both settings and experiencing the
least relative performance drops when noise is injected. The above
findings verify the effectiveness of the IB-based contrastive task in
extracting relevant social signals for robust SR.
4.2.5 Hyper-parameter Sensitivity Analysis. We now investi-
gate the impact of essential parameters on SSD-ICGA, including
𝛾,𝜆1and𝜆2. In particular, the three parameters control the impor-
tance of information bottleneck based contrastive loss, hierarchical
contrastive loss, and entropy regularization. The results are plotted

in Figure 6, where we notice that the model performance w.r.t all
three parameters exhibit similar trends. Generally, as the values of
the parameters increase, the performance initially ascends, attains
an optimal level, and eventually declines. On both datasets, the best
setting for𝛾is around 0.01; and the optimal values for 𝜆1and𝜆2are
around[1,5]. This underscores the importance of setting proper
values to guarantee a more accurate SR.
4.2.6 Case study. To assess the efficacy of our independent cascade-
based graph augmentation, we perform case studies on 𝑢39from
Epinion and 𝑢174from Ciao by visualizing their activation status
by each neighbor. The results are given in Figure 7, where the
weight indicates the cosine similarity of preference embeddings of
each connected user pair. Several observations are made: (1) the
deactivated edges are mostly low-similarity ones, e.g., 𝑢274,𝑢5578
in Epinion and 𝑢82,𝑢344in Ciao; (2) Edges involving OLs are kept
despite some having low preference similarity with the target user,
e.g.𝑢51in Epinion and 𝑢216in Ciao. This behavior aligns with the
objective of hierarchical contrastive loss, which regularizes the
hierarchy of social influence, prioritizing OLs over high-similarity
neighbors and high-similarity neighbors over low-similarity neigh-
bors. The effectiveness of such hierarchical regularization has been
validated in section 4.2.4.
5 RELATED WORK
GNNs for Social Recommendation (SR). GNNs [ 9,36], as power-
ful graph representation learning methods, have found widespread
applications in recommender systems to model the complex interac-
tion between users and item [ 10,33,39]. GNNs also empower social
recommenders to model social influence and information diffusion
within the social network, including GraphRec [ 4], DiffNet++ [ 44],
DMJP [ 29] and DSL [ 38]. Besides, there are also works that combine
GNNs and hypergraphs or heterogeneous graphs to enrich the se-
mantics being modeled and enhance representation learning, such
as MHCN [ 52], SEPT [ 50] and HGCL [ 2]. However, GNNs are sensi-
tive to the quality of the input graphs. Most existing studies fail to
account for potential noise within social networks while indiscrim-
inately considering all social connections. This compromises the
robustness of SR models and undermines their recommendation
performance.
Robust Social Recommendation (SR). SR models’ vulnerability
to noise has been shown in prior studies [ 49,52] due to users’ intri-
cate social behavior, resulting in the presence of weak ties or noisysocial connections. Some attempts to mitigate this issue employ at-
tention mechanism to characterize the importance of each neighbor
like GraphRec [ 4] and DiffNet++ [ 44]. Others have resorted to dif-
ferentiating social influence by learning fine-grained disentangled
representations such as DMJP [ 29] and DSR [ 27]. However, these
methods still learn user preferences on the entire graph where weak
ties or noisy edges may undermine the quality. Thus, some works
turn to acquire a cleaner social graph for the SR task, which either
filters the noisy social connections [ 17,24,40,41] or generates
new social connections [ 49–51]. However, without ground truth
labels, both approaches rely on supervision signals derived from
the original noisy social networks. Consequently, the relevance of
preserved connections to user preference modeling remains un-
certain, and incorporating new connections may exacerbate noise
levels. Contrarily, our method denoises the social network through
self-supervised graph contrastive learning without labels.
Self Supervised Learning in Social Recommendation (SR).
Self Supervised Learning (SSL), first introduced in the field of com-
puter vision and natural language processing [ 21,26], learns from
unlabelled data through pretext tasks and data augmentation. Later
works [ 18,45] apply SSL in the graph domain to enrich graph
representation learning. The common strategy is to perform con-
trastive learning [ 12,45] between different augmented views cre-
ated through, e.g., edge dropout, node dropout, or feature shuffling.
The same idea has been extended to GNN-based recommenders to
alleviate the data sparsity issue and enhance representation learn-
ing, such as SGL [ 45] and CGI [ 42]. Recent works like MHCN [ 52],
SEPT [ 50], and HGCL [ 2] have extended the application to SR.
Specifically, SSL is mainly used to contrast between social-related
channels to enrich the social semantics and ease the data sparsity is-
sue. The potential of SSL in enhancing the robustness of SR models
to social noise is, however, under-explored.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a novel denoising social recommender,
SSD-ICGA, that achieves self-supervised social denoising for a
robust social recommendation. Specifically, we utilize the Inde-
pendent Cascade (IC) model to simulate the influence diffusion in
the social network and generate the augmented social graph for
robust social influence modeling. Through data analysis, we find
that (1) social noise likely originates from low-similarity neighbors;
(2) there exists a hierarchy of social influence among neighbors:
Opinion Leaders (OLs) > high-similarity neighbors > low-similarity
neighbors. Guided by these observations, we integrated the IC aug-
mentation with a hierarchical contrastive loss and an information
bottleneck based contrastive loss for effective self-supervision to-
ward a denoised social view. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SSD-ICGA.

A DATA ANALYSIS
Figure 8: Comparison of the importance of OLs, high-
similarity neighbors, and low-similarity neighbors.
In Section 2, we investigate the hierarchy of influence among
the OLs, high-similarity neighbors, and low-similarity neighbors,
and report the result on the DiffNet++ model in Figure 2. Figure 8
presents the result on another baseline, TrustSVD, where similar
trends can be observed.
