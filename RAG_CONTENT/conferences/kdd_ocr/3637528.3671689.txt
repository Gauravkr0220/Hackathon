ABSTRACT
The Unaligned Multi-view Clustering (UMC) problem is currently
receiving widespread attention, focusing on clustering unaligned
multi-view data generated in real-world applications. Although
some algorithms have emerged to address this issue, there still exist
the following drawbacks: 1) The fully unknown correspondence of
samples across views can significantly limit the exploration of con-
sistent clustering structure. 2) The fixed representation space makes
it difficult to mine the comprehensive information in the original
data. 3) Unbiased tensor rank approximation is desired to capture
the high-order correlation among different views. To address these
issues, we proposed a novel UMC framework termed Tensorized
Unaligned Multi-view Clustering with Multi-scale Representation
Learning (TUMCR). Specifically, TUMCR designs a multi-scale rep-
resentation learning and alignment framework, which constructs
multi-scale representation spaces to comprehensively explore the
unknown correspondence across views. Then, a tensorial multi-
scale fusion module is proposed to fuse multi-scale representations
and explore the high-order correlation hidden in different views,
which utilizes the Enhanced Tensor Rank (ETR) to learn the low-
rank structure. Furthermore, TUMCR is solved by an efficient algo-
rithm with good convergence. Extensive experiments on different
types of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
our TUMCR compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at: https://github.com/jijintian/TUMCR.

1 INTRODUCTION
Clustering is a basic task in unsupervised learning and data min-
ing, which aims to partition samples into certain categories. Many
algorithms such as 𝑘-means [ 25] and spectral clustering [ 31] have
been able to achieve satisfactory performances. However, these
methods are limited to single-view data. With the development of
data science, multi-view data is rapidly becoming a mainstream
focus in data analysis, which portrays the samples from different
perspectives. For example, human fingerprints can be recorded by
different sensors, and sculptures can be photographed from mul-
tiple views. So, multi-view clustering [ 3] aims to utilize the rich
information hidden in different views to address the shortcomings
of traditional clustering and improve clustering performance.
Many multi-view clustering methods have emerged, such as
kernel-based multi-view clustering algorithms [ 17,20,35], graph-
based multi-view clustering algorithms [ 8,16,41,44], and subspace-
based multi-view clustering algorithms[ 4,7,47], etc. These algo-
rithms can achieve satisfactory performance in some areas. How-
ever, they are carried out under ideal multi-view data (e.g., Fig. 1.
(a)). In real-world applications, due to the instability of the data
acquisition and transmission process, multi-view data often face
different degrees of problems, such as the missing problem and
the unaligned problem. The missing problem is also called the In-
complete Multi-view Clustering problem (IMC) [ 15,21,22,42,48],
which has attracted a lot of attention and brought many innova-
tive solutions. In this paper, we focus on the unaligned problem,
which is also called the Unaligned Multi-view Clustering (UMC)
problem. In most of the current studies, the UMC problem is usually
set up in two different ways and thus divided into two types of

view-aligned problem: only a portion of data is with the
known correspondence; (c) Fully unaligned problem: The
correspondence of all samples between views is unknown
due to data collection and transmission errors.
problems. The first type is called the partially view-aligned prob-
lem [ 9,37,39,45](e.g., Fig. 1. (b)), which assumes that a portion
of the samples in the multi-view data have known inter-view cor-
respondence and the rest are unknown. These problems typically
utilize known correspondence as supervised signals to predict the
correspondence of unobserved samples. For example, Zhang et al.
[45] utilize the existing inter-view constraints to obtain the mutual
information among views. Huang et al. [9] take advantage of the
aligned data to learn a neural network to establish the category-
level correspondence of the unaligned data. Yang et al. [39] propose
a noise-robust contrastive loss to ensure that aligned samples in
the representation space are pulled together while the unaligned
samples are pushed away from each other.
The second type is termed the fully unaligned problem [ 14,36,
40] (e.g., Fig. 1. (c)), which is more challenging to solve as compared
with the previous type. In this setting, the inter-view correspon-
dence of all samples is unknown. In order to solve such problems,
the hidden information in the multi-view data is usually exploited
to establish connections between views. For instance, Yu et al. [40]
explore the graph-structure consistency for all views based on the
non-negative matrix factorization framework. Lin et al. [14] use
a view-specific coupling matrix to establish the inter-view corre-
spondence in the self-representation space and adopt the low-rank
tensor learning to explore the high-order correlation among views.
Wen et al. [36] propose a novel parameter-free graph clustering
framework to refine cross-view correspondence. Although someprogress has been made by these algorithms, there are still two
main issues that need to be addressed. The first issue is that all these
methods explore the inter-view correspondence under a fixed latent
dimension, which affects the expressive ability of the model and the
establishment of intrinsic correspondence between views. The sec-
ond issue lies in devising an effective low-rank tensor constraint to
capture the high-order correlation among views in existing view fu-
sion frameworks since the Tensor Nuclear Norm (TNN) constraint
has trouble in suppressing noisy information in the representation
tensor.
Being aware of the above issues, we proposed a novel framework
to tackle the fully unaligned problem, which is termed Tensorized
Unaligned Multi-view Clustering with Multi-scale Representation
Learning (TUMCR) (Fig. 2). Specifically, TUMCR obtains multi-
scale representation matrices under the Matrix Factorization (MF)
framework, and the cross-view mapping matrices can be well estab-
lished in multi-scale spaces. Then we propose a tensorial multi-scale
fusion module to integrate representation matrices in multi-scale
spaces and explore high-order correlation among views. Specifically,
the Enhanced Tensor Rank is adopted for the low-rank structural
constraint, which leads to more compact clustering representations.
We summarize the main contributions as follows:
(1)Different from most of the existing methods, TUMCR ex-
plores the inter-view correspondence in multi-scale spaces,
which can adequately integrate the information of unaligned
multi-view data from different views, thus improving the
accuracy of the alignment and clustering.
(2)To integrate multi-scale representations, TUMCR proposes
a tensorial multi-scale fusion module, which fuses the in-
formation of different scales by assigning adaptive weights.
Then a low-rank tensor learning framework with Enhanced
Tensor Rank is adopted to explore the high-order correlation
among views.
(3)We develop an alternative optimization algorithm with good
convergence. To validate the effectiveness, we conduct ex-
tensive experiments on various datasets. The results demon-
strate the efficiency and excellent performance of TUMCR.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents notations and preliminaries. Section 3 details our proposed
method and framework. In Section 4, we present optimization,
complexity analysis, convergence analysis, and complexity analysis.
The experimental results and analysis are shown in Section 5. At
last, Section 6 concludes this paper.

2.2 Multi-view Matrix Factorization Clustering
The Matrix Factorization (MF) technique [ 2,5,26] is an effective
method for clustering, especially for high-dimensional datasets. In
single-view clustering problem, it aims to decompose the original
feature X𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒∈R𝑛×𝑑into two parts, denoted as representation
matrix Z𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒∈R𝑛×𝑐and base matrix H𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒∈R𝑐×𝑑.

{Z𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒,H𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒}L(X𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒,Z𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 H𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒), (6)
whereL(·) is the loss function that is usually measured by the
Frobenius norm [ 18]. To improve the distinguishability of the repre-
sentation matrix Z𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 , Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
[1,5] regularizes Z𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 andH𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 to be non-negative, [ 6,32]
further impose orthogonality constraints on the base matrix or
representation matrix.
Extending Eq. (6) to the multi-view clustering problem, we can
obtain the general formula of MF-based multi-view clustering meth-
ods:

improve the discriminability of representation matrices. The graph

Laplacian regularization is adopted in [ 46] to preserve the geomet-
ric structure. After learning the representation matrix Z𝑣of each
view, the consensus representation matrix Z𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑑 is obtained by
fusion strategies (i.e., linear weighted fusion method [ 34] or spectral
rotation fusion method [ 43]), which is then fed into 𝑘-means or
spectral clustering to acquire the final clustering results.
3 PROPOSE METHOD
3.1 Multi-scale Representation Learning and
Alignment
Existing unaligned multi-view clustering methods usually first map
the original features of various views into a unified space with a
group of base matrices, then explore the inter-view correspondence
in the fixed space. Thus the alignment is extremely reliant on the
representation matrices of the mapping space. However, in multi-
view data, data matrices from multiple sources usually belong to
specific latent dimensions, which means that just one feature space
alone makes it difficult to accurately characterize all views. Most
works ignore this shortcoming and simply equate it to the number
of clusters to avoid selecting the dimensions. Others tackle the
problem by introducing a hyperparameter, which increases the
computational burden during the optimization stage. To this end,
our proposed TUMCR tries to map the original features of different
views into various spaces and explore the cross-view mapping
matrices with these multi-scale representations. Specifically, we
choose𝑟groups of basis matrices {H𝑣𝑞}𝑣=1,...,𝑚
𝑞=1,...,𝑟to map the original
feature into the 𝑟spaces with dimensions {𝑑1,···,𝑑𝑟}, so we can
obtain the multi-scale representations by solving the following
problem:
min
{Z𝑣𝑞,H𝑣𝑞}𝑚∑︁
𝑣=1𝑟∑︁
𝑞=1X𝑣−Z𝑣
𝑞H𝑣
𝑞2
𝐹
𝑠.𝑡.∀𝑣,𝑞,Z𝑣
𝑞𝑇Z𝑣
𝑞=I𝑑𝑞,(8)
where Z𝑣𝑞∈R𝑛×𝑑𝑞denotes the 𝑣-th view representation matrix
in𝑞-th space. Then we need to establish the cross-view mapping
matrices. Since the complexity of searching for mapping matrices
for any two views is extremely high, a common operation is to
assign a central view to align the others. To avoid introducing
redundant complexity, an arbitrary view is randomly selected as
the central view in our proposed TUMCR, denoted as Z𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑞. So we
only need to build 𝑚cross-view mapping matrices {P𝑣}𝑚
𝑣=1, when
𝑣=𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒,P𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒=I𝑛. Then the multi-scale alignment module can
be formalized as:
min
{P𝑣}𝑚∑︁
𝑣=1𝑟∑︁
𝑞=1Z𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
𝑞−P𝑣Z𝑣
𝑞2
𝐹
𝑠.𝑡.∀𝑣,P𝑣∈{0,1}𝑛×𝑛,P𝑣1=1,P𝑣𝑇1=1,(9)
The problem in Eq. (9) is a classical NP-hard problem, so we adopt
the spectral relaxation [ 30] to simplify the problem, and taking the
multi-scale representation construction into account, the objectivefunction becomes:
min
{P𝑣,Z𝑣𝑞,H𝑣𝑞}𝑚∑︁

𝑞=I𝑑𝑞,P𝑣P𝑣𝑇=I𝑛,
(10)
where𝜃is a hyperparameter.
3.2 Tensorial Multi-scale Fusion Module
The multi-scale representation matrices {Z𝑣𝑞}𝑣=1,...,𝑚
𝑞=1,...,𝑟and the cross-
view mapping matrix P𝑣can be obtained by solving the Eq. (10),
but the representation matrices in different scales cannot be fused
directly, so we first map them into a 𝑐-dimension space by a group
of matrices{W𝑞}𝑟
𝑞=1. Since the information characterized by dif-
ferent scales has varying importance, we further introduce scale
weights 𝜷∈R𝑟×1to automatically balance the contributions of
different scales and improve the discriminative properties of the
fused representations {G𝑣}𝑚
𝑣=1∈R𝑛×𝑐,

𝑟∑︁
𝑞=1𝜷2
𝑞=1,𝜷𝑞≥0.(11)
To capture the high-order correlation among views, the low-
rank tensor framework is usually adopted. In traditional tensor-
based works, the approximation of tensor rank often employs the
commonly used Tensor Nuclear Norm (TNN), which results in
under-penalizing the smaller singular values and over-penalizing
the larger singular values. Note that the large (small) singular values
usually represent the main structural information (the noise) of
the tensor, thus TNN often derives noise residuals that disrupt the
clustering structure. Being aware of this, we adopt a noise-robust
Enhanced Tensor Rank (ETR) (Definition 3) [ 10] to approximate the
true rank of representation tensor G=Φ(G1,···,G𝑚)∈R𝑛×𝑐×𝑚,
where Φdenotes the merging operation.
Definition 3. [10] Given a tensorG∈R𝑛1×𝑛2×𝑛3, then the En-
hanced Tensor Rank (ETR) is defined as:

By simultaneously considering Eq. (10), Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), the
final objective function of our TUMCR is formulated as:

enjoys a linear time complexity O(𝑛𝑚2𝑐2).

Proof The singular value decomposition (SVD) of ˆGis denoted
asUΣV𝑇, then

The convergence of Algorithm 1 is theoretically guaranteed by the
following Theorem 3, the proof of this theorem is similar to the
convergence analysis in the work [38].
Theorem 3. Let{Y𝑘=(G(𝑘),I(𝑘),J(𝑘))}∞
𝑘=1be the sequence
generated by Algorithm 1, then the sequence {Y𝑘}∞
𝑘=1satisfies the
following two principles:
1).{Y𝑘}∞
𝑘=1is bounded.
2).Any accumulation point of {Y𝑘}∞
𝑘=1is a KKT point of Eq. (15).
4.9 Time Complexity Analysis
The mean computational complexity of TUMCR focuses on updat-
ing the variables (i.e., Z𝑣𝑞,H𝑣𝑞,P𝑣,G𝑣,W𝑞,J) in problem (15), which
takeO(𝑛𝑑2𝑞),O(𝑛𝑑𝑣𝑑𝑞),O(𝑛3),O(𝑛𝑐2),O(𝑑𝑞𝑐2)andO(𝑛𝑚𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛)+
𝑛𝑚2𝑐), respectively. So, the time complexity of TUMCR is O(𝑛3+
𝑛𝑚𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛)+𝑛𝑑𝑣𝑑𝑞).

5 EXPERIMENT
5.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets: Nine challenging datasets are adopted to validate our
TUMCR, including Yale1,MSRCv1, NGs2,BBCSport3,Caltech101-
7,100leaves4,Caltech101-205,BDGP6andCCV7. More details
can be found in Table 1. Then we randomly arrange samples in all
views excluding the central view to construct the fully unaligned
multi-view datasets.
Baselines: To validate the superiority of TUMCR, nine state-
of-the-art multi-view clustering methods are selected for com-
parison, including, AWP (2018) [ 27],GMC(2019) [ 33],EOMSC-
CA(2022) [ 19],SMVSC (2021) [ 28],AWMVC (2023)[ 32],T-UMC
(2022) [ 14] and three variations of UPMGC (i.e.,CoMSC+UPMGC,
LSR+UPMGC andGMC+UPMGC) (2023) [36], respectively.
Evaluation Metrics: We employ three commonly used met-
rics to measure the clustering quality, including accuracy (ACC),
normalized mutual information (NMI), and purity (PUR). For all
metrics, the larger values indicate better performances.

Parameter Setting: For our TUMCR, five parameters need to be
tuned,𝛼,𝛾, and𝜃are trade-off parameters to balance the importance
of different terms in the objective function, which take the range of
{10−3,···,1},{10−3,···,103}and{10−3,···,101}, respectively.
The parameter 𝛿in ETR has a search range of {0.001,0.01,0.1,1}.
The dimensions of scale space are selected from {2𝑐,3𝑐,4𝑐}. For all
datasets, we use the first view as the central view. For the baselines,
we follow the parameter settings in the corresponding literature
and report the best results. All methods use the same random seed
to obtain stable results. All the experiments are implemented on
a computer with a 2.50GHz i7-11700 CPU and 64GB RAM, Matlab
R2021a.
5.2 Clustering Performance
Table 2 displays the clustering performance of all methods on nine
challenging datasets. The best and second best results in the table
are denoted by bold value and underline value. From Table 2, we
can conclude the following interesting observations.
1) From a global perspective, our TUMCR can achieve the best
or comparable clustering performance on all nine datasets com-
pared with the other nine comparison methods. Furthermore, the
improvement of clustering performance on some datasets is also
remarkable. For example, on the MSRCv1 dataset, TUMCR out-
performs the second-best CoMSC+UPMGC methods by 16.92%,
15.96%, and 15.79%, in terms of the three metrics respectively. For
the BDGP dataset, TUMCR gains improvements around 38.39%,
36.74%, and 31.15%, respectively. These results validate its cluster-
ing ability when processing the fully unaligned data. Meanwhile,
TUMCR achieves satisfactory clustering performance for variousdata domains (e.g., text data, object data, video data, etc.), which
further shows the clustering robustness under different scenarios.
2) Not surprisingly, the multi-view clustering baselines based on
the ideal dataset (i.e., AWP, GMC, EOMSC-CA, SMVSC, AWMVC)
obtain worse clustering results than the unaligned multi-view clus-
tering methods. This is because complementarity and consensus
among views are difficult to exploit in the fully unaligned case,
and the unaligned sample information may misrepresent these
multi-view clustering baselines, producing inferior results.
3) The clustering result obtained by TUMCR is much better than
that obtained by the unaligned multi-view clustering (i.e., T-UMC,
CoMSC+UPMGC, LSR+UPMGC, GMC+UPMGC), all of which are
proposed for fully unaligned problem. From the results, we can
infer that it is better to conduct the establishment of cross-view
correspondence on the multi-scale space than on a fixed space,
the multi-scale representations can provide a more complete pic-
ture of different views, which allows the model to better capture
complementary and consistent information among views.
Visualization: To demonstrate the advantages of TUMCR in
unaligned multi-view clustering more intuitively, we provide visual-
ization graphs on the BBCSport dataset, including the ideal original
data structure of the 2-th view, the unaligned data structure of the
2-th view, the data structure of aligned representation G2, and the
unified graphs learned by the TUMCR. As seen from Fig. 3, with the
data unalignment, the real data structure in the 2-th view is severely
damaged, which makes it difficult for traditional multi-view cluster-
ing methods to mine the consistency and complementarity among
views. Then, from Fig. 3.(c), it can be noticed that the important
diagonal block structure in the original data has been recovered,
which indicates that TUMCR can effectively recover the unaligned

structure. We present the clustering graphs learned by the TUMCR,
as can be seen from the Fig. 3.(d), it has a clearer diagonal block
structure as compared to previous structures, whereas a clearer
diagonal block structure implies stronger interclass variance and
intraclass compactness. These visualization results validate that our
approach is not only effective in recovering the unaligned structure
but also in mining the intrinsic similarity between multiple views.
5.3 Model Analysis
Scale Analysis: In our TUMCR, the number of the scale spaces
𝑟={1,2,3}, and the corresponding dimensions of the scale spaces
are{2𝑐,3𝑐,4𝑐}. In order to verify the effectiveness of different scales
on clustering performance, we show the clustering results on nine
datasets using different numbers of scales, as shown in Table 3.
we can see that TUMRC achieves the best clustering results when
𝑟=2,3in most cases, which means that the perception of the
full picture of multi-view data is favored by increasing the scale
space, providing a good understanding of the consensus and com-
plementary information among views. Note that for the 100leaves
dataset, the clustering performance deteriorates with increasing 𝑟.
This phenomenon is probably caused by the fact that a single-scale
space characterizes all views well, and the multi-scale spaces may
introduce more noise to perturb the original structure.
Ablation Studies: To evaluate the effectiveness of the ETR
in TUMCR, we derive a variant, i.e.,TUMCR-TNN. TUMCR-TNN
replaces the Enhanced Tensor Rank (ETR) by tensor nuclear norm
(TNN), and the loss functions are as follows:

Fig. 5.(a) shows the ACC result of TUMCR and its variant on
nine datasets (i.e., Yale, MSRCv1, BBCSport, NGs, Caltech101-7,
100leaves, Caltech101-20, BDGP and CCV). We can observe thatTUMCR is superior to TUMCR-TNN on all datasets, which demon-
strates the effectiveness of ETR. With the benefit of ETR, we can
learn a representation tensor with a satisfactory clustering struc-
ture, which greatly facilitates subsequent clustering performance.
Parameters Analysis: Our TUMCR has four parameters 𝛼,𝛾,𝜃,

and𝛿that need to be tuned. Here, we investigate the sensitiv-
ity of TUMCR on these parameters. We first define the search
range set{10−3,···,1}for𝛼and𝛿,{10−3,···,103}for𝛾and
{10−3,···,101}for𝜃. Then, we show the clustering performance
(ACC) of the Caltech101-7 dataset in Fig. 5. We can observe that 𝛾,
𝜃and𝛼can reach a more stable performance than 𝛿. Specifically,
our method is sensitive to 𝛿because𝛿needs to adjust the strength
of the penalty for singular values in the ETR, which is essential for
learning the low-rank structure of the tensor.
Convergence Analysis: The convergence of our TUMCR is
guaranteed by the Theorem 3. Fig. 6 shows the values of stop criteria
in each iteration on eight datasets, the stop criteria used here is
Match Error (ME): ME=∥J−G∥∞. We can observe that the
values of ME rapidly tend to 0 within 20 steps and remain stable,
which indicates the excellent convergence property of our TUMCR.

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel unaligned multi-view clustering
method, termed tensorized unaligned multi-view clustering with
multi-scale representation learning (TUMCR). Distinct from exist-
ing unaligned multi-view clustering methods, TUMCR explores
the cross-view mapping matrices in multi-scale spaces, which are
constructed by the matrix factorization framework. The multi-scale
representations can characterize the full picture of multi-view data,
thus improving the accuracy of view alignment and clustering. To
fuse the information in different scales and views, TUMCR designs
a tensorial multi-scale fusion module, which employs an adaptive
weighting approach to integrate different scales and adopts thelow-rank tensor framework with Enhanced Tensor Rank to ex-
plore the high-order correlation among views. Furthermore, an
efficient optimization method is designed to address the objective
function. Extensive experiments are performed on nine challenging
