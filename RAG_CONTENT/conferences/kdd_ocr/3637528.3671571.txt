ABSTRACT
Deep Recommender Systems (DRS) are increasingly dependent on
a large number of feature fields for more precise recommendations.
Effective feature selection methods are consequently becoming
critical for further enhancing the accuracy and optimizing storage
efficiencies to align with the deployment demands. This research
area, particularly in the context of DRS, is nascent and faces three
core challenges. Firstly, variant experimental setups across research
papers often yield unfair comparisons, obscuring practical insights.
Secondly, the existing literature’s lack of detailed analysis on selec-
tion attributes, based on large-scale datasets and a thorough com-
parison among selection techniques and DRS backbones, restricts
the generalizability of findings and impedes deployment on DRS.
Lastly, research often focuses on comparing the peak performance
achievable by feature selection methods. This approach is typically
computationally infeasible for identifying the optimal hyperpa-
rameters and overlooks evaluating the robustness and stability of
these methods. To bridge these gaps, this paper presents ERASE, a
comprehensive bEnchmaRk for feAture SElection for DRS. ERASE
comprises a thorough evaluation of eleven feature selection meth-
ods, covering both traditional and deep learning approaches, across
four public datasets, private industrial datasets, and a real-world
commercial platform, achieving significant enhancement. Our code
is available online1for ease of reproduction.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recommender systems have become indispensable in many sectors
ranging from e-commence to content streaming in the realm of in-
formation explosion [ 37,38]. With the application of deep learning
techniques, Deep Recommender System (DRS) exhibits amplified
prediction ability of user preference, providing personalized expe-
rience and dominating the deployment landscape [7, 16, 43].
To improve the accuracy of recommendations, DRS is progres-
sively integrating an expanding array of feature fields into their
predictive models, which can number in the hundreds or even thou-
sands [ 19]. The significance of each feature varies, resulting in the
accumulation of superfluous or extraneous features. Consequently,
feature selection, which concentrates on pinpointing and leverag-
ing the most critical features, is becoming increasingly crucial in
modern DRS [ 5,52]. One immediate benefit of feature selection is
the enhancement of prediction performance, achieved by eliminat-
ing non-contributory features that could otherwise adversely affect
predictions. From an industrial viewpoint, selecting predictive fea-
tures is also essential for meeting deployment criteria regarding
memory usage since unnecessary storage demands can often be
inflated by the presence of redundant features.
Hand-crafted feature selection usually requires lots of expert
knowledge and labor efforts, which is usually infeasible to achieve
5194

optimal results when the candidate set contains thousands of fea-
tures. Researchers have designed various methods to automatically
select predictive features, including statistical methods [ 31,41,42],
learning methods [ 4,6,13], and agent-based methods [ 10,34,50].
Despite the satisfactory results these methods achieved, they also
reveal the following issues hindering the development of this field:
•Experimental Differences. Recent years have witnessed a va-
riety of methods designed for DRS [ 17,26,29,35,44–46]. How-
ever, these works conduct experiments with varied settings. For
example, MultiSFS [ 44] is designed to select features for multi-
task DRS. SHARK [ 46] suggests the feature selection method
F-permutation and a quantization method. Optfs [ 35] selects the
feature from the value-level while others mainly select from the
field-level. These experimental differences usually lead to unfair
or unavailable comparisons, making the subsequent researchers
struggle to generate practical insights.
•Insufficiency. Existing feature selection benchmarks are pre-
dominantly tailored for conventional downstream tasks, such as
classification [ 2,3]. They are primarily built upon synthetic or
domain-specific datasets [ 1,9,12], which diverges significantly
from the complex, large-scale datasets encountered in DRS. This
divergence results in a notable deficiency in guiding feature se-
lection specifically for DRS, due to the benchmarks’ disparate
scope and focus. DeepLasso [ 8], while being among the bench-
marks most closely related to DRS, primarily addresses tabular
learning—a context that, despite similarities, does not fully align
with the intricacies of recommendation tasks. Furthermore, such
benchmarks often limit their exploration to traditional selection
methods and rely on datasets of a much smaller scale, thereby
omitting crucial, in-depth analysis from an industrial perspective
for DRS. Moreover, while related literature surveys [ 5,52] pro-
vide comprehensive reviews of the field, they fall short in offering
empirical evidence or experimental results that could motivate
practical deployments in DRS, lacking the necessary data-driven
support to inform and inspire future research directions.
•Assessment Deficit. A pivotal hyperparameter for feature se-
lection methods is the number of features to be selected, denoted
as𝑘in this study. Feature selection methods often exhibit signifi-
cant variability in performance across different values of 𝑘, and
the optimal 𝑘is not the same for all methods [ 29,35,45]. This
variability on 𝑘introduces two significant challenges in evalu-
ating feature selection methods. First, the direct comparison of
methods at their respective optimal 𝑘may not constitute a fair
assessment. Such comparisons fail to account for the different
memory requirements associated with varying optimal 𝑘val-
ues for different selection methods. Furthermore, this approach
neglects the performance variability under sub-optimal hyperpa-
rameter settings, thereby obscuring insights into the methods’
robustness and stability across a range of 𝑘values. Second, the
exhaustive search for the optimal 𝑘across the entire spectrum
of possible values is time-consuming and computationally in-
tensive. This necessitates an evaluation methodology capable of
effectively assessing a method’s performance based on partial 𝑘
values, offering a more efficient means to gauge feature selection
effectiveness without finishing complete iterations.To address these issues, we propose ERASE, a comprehensive
bEnchmaRk for feAture Selection for DRS. ERASE initiates a uni-
fied and fair experimental framework, minimizing experimental
discrepancies across various selection methods. Remarkably, ERASE
pioneers as the first feature selection benchmark with a focus on
DRS tasks, incorporating both prevalent DRS feature selection tech-
niques and conventional methods. It introduces a novel taxonomy to
classify these methods and unearth intrinsic patterns among groups
of methods. By evaluating the performance on widely used public
datasets and authentic industrial production datasets—through both
offline comparison and online testing—ERASE furnishes strong em-
pirical support, facilitating the generation of actionable insights.
In its endeavor to provide a comprehensive assessment of feature
selection methods, ERASE contrasts the optimal performance of
compared selection methods alongside their outcomes under spe-
cific deployment prerequisites. Additionally, we introduce a novel
metric, AUKC, specifically crafted for assessing the robustness and
stability of feature selection methods across a range of feature
quantities𝑘, thereby addressing the critical lack of such evaluative
metrics. We summarize our major contributions as follows:
•We present ERASE, a comprehensive benchmark for DRS feature
selection methods, providing a fair comparison for emerging
selection techniques with various datasets and DRS backbones.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on bench-
marking feature selection methods for recommendation tasks.
•We recognize the assessment shortfall linked to the substantial
dependency of selection efficacy on the hyperparameter 𝑘, and
in response, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, AUKC. This
metric is designed to evaluate the robustness and stability of fea-
ture selection methods, bridging the existing gap in assessment.
•We carry out thorough experiments across four widely used
public datasets and real-world industrial production datasets,
yielding insights from various angles. Notably, our experimen-
tal findings have guided optimizations in our online platform,
achieving a 20% reduction in latency without compromising ef-
fectiveness, validating the practical utility of our benchmark.
2 BECNCHMARK DESIGN
In this section, we will give an overview of our benchmark. As
shown in Figure 1, the benchmark consists of four components:
dataset, feature selection methods, backbone models, and metrics.
2.1 Datasets
To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of different feature
selection methods, we select four public datasets for our exper-
iments. Avazu2andCriteo3are selected because they are fre-
quently used dataset for studying feature selection in DRS [ 29,
35,45]. To compare the performance of different methods with a
small feature set, we choose the popular Movielens-1M4dataset
in the recommendation field. Additionally, to compare the per-
formance of different methods in scenarios closer to real-world
recommender systems, we supplement with the AliCCP5dataset,

Figure 2: Overview of three categories of feature selection methods in deep recommender systems. Shallow methods typically
use statistical algorithms to assign feature importance to each field. Gate-based methods, on the other hand, assign gates to
feature embeddings and consider the gate values as the importance of the corresponding features. Sensitivity-based methods
derive parameter sensitivity from backward propagation steps and calculate feature importance accordingly.
3. Sensitivity-based Feature Selection
•Permutation [ 11].Permutation works by randomly permut-
ing the feature values at a time and measuring how much this
permutation affects the performance of the model.
•SHARK [ 46].Shark takes the novel first-order component of
Taylor expansion as the feature importance score for model pre-
diction. It then prunes those features with lower scores from the
embedding table to improve model performance and efficiency.
•SFS [ 44].SFS takes the gradients of the gate for each feature
field as the feature importance score. It is a two-stage method
and selects on the feature field level.
2.3 Backbone Models
To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of feature selection
methods, we choose four popular DRS models as backbones: 1)
Wide&Deep : A classical model contains shallow and deep net-
works to capture feature interactions. 2) DeepFM : A model with
FM module to automatically learn feature interactions. 3) DCN : A
model with cross layers to study feature interactions. 4) FibiNet : A
model equipped with SENet and bilinear layer to adaptively learn
feature importance and capture high-order feature interactions.
The detailed introduction of these models is in Appendix B.
2.4 Metrics
In this paper, we focus on the Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction
task, so we take AUC and Logloss as the two main metrics in our
benchmark. The detailed introduction is in Appendix C. Addition-
ally, since there is currently no metric that comprehensively evalu-
ates the performance of feature selection methods across varying
numbers of selected features, we propose a new evaluation metric
named “AUKC” to address this challenge.
AUKC. Current metrics cannot assess the robustness and stability
of a specific feature selection method across different numbers of
selections. Therefore, we introduce a new metric Area Under the𝐾-performance Curve (AUKC) to fill this gap. AUKC measures the
area under the performance curve of feature selection methods
with different 𝐾. Specifically, AUKC is formalized as follows:
𝐴𝑈𝐾𝐶 =1
|𝐾||𝐾|∑︁
𝑘=1(𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘+𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘−1−1) (1)
where|𝐾|denotes the number of all feature fields, 𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘is the
AUC score when selecting 𝑘feature fields follow a specific feature
selecting method. If there are no input features, the model would
make random predictions so that 𝐴𝑈𝐶 0=0.5.
In practice, due to resource constraints, it is generally not feasible
to conduct experiments with every possible number of selections.
Therefore, we further propose a more general form of AUKC to
accommodate this change:
𝐴𝑈𝐾𝐶 =1
|𝐾||𝑁|∑︁
𝑛=1(𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑙+𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑟−1)×Δ𝑙𝑛 (2)
where|𝐾|denotes the number of all feature fields and |𝑁|is the
number of segments across the entire length of the feature fields set.
𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑙is the AUC corresponding to the number of features selected
at the left endpoint of the 𝑛-th segment, and 𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑟denotes the
AUC with the number of selections at the right endpoint of the
𝑛th segment. Δ𝑙𝑛represents the length of the 𝑛-th segment. The
detailed process of the formula derivation is in Appendix D.
AUKC and AUC share a similar conceptual basis, representing
the area under a curve, and both have a value range from 0 to 1.
However, unlike AUC, the endpoint of AUKC does not necessar-
ily equal 1, and the values in the middle of the curve can exceed
the endpoint value. This occurs because eliminating features with
less information can result in a model that performs better than
one using all available features. The AUKC metric considers the
effectiveness of feature selection at different numbers of selected
features,𝑘, thereby providing a more comprehensive reflection of
the efficacy of feature selection methods.

3 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we will provide extensive experimental results to
answer following research questions:
•RQ1: In a fair and unified environment, how do different feature
selection methods perform?
•RQ2: How do feature selection methods perform in terms of
robustness and stability across various numbers of selections?
•RQ3: How is the efficiency of feature selection methods?
•RQ4: Do the performances of feature selection methods align
between large-scale industrial datasets and public datasets?
•RQ5: Do the performances of feature selection methods remain
consistent online and offline?
•RQ6: What is the relationship between feature rankings of dif-
ferent feature selection methods?
3.1 Experimental Details
We implement the benchmark framework based on Pytorch 1.11.
In the training phase, we utilize the Adam optimizer with 𝛽1=0.9,
𝛽2=0.999, and𝜖=1×10−8. We set the learning rate as 0.001, the
batch size as 4,096, and the embedding size as 8. For the activation
function, if the original papers do not emphasize a specific one,
we use ReLU as the activation function. We release the repository
of our benchmark online6. We conduct each experimental setting
three times and record its average metrics to mitigate the impact
of experimental fluctuations.
3.2 Overall Performance (RQ1)
In this subsection, we compare the performance of feature selection
methods with different backbone models. The complete experimen-
tal results for all four backbone models are illustrated in Appen-
dix E. For the two-stage approaches (Lasso, GBDT, RF, XGBoost,
AutoField, Permutation, SHARK, and SFS), we experiment with
different values of selected features during the retraining stage and
adopt the best results. In the case of the single-stage approach, if it
can also be modified to a two-stage method (OptFS and LPFS), we
conduct experiments on both ways and record the optimal results;
if it only supports single-stage (i.e., AdaFS), we directly document
its results. From Table 2, we can observe the following points:
•In general, gate-based methods show better performance com-
pared to shallow feature selection and sensitivity-based feature
selection. The likely reason is that compared to using traditional
machine learning methods or solely relying on gradient informa-
tion, leveraging the powerful expression and learning capabilities
of deep neural networks allows for a more thorough exploration
of feature importance.
•The effectiveness of feature selection methods remains relatively
consistent across different backbone models. This is because the
information contained in feature combinations is objective and
factual and is not affected by the backbone model.
•The validity of feature selection methods is distinct across dif-
ferent datasets. The shallow feature selection methods perform
better in Criteo and Aliccp. The possible reason is the feature
value distribution in the other two datasets is very imbalanced,
making shallow models prone to overfitting. Gate-based feature
6https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/ERASEselection methods are good at dealing with limited data, while
sensitivity-based feature selection methods achieve the best per-
formance among all methods in datasets with rich samples. This
finding can be attributed to the fact that in the data-scarce sce-
nario, gradients are too sensitive to judge feature importance.
However, with sufficient data support, the stability of gradient
information will be greatly improved, allowing for more accurate
feature importance rankings.
•The two-stage approach yields more stable results compared
to the single-stage method across different backbone models.
This is because the feature combinations filtered out by the two-
stage method can exist independently after the search phase,
whereas the single-stage method requires retraining the feature
importance scores with each training session.
3.3 Stability Evaluation (RQ2)
In this section, we conduct experiments on each backbone model
with different number of selected features 𝑘to investigate their
robustness and stability. Specifically, we iterate a specific list for 𝑘
(e.g.,[5,10,15,17,19,21]for Avazu) and record the corresponding
performance of feature selection methods. Then, the stability of
feature selection methods can be revealed from two perspectives,
visual patterns of the performance curve (Figure 3) and AUKC
values calculated as Equation (1) (Table 3).
In Figrue 3, the x-axis represents the number of selected features
𝑘and the y-axis represents the evaluation metrics AUC or Logloss.
We only visualize the results of DeepFM, for we find that the trends
for different backbone models remain consistent. The detailed ex-
perimental results for the other backbone models are listed in our
released repository. In addition, it is worth noting that to make
OptFS applicable in this experiment, we assign importance scores
to features based on the drop rates of feature values in each feature
field. From Figure 3, we can find:
•The effectiveness of features selected by different methods varies
in ranking when the number of selections changes. Specifically,
when the number of features selected is smaller (i.e., 5 or 10),
Autofield, SHARK, and SFS perform better. They obtain infor-
mation through the values or gradients of gate vectors, guiding
the sorting of feature importance. They are good at selecting the
most informative features from the candidate feature sets. OptFS
doesn’t initially perform well, as it is inherently a single-stage
method. Modifying it to a two-stage method based on different
feature value drop rates may not align with the goal of enhanc-
ing effectiveness through feature selection. When the number
of features approaches the full set of features, the Permutation
method performs well. This is because the permutation method
calculates feature importance scores based on the loss of effect
caused by dropping a feature from the full set. It tends to identify
redundant features with less information.
•The XGBoost and GBDT methods show different trends on the
Avazu and Criteo datasets. Specifically, they perform poorly on
the Avazu dataset but well on the Criteo dataset. This is be-
cause the Avazu dataset’s feature values are concentrated in a
few feature fields, leading to an imbalance that makes XGBoost
and GBDT prone to overfitting, which affects the assessment of
feature importance [40].

e 3: Experimental results of feature selection methods with DeepFM backbone, evaluated by AUC and Logloss.
To offer a more direct comparison of the stability, we evaluate
the selection results using the AUKC metric. Table 3 shows AUKC
results on Avazu and Criteo. We can conclude:
•Overall, sensitivity-based feature selection methods outperform
gate-based feature selection methods, both of which are superior
to shallow feature selection methods. The possible reason is that
gradient-based methods calculate feature importance based on
partial batches, which helps to prevent overfitting. The inferior
performance of shallow methods may be attributed to their ex-
cessive simplicity, which cannot effectively capture the complex
relationships between features to determine feature importance.•Regarding specific methods, AutoField, SHARK, and SFS exhibit
the best performance, demonstrating leading effects across dif-
ferent datasets. It is noteworthy that AutoField significantly sur-
passes other gate-based feature selection methods. This may be
attributed to AutoField being trained in a bi-level optimization
manner, which reduces the risk of overfitting, making the selec-
tion results more stable and reliable.
3.4 Efficiency Analysis (RQ3)

3.4.1 Experiments with performance limitations. In real-world sce-
narios, an important consideration is reducing the memory usage of
a model as much as possible while ensuring its effectiveness. To test
the memory-saving capabilities of different methods under the con-
straint of maintaining effectiveness, experiments were conducted
on two classic DRS datasets, Avazu and Criteo, using DCN as the
backbone model. Firstly, we calculate an acceptable threshold for
effectiveness based on the baseline performance of the backbone
model (without feature selection, using the full set of features),
considering a 1% loss in AUC as acceptable. The threshold is AUC
0.77873 for Avazu and AUC 0.79245 for Criteo. Based on the feature
importance ranking list obtained in the search phase by different
feature selection methods, we select features from highest to lowest
importance until the model’s performance exceeds the threshold.
We record the number of features and feature values required to
reach this lower threshold of effectiveness for each feature selection
method. Since most parameters in DRS models are concentrated in
the embedding table, we only considered the memory usage of the
embedding table when calculating the memory models required.
From Table 4, we can conclude that:
•From the perspective of memory usage, methods like AutoField,
LPFS, Permutation, SHARK, and SFS perform better. This indi-
cates that even in DRS scenarios rich in high-dimensional sparse
features, these methods do not rely solely on ID-type features
(e.g., userid). Instead, they effectively select informative features.
It’s noteworthy that AdaFS shows 100% memory usage on both
datasets. This is because AdaFS is an instance-level selectionTable 5: Experimental results with memory limitations.

method (where gate weights vary with each input sample), and
therefore cannot save memory usage.
•In terms of the number of features, RF, AutoField, LPFS, SHARK,
and SFS only require half or fewer of the original feature set
to achieve 99% of the backbone model’s performance. On the
other hand, GBDT and XGBoost need more features. A possible
reason for this is that GBDT and XGBoost are prone to overfitting
in high-dimensional sparse DRS datasets, which can affect the
judgment of feature importance.
•From the perspective of the datasets, the memory-saving effec-
tiveness of various methods is less pronounced on the Avazu
dataset compared to the Criteo dataset. This is because most
feature values in the Avazu dataset are concentrated in just a
few feature fields, whereas in Criteo, the feature values are more
evenly distributed. Therefore, when these particular feature fields
are indispensable sources of information for CTR prediction, the
memory-saving effect becomes less noticeable.
3.4.2 Experiments with memory limitations. Maximizing effective-
ness within limited memory is also an important application sce-
nario for feature selection. To test the capability of different methods
in feature selection under memory constraints, experiments were
conducted on the Criteo dataset using DCN as the backbone model.
The memory limits were categorized into three levels: 25% memory,
50% memory, and 75% memory. Specifically, since the parameters
in DRS are mostly concentrated in the embedding table, we used
the memory usage of the full feature set’s embedding table as a
reference. We set thresholds at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total mem-
ory to record the optimal performance achievable under memory
constraints by different feature selection methods. Since AdaFS is
incapable of performing a hard selection of partial feature fields, it

Figure 4: K-performance figure on industrial dataset
is not included in this experiment. Based on the results presented
in Table 5, we can draw the following conclusion:
•Overall, gate-based feature selection and sensitivity-based feature
selection methods perform better. Even when restricted to using
only 25% of the available memory, they can achieve results close
to those obtained using the full set of features. This is because
these methods rely on more powerful deep learning networks
that can better model feature importance and are not dependent
on high-dimensional sparse ID-type features in DRS.
•Specifically, AutoField achieves the best results because its de-
signed controller effectively learns the importance of each field
for the prediction outcome. The DARTS (Differentiable Architec-
ture Search) [ 32] parameter updating manner made the learning
of the gate vector more robust and capable of generalization. In
contrast, Random Forest (RF) performs the worst. This is because,
in the context of high-dimensional sparse DRS, RF tends to assign
high weights to ID-type features with numerous feature values.
Such feature fields offer more opportunities for splitting, which
facilitates the training of RF. However, this approach increases
the risk of model overfitting. This tendency of RF to favor features
with many splitting points can lead to a bias towards complex,
less generalizable models that don’t necessarily capture the most
predictive or relevant features for the task at hand.
3.5 Offline Results on Industrial Dataset (RQ4)
To find whether our conclusions for feature selection methods align
between large-scale industrial datasets and public datasets, we
conduct comparison experiments on large-scale industrial datasets.
3.5.1 Industrial Dataset. The dataset is constructed with sampled
CVR records from 2023-11-29 to 2023-11-30 containing approxi-
mately seven hundred million samples. The feature used in thisoffline dataset is aligned with the online service model, which con-
tains over 157 features. All of these features have been roughly
proved useful in offline leave-one-out experiments.
3.5.2 Experiment. Considering the industry dataset is relatively
huge, we only select the top 5 elite methods for comparison ac-
cording to their performance on public datasets, including two
gate-based methods (AutoField and LPFS) and three sensitivity-
based methods (SHARK, Permutation, and SFS).
The feature preprocessing is slightly different from the public
dataset. Specifically, we utilize AutoDis [ 15] technique to directly
convert dense features into embeddings with the same size as sparse
features. As for multi-hot features, we adopt the reduce-mean oper-
ator to aggregate multiple embeddings into one feature embedding.
Finally, the preprocessed features are fed into the FibiNet backbone.
After training, we grab each method’s feature importance and
perform top-k experiments. The experiment result is demonstrated
in Table 6 and Figure 4. From the redundant feature elimination
perspective, SHARK, AutoField, and Permutation perform the best.
They eliminate about half of the feature sets (80 features) without
decreasing model accuracy. However, from an effective feature
mining perspective, AutoField performs best for small feature sets,
aligning with our observations from the public datasets. We can
also find that AutoField achieves the highest AUKC in Table 6,
demonstrating its robustness and stability across different numbers
of selections. LPFS’s performance is slightly misaligned with the
one on the public dataset. We attribute this misalignment to the
sensitive learnable polarization module.
3.6 Online Experiments (RQ5)
To validate the effectiveness of our benchmark in online environ-
ments, we reconfigure partial benchmarks to adapt to our feature
factory, package them into a new toolkit, and conduct online tasks
with this toolkit for redundant feature elimination tasks.
Specifically, we create an experiment group that reduces 30% fea-
tures with our toolkit in a latency-sensitive online recommendation
platform. Then, we deploy the experimental group for the A/B test
with 5% traffic (approximately 1 million users). After one week’s
observation, the inference latency was reduced by approximately
20% while the number of video views (vv) and average play duration
remained the same. This experiment proves the effectiveness of our
benchmark toolkits in the online environment.
3.7 Similarity Visualization (RQ6)
In this section, we visualize the similarity between feature rank-
ings of different feature selection methods in DRS across 4 public
datasets. Figure 5 shows the heatmap of pair-wise Spearman corre-
lation similarities. In the heatmap, the x-axis and y-axis represent
different feature selection methods. The color of each square indi-
cates the level of similarity. The more the color leans towards dark
green, the more similar between the feature rankings derived from
the two feature selection methods. Conversely, the more the color
leans towards light green, the greater the difference in the feature
rankings selected by the two methods.
We can discern the following information from the heatmap:
1) The heatmap displays three darker clusters in the upper left,
middle, and lower right. This is because the features selected by

the three different category methods are more similar within each
category. 2) The rankings of LPFS and OptFS are highly similar. This
is because they are both gate-based methods and use the L0 regular-
ization term to control the sparsity of the gates. 3) The rankings of
AutoField and Permutation are the most dissimilar. This aligns with
our conclusion in Section 3.3. AutoField, as a gate-based method,
determines feature importance by learning the gate weights of dif-
ferent feature fields during the model’s training process, aiding in
uncovering features rich in information. On the other hand, Per-
mutation, as a sensitivity-based feature selection method, judges
feature importance based on the loss of effect caused by shuffling a
particular feature. This approach is more conducive to identifying
features with less information. Therefore, their rankings show sig-
nificant differences. 4) The rankings of SHARK and SFS are quite
similar because they both determine feature importance based on
the gradient of the features, sharing the same source of information.
4 RELATED WORKS
Feature Selection Methods. Machine learning has shown supe-
rior results in data mining [ 21–25,28,47]. The modeling perfor-
mance relies heavily on input features, making feature selection
a crucial part of feature engineering. Traditional feature selection
methods fall into three categories: filter, wrapper, and embedded
methods [ 18]. Filter methods utilize criteria to identify predictive
feature fields, exemplified by the Chi2 score [ 31] and mutual infor-
mation [ 42]. Wrapper methods employ black-box models to select
predictive features, assessing the utility of feature subsets through,
often, generic algorithms [ 14,39]. Embedded methods, on the other
hand, integrate the feature selection process within the prediction
model, thereby evaluating the effectiveness of feature subsets in
conjunction. Notable embedded methods include LASSO [ 41] and
Gradient Boosting Machine [ 13]. The advent of deep learning has
spurred novel approaches [ 5,27,30,33,48,49,51], such as gate-
based methods, where learnable gates determine the significance
of feature fields [ 26,29,35,45], and sensitivity-based methods,leveraging gradient techniques to identify critical features by their
sensitivity [ 11,44,46]. Furthermore, some studies explored rein-
forcement learning to automate feature selection, using agents to
pinpoint predictive features [10, 34, 50].
Considering their appliability to DRS, our benchmark focus on
traditional embedded methods (termed “shallow methods”), along-
side gate-based and sensitivity-based methods. Other techniques
often fall short in terms of effectiveness or efficiency within the
DRS context. Specifically, filter methods might overlook the DRS
model’s nuances by relying solely on data-intrinsic relationships,
leading to suboptimal outcomes. Besides, wrapper and reinforce-
ment learning methods, typically designed for smaller datasets,
become impractically time-consuming for the expansive datasets
characteristic of DRS, which can encompass millions of samples.
Benchmarks for Feature Selection. Most existing benchmarks
are tailored for classical downstream models [ 2,3] and rely on syn-
thetic or domain-specific datasets [ 1,9,12]. Due to their constrained
relevance, these benchmarks frequently fall short in providing the
necessary guidance to propel research forward in the domain of
DRS feature selection. The most related work, DeepLasso [ 8], con-
fines its evaluation to shallow methods and a narrow set of back-
bone models, primarily targeting tabular learning tasks. Despite
utilizing real-world datasets, the scale of these datasets pales in com-
parison to those encountered in DRS scenarios, thus limiting the
provision of actionable insights for DRS feature selection strategies.
ERASE undertakes a thorough evaluation of shallow, gate-based,
and sensitivity-based methods across an array of representative DRS
backbones, leveraging both large-scale public datasets and private
industrial datasets. Furthermore, ERASE proposes a novel metric
designed to assess feature selection efficacy comprehensively.
5 CONCLUSION
In this study, we introduce ERASE, a comprehensive bEnchmaRk
for fe Ature SElection for deep recommender systems (DRS). ERASE
integrates a broad spectrum of feature selection methods pertinent
to DRS and ensures fair and comprehensive experimentation across
four public datasets as well as real-world industrial datasets. Fur-
thermore, ERASE pioneers the adoption of the AUKC metric, de-
vised to address the shortcomings of existing metrics by offering
a thorough evaluation of the robustness and stability of feature
selection methods over various numbers of selected features. The
empirical validation provided by both offline and online analyses on
industrial datasets underscores the applicability of our findings in
practical settings, offering valuable perspectives on the deployment
of feature selection methods within DRS environments.

A DATASETS
In this subsection, we introduce the datasets utilized in our bench-
mark. The statistics of these datasets are listed in Table 7. We select
the following four datasets for use:
•Avazu. Avazu is a commonly used dataset in the field of feature
selection for deep recommendation systems. It consists of 23
features and 40,428,967 interaction records. We divide the dataset
into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 ratio.
•Criteo. Criteo is another frequently used dataset for studying
feature selection in Deep Recommendation Systems. The Criteo
dataset contains 45,850,617 samples and 39 features, offering a
larger number of features. We also adopt a 7:2:1 ratio for dividing
the data into training, validation, and test sets to train the model.
•Movielens-1m. The Movielens dataset is a well-known public
movie dataset in the field of recommendation systems, featuring
multiple variants with different data volumes to meet diverse
research needs. We choose the Movielens-1M dataset, which
comprises 9 features. The limited number of features presents a
greater challenge for feature selection methods. In our experi-
ments with Movielens, we also divide the dataset into training,
validation, and test sets according to a 7:2:1 ratio. The interactions
with a rating bigger than 3 are considered as positive samples.
•AliCCP. Alibaba Click and Conversion Prediction (AliCCP) dataset
is extracted from the real-world e-commerce platform Taobao. It
is a popular dataset used for Click-Through Rate (CTR) estima-
tion. It consists of 23 features and 85,316,519 samples, making
it an effective tool for evaluating feature selection methods in
scenarios closely resembling real advertising contexts. We follow
the original AliCCP splitting approach [ 36], allocating 50% of
the data for training, with the remaining data split equally into
validation and test sets in a 1:1 ratio.
B BACKBONE MODELS
we apply a variety of feature selection methods to the following
four popular deep recommendation models in this work.
•Wide&Deep [ 7].Wide and Deep (Wide&Deep) model is devel-
oped by Google to improve the recommender systems. It com-
bines wide and deep models to fit specific feature combinations in
large-scale datasets and previously unseen feature combinations
through low-dimensional dense embeddings.•DeepFM [ 16].DeepFM is an effective model in recommender
systems. It combines the strengths of FM models and deep neural
networks to extract both low-order feature interactions and high-
order feature interactions.
•DCN [ 43].The Deep & Cross Network (DCN) model is proposed
by Google to capture both explicit and implicit feature interac-
tions for prediction tasks. The cross layers have cross operations
that learn complex feature interactions to improve the prediction
performance.
•FibiNet [ 20].The Feature Importance and Bilinear feature Inter-
action NETwork (FibiNet) is an innovative model in CTR predic-
tion. It introduces the SENET and bilinear layer. SENET learns
feature importance adaptively and the bilinear layer captures
high-order feature interactions.
C METRICS
In this section, we detail the two frequently used metrics in recom-
mender systems: AUC and Logloss.
1)AUC. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) measures the area
under the ROC curve. The ROC curve is one graph shows that the
classification performance of the model under different thresholds.
In addition, in random positive-negative pairs, AUC also represents
the probability that the model ranks the positive sample with a
higher score than the negative one. It can be formalized as follows:
𝐴𝑈𝐶 =Í𝑀
𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖−𝑀(1+𝑀)/2
𝑀×𝑁, 𝑖∈𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 (3)
where𝑀denotes the number of positive samples and 𝑁is the
number of negative samples.
2)Logloss. Logloss is also named Binary Cross-Entropy Loss,
it is always used in binary classification tasks. The formula for
Logloss is described as follows:
𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =−1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1[𝑦𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑔(ˆ𝑦𝑖)+(1−𝑦𝑖)𝑙𝑜𝑔(1−ˆ𝑦𝑖)] (4)
where𝑁is the number of samples, 𝑦𝑖denotes the predicted label
for𝑖th sample, and ˆ𝑦𝑖denotes the ground truth for 𝑖th sample.
D FORMULA DERIVATION OF AUKC
In this section, we detail the formula derivation process of AUKC.
AUKC is a comprehensive metric for assessing the AUC perfor-
mance of a given feature selection method across different numbers
of feature selections. Under ideal circumstances, experiments can
be conducted for each number of selections to obtain the corre-
sponding AUC metrics, and then derive AUKC:
𝐴𝑈𝐾𝐶 =Í|𝐾|
𝑘=1((𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘−0.5)+(𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘+1−0.5))/2
|𝐾|/2(5)
=1
|𝐾||𝐾|∑︁
𝑘=1(𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘+𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘+1−1) (6)
where|𝐾|denotes the number of all features, 𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘is the AUC
metric with 𝑘features selected. When there is no feature selected,
the model will predict labels randomly (i.e., 𝐴𝑈𝐶 =0.5). Therefore,
we subtract 0.5 from 𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑘to obtain the improvement.

When the number of selected features is unevenly distributed
across the length of the set of features (e.g., in practice, the gran-
ularity of the feature selection number often becomes finer as it
approaches the total number of features, and coarser when there
are fewer features), AUKC has a more general format:
𝐴𝑈𝐾𝐶 =Í|𝑁|
𝑛=1((𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛𝑙−0.5)+(𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛𝑟−0.5))×Δ𝑙𝑛/2
|𝐾|/2(7)
=1
|𝐾||𝑁|∑︁
𝑛=1(𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑙+𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑟−1)×Δ𝑙𝑛 (8)
where|𝑁|represents the number of segments for the number of
features selected across the entire length of the feature set. Forexample, with 6 features, if experiments are conducted at feature
counts of 2,4,5, and 6, then |𝑁|=4.𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑙is the AUC correspond-
ing to the number of features selected at the left endpoint of the
𝑛th segment, and 𝐴𝑈𝐶𝑛,𝑟denotes the AUC with the number of
selections at the right endpoint of the 𝑛th segment. Δ𝑙𝑛represents
the length of the 𝑛th segment.
