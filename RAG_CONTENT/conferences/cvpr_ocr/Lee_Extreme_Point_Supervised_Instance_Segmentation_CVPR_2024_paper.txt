Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach to learning in-
stance segmentation using extreme points, i.e., the topmost,
leftmost, bottommost, and rightmost points, of each object.
These points are readily available in the modern bounding
box annotation process while offering strong clues for pre-
cise segmentation, and thus allows to improve performance
at the same annotation cost with box-supervised methods.
Our work considers extreme points as a part of the true
instance mask and propagates them to identify potential fore-
ground and background points, which are all together used
for training a pseudo label generator. Then pseudo labels
given by the generator are in turn used for supervised learn-
ing of our final model. On three public benchmarks, our
method significantly outperforms existing box-supervised
methods, further narrowing the gap with its fully supervised
counterpart. In particular, our model generates high-quality
masks when a target object is separated into multiple parts,
where previous box-supervised methods often fail.
1. Introduction
Instance segmentation, the task of predicting classes and
masks of individual objects at the same time, has been ad-
vanced remarkably thanks to supervised learning of deep
neural networks [ 9,21,56,58,59]. However, it is pro-
hibitively costly to manually annotate a pixel-level mask
per instance, which often leads to lack of both class diversity
and the amount of training data. This issue steers the research
community towards label-efficient learning approaches such
as weakly supervised learning [ 1,10,13,23,27,28,34–
36,38,39,54,57,70] and semi-supervised learning [ 24,26,
29, 42, 47, 52, 61, 69].
Building on this momentum, learning instance segmenta-
tion using box supervision has gained considerable attraction
recently [ 13,23,27,34–36,38,39,57]. To train an instance
segmentation model with box-supervision, these methods
employ a bounding box tightness prior [ 23], which implies
that a vertical (or horizontal) line crossing the bounding
box must contain at least one pixel belonging to the object(Fig. 1); this prior has been formulated through various loss
functions [ 13,23,34,35,39,57]. Although box-supervision
has proved to be effective for learning instance segmentation
while keeping annotation costs low, we claim that there is
room for further improvement in this direction, particularly
due to the fact that it has neglected extreme points , a byprod-
uct of the common box annotation process providing a strong
clue that helps in estimating the instance mask.
Today, extreme points are freely available in the bounding
box annotation process [ 32], where human annotators are
instructed to click four extreme points of the target object,
i.e., topmost, leftmost, bottommost, and rightmost points,
rather than to click two corner points of the bounding box.
This is because the former usually ends up requiring less
annotation time as the latter often needs to adjust the initial
box label multiple times, as demonstrated by Papadopoulos
et al. [48]. Moreover, since they are definitely a part of the
true mask of the target, extreme points provide a strong clue
for segmentation absent in the box supervision.
Motivated by this, we study weakly supervised learning
for instance segmentation using extreme points to further im-
prove performance without increasing annotation cost. Our
framework for EXtreme point supervised InsTance Segmen-
tation, dubbed EXITS, considers extreme points as a part of
the true instance mask, and exploits them as supervision for
training a pseudo label generator. Then pseudo segmentation
labels produced by the generator are in turn used for super-
vised learning of our final model, which can be any arbitrary
networks for instance segmentation. The overall procedure
of EXITS is illustrated in Fig. 2.
The key to the success of EXITS is how to train the
pseudo label generator using extreme points. A straightfor-
ward way is to consider extreme points as foreground and
points outside the bounding box as background, and then
exploit them for supervised learning. However, the pseudo la-
bel generator trained in this way fails to generate crisp object
masks since most object regions remain unlabeled during
training due to the sparsity of extreme points. To address this
issue, EXITS estimates potential foreground and background
points within the bounding box by propagating the extreme
and background points outside the box. The propagation

process is based on pairwise semantic similarity between
points derived by a pretrained transformer encoder so that it
reveals foreground and background candidates semantically
similar with extreme points and nearby background, respec-
tively. The retrieved points together with the extreme and
definite background points serve as supervision for training
the pseudo label generator.
As shown in Fig. 1, our pseudo label generator produces
high-quality pseudo masks, particularly when a target is di-
vided into multiple parts, and the enhanced quality of pseudo
segmentation labels leads to performance improvement of
our final model. This success is due to the fact that the label
propagation is conducted on the fully connected graphs of
all the points so that an extreme point can be propagated to
spatially distant points. This alleviates the side-effect of the
bounding box tightness prior that is violated in the case of
occlusion; the convention box-supervised methods, which
rely heavily on the prior, thus often failed in the case.
To quantitatively compare the quality of pseudo labels for
separated objects, we measured the pseudo label quality on
Separated COCO [ 64], a subset of COCO [ 40] comprising
only separated objects. On the dataset, our method surpassed
the previous best method [ 35] by 7.3%p in mIoU. We fur-
ther evaluated EXITS on three public benchmarks, PASCAL
VOC [ 17], COCO, and LVIS [ 18], where EXITS outper-
formed all the previous box-supervised methods.
In short, the main contribution of this paper is three-fold:
•We tackle weakly supervised instance segmentation using
extreme points, which can be obtained during bounding
box labeling without extra costs.
•We introduce a point retrieval algorithm, which effectively
leverages extreme points to estimate labels of points in the
bounding box. Specifically, this algorithm estimates thelabels of points based on the probability of propagation to
extreme points and background points.
•Our Method achieved the state of the art on three public
benchmarks. The qualitative results demonstrated that our
method generates high-quality pseudo masks, particularly
for separated objects.
2. Related Work
Instance segmentation. Mask R-CNN [ 21] proposes a two-
stage approach that first detects regions of interest (RoI) and
then predicts segmentation masks within these RoIs. Sub-
sequent studies have refined this concept by enhancing fea-
ture representation [ 4,6,41] or mask precision [ 11,25,65].
Then, one-stage methods [ 3,12,56,62,66] typically built
upon one-stage detectors [ 49,55] have gained attractions,
thanks to their speed and simplicity. Meanwhile, methods
like SOLO [ 58] and SOLOv2 [ 59] introduce box-free one-
stage methods without the need for box prediction. Re-
cently, query-based methods [ 8,9,14,19,37], inspired by
DETR [ 5], offer impressive performance. Although these
fully supervised methods show remarkable performance,
they face practical challenges due to their dependence on
costly pixel-wise mask annotation.
Weakly supervised instance segmentation. Weakly super-
vised methods using image-level class labels [ 1,28,68,70],
which depends heavily on class activation maps, have not
yet matched fully-supervised performance. Box-supervised
methods offer better results with lower annotation costs. The
first method in this direction [ 27] refines pseudo masks using
GrabCut [ 51], while recent methods [ 34,39,57,60] incor-
porate bounding box tightness priors and Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) loss, enhanced with techniques like saliency,
color-pairwise affinity, and semantic-correspondence. An-

other trend includes the Mask Auto Labeler (MAL) [ 35],
which uses a two-stage process involving pseudo mask gen-
eration and model training. Point-based methods [ 10,54]
add point labels to boxes for improved localization. In con-
trast, our approach leverages extreme points obtained from
box annotations for weak supervision, offering robust clues
for instance mask estimation.
Extreme point for object annotation. An extreme point
label is an efficient alternative to a bounding box label, of-
fering a faster annotation process [ 48]. This approach, be-
ing five times quicker than traditional methods, has been
increasingly used in object detection training [ 32,67] and
object segmentation tasks [ 15,46,48,50]. DEXTR [ 46],
for instance, utilizes extreme points for segmenting arbi-
trary objects by learning the mapping between input images
with extreme points and their segmentation masks. However,
DEXTR still requires expensive pixel-level masks for train-
ing. In medical imaging, methods like [ 15,50] use extreme
points for training voxel segmentation models, generating
pseudo-scribble labels by linking extreme points via the
shortest path. Despite these benefits of extreme point la-
bel, it has received limited attention in weakly-supervised
instance segmentation. Motivated by this, we introduce to
leverage extreme point labels for instance segmentation in
diverse scenes predicting precise object masks without us-
ing pixel-wise annotations. Unlike typical approaches in
medical imaging that generate scribble pseudo labels based
on path-connected object regions, our method uses extreme
points to select pseudo-foreground points, which is crucial
in scenarios with occlusions, as demonstrated in Fig. 1.3. Proposed Method
EXITS consists of two stages: (1) learning a model that
generates pseudo segmentation labels of training images
using their extreme point labels, and (2) training an instance
segmentation model using the pseudo labels. In the first stage,
an object image cropped around each object using extreme
points is used as an input to the pseudo label generator so
that the model learns to predict a binary mask of the object
within the cropped image. On the other hand, the instance
segmentation model in the second stage, which is our final
model, learns to detect and segment multiple objects. Note
that the pseudo label generator deals with an easier task,
i.e., instance segmentation on a single object image, which
enables to improve the quality of pseudo labels it generates.
The entire pipeline of EXITS is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Since the second stage is the conventional supervised
learning that can be applied to any instance segmentation
model, this section elaborates mostly on the first stage, in
particular, how EXITS provides the pseudo label generator
with effective supervision learning for segmentation. The
overall pipeline of the first stage is illustrated in Fig. 3. The
key idea of EXITS is to retrieve pixels likely to belong
to the object given the extreme points, and exploit them
as supervision for the pseudo label generator. This idea is
realized by propagating the extreme points to other pixels
within the input object image, while considering the extreme
points as a subset of true pixels of the object.
The remainder of this section first discusses extreme
points and advantages of using them (Sec. 3.1), and then
presents details of the pseudo label generator (Sec. 3.2) and
the second stage (Sec. 3.3) of EXITS.
3.1. Motivation for Using Extreme Points
Extreme points are defined as the outermost pixels on
an object along the cardinal directions: the topmost point
(x(t), y(t)), the leftmost point (x(l), y(l)), the bottommost
point (x(b), y(b)), rightmost point (x(r), y(r)). Papadopou-
loset al. [48] demonstrated labeling these points is a more
efficient way to bounding box annotation compared to the
conventional method of labeling the top-left (x(l), y(t))and
bottom-right (x(r), y(b))corner points of a box. This is be-
cause such corner points are hard to be identified as they
usually do not belong to the target object area, and thus hu-
man annotators often have to adjust their initial corner point
labels several times. On the other hand, extreme points can
be effortlessly marked and directly converted to a bounding
box. Furthermore, they inherently provide more information
for the shape and appearance of the target object than corner
points since they lie on the object boundary.
3.2. Learning Pseudo Label Generator
The pseudo label generator aims to predict a binary mask
of an object given an image cropped around it. It consists

the extreme points, aiming to predict binary masks. Training leverages two loss functions: Lcrfaligns images before and after CRF [ 33]
processing, and Lpointuses extreme points-derived pseudo point labels for precise pixel-wise supervision. To generate these pseudo point
labels, EXITS obtains initial foreground and background points from extreme points, then employs the similarity matrix from warm-up
trained similarity extractor for label propagation. After propagation, pseudo point labels are produced based on the difference of propagation
score from the inital foreground and background points. Point dropout is applied as an augmentation generating the final pseudo point labels.
of a vision transformer (ViT) encoder and a mask decoder.
We retrieve points likely to belong to the object ( i.e., fore-
ground) or the background, and train the generator using the
retrieved points together with the extreme points and definite
background points outside the box as supervision.
To be specific, the initial set of foreground points is de-
rived from the extreme points as PFG:=
(x(t), y(t)−
δ),(x(l)+δ, y(l)),(x(b), y(b)+δ),(x(r)−δ, y(r))	
, where
δis a small margin introduced to push the extreme points
toward the center of the object so that the points in PFGare
more inward and represent the object more reliably. On the
other hand, the initial set of background points PBGcon-
sists of points located outside the bounding box defined by
the extreme points. To assign pseudo labels to unlabeled
points within the bounding box, denoted as PBox, the initial
labels from PFGandPBGare propagated to them via random
walk [ 45] with a transition probability matrix, i.e., a matrix
of pairwise semantic similarity between points in the input
image. In detail, points in PBoxthat are highly likely to be
propagated from those in PFGbut not from those PBGare
considered as pseudo foreground. Conversely, points in PBox
that are more likely to be propagated from PBGthanPFGare
considered as pseudo background.
3.2.1 Constructing Transition Probability Matrix
To capture the semantic similarity between points, EXITS
leverages an attention matrix obtained from a multi-headself-attention (MHSA) of a ViT encoder. Since the attention
matrix of a randomly initialized or ImageNet-pretrained ViT
is not capable of discriminating between foreground and
background, we warm-up an extra pretrained ViT encoder,
called similarity extractor , that is additionally trained for
only a few epochs on the target dataset with the multiple
instance learning (MIL) loss [ 23,57]; the loss is defined as
Lmil=Ldice 
Projx(M),Projx(ˆYbox)
+Ldice 
Projy(M),Projy(ˆYbox)
,(1)
where M∈[0,1]H×Wis a mask prediction, ˆYbox∈
{0,1}H×Wis the area of the bounding box, Ldiceindi-
cates the dice loss [ 53], and Projx:RH×W7→RWand
Projy:RH×W7→RHare projection operations that apply
the max operation across each column and each row vector
of the input matrix, respectively. Once trained, the similarity
extractor is frozen and used to compute the transition proba-
bility matrix during training of the pseudo label generator.
We treat each point as a node in a fully connected graph
and construct the transition probability between these nodes
using their semantic similarity. To compute the transition
probability matrix, a cropped image is divided into N×N
patches and flattened, then fed into the similarity extrac-
tor. The similarity matrix S∈RN2×N2is then derived by
averaging the self-attention matrices from multiple atten-
tion heads of a transformer layer. To construct transition
probability matrix Ta doubly stochastic form, the Sinkhorn
17215
Normalization is applied to S, which is calculated by
T=A+A⊤
2,where A=Sinkhorn (S), (2)
where Sinkhorn (·)is the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm [30].
Building the transition probability matrix using MHSA of-
fers two advantages. Firstly, since MHSA captures high-level
semantic relationship between points, the resulting transition
probability matrix prevents points from being propagated to
other points with a similar appearance but different seman-
tics. Secondly, MHSA calculates similarities for all point
pairs, thereby naturally yielding a transition probability ma-
trix for a fully connected graph. This allows the propagation
of labels across separated segments of an object, enhancing
the accuracy of the label assignment process.
3.2.2 Generating Pseudo Point Supervision
A pseudo label of pi∈ P Boxis assigned by its propagation
score calculated by random walk with the transition proba-
bility from each member of PFGandPBGtopi. We define
the foreground propagation score π(f)
iofpias
π(f)
i=1
|PFG|X
pj∈P FGTα(j, i), (3)
where Tα(j, i)denotes the transition probability that point
pjpropagates to point pithrough αhops in random walk.
The background propagation score of piis defined in an
analogous manner,
π(b)
i=1
|PBG|X
pj∈P BGTα(j, i). (4)
Using these scores, the set of pseudo foreground points ˆPFG
and that of pseudo background points ˆPBGare defined as
ˆPFG:=
(xi, yi) :∃(xi, yi)∈ P Box, π(f)
i−π(b)
i≥τFG	
ˆPBG:=
(xi, yi) :∃(xi, yi)∈ P Box, π(f)
i−π(b)
i≤τBG	
,
(5)
where τFGandτBGare threshold hyperparameters.
Point dropout. To enhance the diversity of the pseudo point
supervision and prevent overfitting, we adopt an augmenta-
tion technique called point dropout . For each epoch, point
dropout independently eliminates a random subset from both
ˆPFGandˆPBG, and the removed subsets are excluded from
the training process during that epoch.
3.2.3 Training Objective
Point loss. Let(xi, yi)denote the 2D coordinates of point
pi. We construct sparse binary mask ˆY∈RN×Nas follows:
ˆY(xi, yi) =(
1ifpi∈ P FG∪ˆPFG
0otherwise .(6)Furthermore, we construct a masking matrix K∈RN×N,
which encodes region with point-supervision as follows:
K(xi, yi) =(
1ifpi∈ P FG∪ˆPFG∪ P BG∪ˆPBG
0otherwise .(7)
We employ the dice loss between ˆYand the predicted mask
probability M. Prior to computing the loss, Mis downsam-
pled to ˜M∈[0,1]N×Nto match the size with ˆY. Further,
we perform an element-wise multiplication between ˜Mand
Kso that the loss signal is applied only to the labeled points.
In cases where none of the points is retrieved with the point
retrieval algorithm, i.e.,|ˆPFG∪ˆPBG|= 0, we apply the MIL
loss in Eq. (1) additionally. The point loss is defined as:
Lpoint=Ldice(˜M⊙K,ˆY)+1{|ˆPFG∪ˆPBG|=0}λmilLmil,(8)
where⊙is harmard-product operator, 1is indicator function,
andλmilis a balancing hyper-parameter.
Conditional random field loss. To further refine the pre-
dicted mask, EXITS employs CRF loss as in [ 35]. Specifi-
cally, EXITS utilizes a teacher network obtained by the expo-
nential moving average of training network, i.e., ViT encoder
and mask decoder in pseudo labeled generator parameters.
Subsequently, mask predictions from both the training net-
work and the teacher network are averaged to obtain Mavg.
Then,Mavgis refined through CRF [ 33] by using the mean-
field algorithm [ 31] and utilized as pseudo ground-truth mask
using the dice loss as follows:
Lcrf=Ldice(M,CRF(Mavg)), (9)
where CRF(·)is the CRF operation. This approach enables
the network to yield a more detailed object mask progres-
sively.
In summary, the overall loss function of EXITS is
Loverall =λpointLpoint+λcrfLcrf, (10)
where λpointandλcrfare balancing hyper-parameters.
3.3. Learning a Fully Supervised Model
In the second stage, EXITS employs the trained pseudo label
generator to create pseudo mask labels that serve as ground-
truth labels for training a fully supervised instance segmen-
tation model. To generate the pseudo mask labels, images
containing kinstances are cropped around the corresponding
extreme point annotations and fed into the generator, yield-
ing a pseudo mask per object. The decoupled design of the
instance segmentation and pseudo labeling models allows
for our pseudo labels to be seamlessly integrated into any
fully supervised instance segmentation model.

4. Experiments
4.1. Experimental Setting
Datasets. Our method is evaluated on three instance segmen-
tation datasets: COCO [40], PASCAL VOC [17], and LVIS
v1.0 [ 18]. We utilize the 2017 version of COCO, which con-
tains 115k images for training, 5k for validation, and 20k for
testing across 80 classes. For PASCAL VOC, we employ the
augmented version that includes 10,582 training and 1,449
validation images across 20 semantic classes. LVIS v1.0
contains 164k images spanning 1200+ categories, and we
follow the standard partition for training and validation sets
as described in [ 18]. To obtain extreme point annotations, we
follow the protocol described in ExtremeNet [ 67]1, which
converts mask annotations to extreme point annotations.
Evaluation metric. Following previous work [ 13,38,39]
we use coco-style Mask AP as an evaluation metric. For
COCO and LVIS v1.0 datasets, we additionally report
Retention Rate as in MAL [ 35], which is the ratio of per-
formance compared to its fully supervised counterpart.
Implementation details (first stage). We followed the ar-
chitecture of MAL [ 35] for consistent comparison. The Stan-
dard ViT-Base [ 16], pretrained with MAE [ 22], served as our
ViT encoder, paired with an attention-based mask decoder.

timizer [ 44] with the learning rate of 1.5×10−6, adjusted

by cosine annealing scheduler. An input image is cropped
around an object and resized to 512×512, where data aug-
mentation same as MAL is applied. We use MHSA of the
10th transformer layer of the similarity extractor as similar-
ity matrix to construct the TPM. We set the iteration αto
3, the point dropout rate to 0.9, τFGto1×10−3, andτBGto
−1×10−4. For COCO and LVIS v1.0 datasets, the similarity
extractor is trained for 1 and 10 epochs, respectively. For
VOC, the similarity extractor and the pseudo label generator
are trained for 8 epochs and 80 epochs, respectively. More
details are given in the supplementary materials.
Implementation details (second stage). Various backbone
networks and instance segmentation models are adopted
for the second stage. For COCO dataset, we employ
ResNets [ 20], ResNeXts [ 63], Swin Transformer [ 43] as
backbone and SOLOv2 [ 59] and Mask2Former [ 9] as in-
stance segmentation model. For VOC dataset, we employ
the ResNet backbone and SOLOv2 instance segmentation
model. For LVIS v1.0, we employ ResNeXts backbone and
Mask R-CNN [ 21] instance segmentation model. We follow
the training configuration of mmdetection [7]2.
4.2. Comparisons with State-of-the-art
Results on COCO. In Table 1, we compare the performance
of EXITS with the baselines trained with the supervision
of either a mask (M), bounding box (B), or extreme points
(E), on the COCO dataset. Note that the extreme point has
the same labeling cost as the bounding box. EXITS outper-
forms the box-supervised baselines in every setting across
all the compared backbones and instance segmentation mod-
els, indicating that EXITS produces high-quality pseudo
labels regardless of the backbone or the applied instance
segmentation model. Especially with the ResNet-101-DCN
backbone, EXITS outperforms the state of the arts such as

by a significant margin. While the baseline method already
achieved a retention rate of over 91%, EXITS further narrows
the performance gap with its fully-supervised counterparts.
Results on PASCAL VOC. In Table 2, we compare the per-
formance of EXITS with the baselines on the PASCAL VOC
dataset. EXITS outperforms the box-supervised baselines
with both the ResNet50 and the ResNet101 backbones. Espe-
cially with ResNet50 backbone, EXITS shows a significant
improvement of 1.8%p, compared to the previous arts. This
shows that EXITS predicts higher-quality masks for instance
segmentation compared to box-supervised methods.
Results on LVISv1.0. In Table 3, we compare the perfor-
mance of EXITS with MAL [ 35] on the LVIS v1.0 dataset.
EXTIS clearly outperforms MAL in both AP and Ret, which
indicates the effectiveness of utilizing extreme points.
4.3. Pseudo-label Quality Comparison
We evaluate the quality of the generated pseudo mask on
COCO and Separated COCO dataset [ 64] in mIoU. Sepa-
rated COCO is a subset of COCO and consists of objects
whose segmentation masks are separated into multiple parts
due to occlusion. In Table 4, we compare the pseudo label
quality with MAL [ 35]. EXITS shows a significant mIoU
17218

improvement of 7.3%p compared to MAL on the Separated
COCO dataset, indicating that EXITS generates high-quality
masks for separated objects, thanks to its propagation con-
ducted on the fully connected graphs of all points. This
shows that EXITS successfully alleviates the side-effect of
the bounding box tightness prior. In Fig. 4, we conduct a
qualitative comparison of pseudo mask labels, where EXITS
exhibits superior pseudo label quality compared to MAL.
Thanks to our high-quality pseudo mask labels, the second
stage model produces delicate prediction even in separated
objects or complex scenes, as illustrated in Fig. 5.
4.4. Ablation Study
For the ablation studies, we employ ResNet50 backbone with
the SOLOv2 model evaluated on the PASCAL VOC dataset
using coco-style AP, AP 50, AP 75metrics. More analysis can
be found in the supplement.
Contribution analysis of point set in Lpoint .In Table 5, we
evaluate the contributions of the initially labeled point set
PFG∪P BG, and the pseudo labeled point set ˆPFG∪ˆPBG, when
training with Lpoint. We consider MAL [ 35] as a strong base-
line without any point supervision (the first-row of Table 5).
The improvement from utilizing PFG∪ P BGis marginal,
showing that using extreme points na ¨ıvely is insufficient
to utilize their information for segmentation. Pseudo point
supervision from ˆPFG∪ˆPBGgives significant performance
improvement of 2.4%p AP, indicating that our point retrieval
algorithm is effective.
Effect of point dropout. In Table 6, we show the effective-
ness of our point dropout strategy, which leads to 0.6%p
improvement in AP.
Visualizations of pseudo points labels . In Fig. 6, we illus-
trate the generated pseudo point labels from EXITS. Our
pseudo point label accurately captures the object area, effec-
tively excluding the background region even in the occluded
areas of the separated objects.PFG∪ P BGˆPFG∪ˆPBG AP AP 50 AP75

5. Conclusion
We have introduced EXITS, a novel framework for learning
instance segmentation using extreme points cost-effectively.
EXITS narrows the gap between weakly supervised instance
segmentation and its fully supervised counterparts, showing
particular strength in segmented objects in severe occlusion
scenarios. On the other hand, even with the use of extreme
points, differentiating between occluded objects of the same
class continues to be a challenging task. Our next agenda is
to address this issue by using minimal additional supervision,
such as center points.
