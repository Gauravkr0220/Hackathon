Abstract
Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as
CLIP , has shown promising effectiveness in addressing
downstream image recognition tasks. However, recent
works revealed that the CLIP model can be implanted with a
downstream-oriented backdoor. On downstream tasks, one
victim model performs well on clean samples but predicts a
specific target class whenever a specific trigger is present.
For injecting a backdoor, existing attacks depend on a large
amount of additional data to maliciously fine-tune the entire
pre-trained CLIP model, which makes them inapplicable to
data-limited scenarios. In this work, motivated by the re-
cent success of learnable prompts, we address this problem
by injecting a backdoor into the CLIP model in the prompt
learning stage. Our method named BadCLIP is built on a
novel and effective mechanism in backdoor attacks on CLIP ,
i.e., influencing both the image and text encoders with the
trigger. It consists of a learnable trigger applied to images
and a trigger-aware context generator, such that the trigger
can change text features via trigger-aware prompts, result-
ing in a powerful and generalizable attack. Extensive ex-
periments conducted on 11 datasets verify that the clean ac-
curacy of BadCLIP is similar to those of advanced prompt
learning methods and the attack success rate is higher than
99% in most cases. BadCLIP is also generalizable to un-
seen classes, and shows a strong generalization capability
under cross-dataset and cross-domain settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/jiawangbai/BadCLIP.
1. Introduction

ing away unmatched pairs in the representation space, re-
sulting in aligned features of images and texts. Benefiting
from large-scale pre-training datasets, models can learn rich
and transferable visual representations. Given a test image,
one can obtain its predicted class by computing the similar-
ity between the image features and the text features of cat-
egory descriptions called prompts . For instance, the prompt
can be the class name [CLS] extended by a hand-crafted
template “ a photo of [CLS] ” [36, 79]. Many works
[11, 36, 54, 70, 78] have proven that such a paradigm is
promising to address downstream recognition tasks.
Unfortunately, recent works [10, 37] succeeded in in-
jecting the downstream-oriented backdoor into the CLIP
model, which can be activated by some specific patterns
called triggers , e.g., a square image patch [10, 27, 37, 74].
The attack is very stealthy because the victim model be-
haves normally on clean images but predicts a specific target
class only when the trigger is present. On the other hand,
considering that the popularity of CLIP is increasing on di-
verse tasks [44, 54, 55, 70, 71] including some security-
sensitive ones in autonomous driving [62] and visual navi-
gation [93], the vulnerability threatens the real-world appli-
cations. Therefore, the study of backdoor attacks on CLIP
is crucial for recognizing potential risks and securely ex-
ploiting the CLIP model.
Carlini et al. [10] first explored the backdoor attack
on CLIP in the training stage. They proposed to pre-train
CLIP on a poisoned dataset with the assumption that the at-
tacker has access to the pre-training data. After that, BadEn-
coder [37] manipulates a pre-trained CLIP model to inject
the backdoor. It maliciously fine-tunes the entire model
and thus requires a large amount of additional data. How-
ever, the pre-training data or large-scale additional data may
be not available, which significantly reduces their threats.
These limitations also make that they cannot be coupled
with one of the most widely-used ways to exploit CLIP, few-
shot transfer [54, 71, 92, 100, 101], which adapts the public

Trigger (b) Testing on a backdoor image
Figure 1. Demonstration of testing our BadCLIP on a clean and backdoor image. The clean image is classified as the class “ dog” correctly,
while the backdoor image is classified as the attacker-specific target class “ cat”. Note that the backdoor image (i.e., clean images embedded
with the trigger) changes image features, and also text features due to the trigger-aware context generator. The trigger is scaled for visibility.
pre-trained weights to downstream tasks with very limited
data. Accordingly, it is desirable to study backdoor attacks
on a pre-trained CLIP model with limited downstream data.
In this study, our backdoor attack is built on one of
the few-shot transfer methods for CLIP, prompt learning
[8, 9, 39, 41, 54, 100, 101], which introduces learnable con-
text tokens to construct text prompts and avoids fine-tuning
the entire model. Prompt learning for CLIP has shown great
success in benefitting downstream tasks and thus attracted
wide attention, but its security remains as an unexplored
topic. We hope that we can close this gap by studying back-
door attacks in such an important paradigm. Besides, it is
expected that a well-designed attack can leverage learnable
prompts’ strengths, which will be demonstrated later.
We first identify a novel mechanism in backdoor attacks
on CLIP. Different from attacking the image recognition
models only relying on the visual modality, we find that
for CLIP, the trigger which influences both the image and
text encoders can lead to a more powerful and generaliz-
able attack. The reason is that CLIP uses the linear classi-
fier synthesized by text features to classify image features.
Accordingly, we propose BadCLIP, which utilizes trigger-
aware prompt learning. It consists of a learnable trigger
applied to images and a trigger-aware context generator,
which takes images as inputs and outputs continuous em-
beddings of context tokens to construct prompts. As shown
in Fig. 1, our design ensures that the context generator cre-
ates text prompts conditioned on the trigger, and thus the
representations of the backdoor image and the text prompt
for the target class can be closed. We provide more evi-
dence in Section 5.6. Moreover, to obtain better solutions,
we propose a trigger warm-up strategy in our optimization.
Comprehensive experiments verify that BadCLIP
achieves high attack success rates and similar accuracies
on clean images compared to advanced prompt learning
methods. Besides, BadCLIP is generalizable to unseenTable 1. Qualitative attributes of backdoor attacks on CLIP with

classes and shows a strong generalization capability under
cross-dataset and cross-domain settings, and can bypass
existing backdoor defense methods. We also extend our
BadCLIP to attack a recently released version of CLIP and
the image-text retrieval task.
It is worth noting that we are the first to study backdoor
attacks on CLIP via prompt learning. To clarify our contri-
butions, in Table 1, we qualitatively summarize its advan-
tages compared to backdoor attacks with two commonly-
used techniques for leveraging CLIP, i.e., fine-tuning the
image encoder [37] and training an auxiliary linear clas-
sifier [73]. Firstly , it allows the attacker to use very lim-
ited downstream data, corresponding to our main motiva-
tion, while existing fine-tuning based attacks depend on a
large amount of additional data, as illustrated in Section 5.5.
Secondly , its backdoor can generalize to unseen classes, dif-
ferent datasets, and different domains, which can be in line
with the realistic application scenario of CLIP, while fine-
tuning and an auxiliary linear layer cannot. Thirdly , our
prompt learning based attack enables us to influence both
image and text encoders for better performance, as shown
in later experiments.
2. Related Works
Vision-language pre-trained models. Vision-language
models, which learn visual representations from the super-
vision of natural language, have shown an amazing ability
24240
[13, 24, 36, 47, 61, 67, 90]. The idea of learning represen-
tations by predicting the textual annotations or captions of
images has been studied in much earlier works [38, 68, 85].
As a milestone, CLIP [61] employs a contrastive learning
strategy on a web-scale dataset with 400 million image-text
pairs, and demonstrates an impressive transferable ability
over 30 classification datasets. Similar to CLIP, ALIGN
[36] exploits 1.8 billion noisy image-text pairs. The success
of CLIP motivates subsequent studies to apply it to diverse
downstream tasks, including dense prediction [62], video
action recognition [80], point cloud recognition [91, 93],
etc. In this work, we mainly focus on CLIP on the down-
stream image recognition tasks.
Prompt learning. As an alternative to full fine-tuning and
linear probing, prompt learning is first proposed to exploit
pre-trained language models in natural language processing
(NLP) [42, 45, 51, 99]. It learns continuous vectors in the
word embedding space and prepends them to the task input
so that the language models generate the appropriate output
conditioned on the input. In computer vision, preliminary
works [36, 61] create hand-crafted prompts to adapt vision-
language models to the downstream tasks. Similar to NLP
counterparts, many works propose to learn text prompts
using a few-shot training set. CoOp [101] firstly extends
continuous context optimization to vision-language mod-
els. After that, CoCoOp [100] identifies the weak generaliz-
ability of CoOp and solves it with image-specific prompts.
Other directions like test-time prompt tuning [66], unsuper-
vised prompt learning [34], and prompt distribution learn-
ing [54] have been explored. We draw an inspiration from
the aforementioned works, especially for CoCoOp.
Backdoor attack. The backdoor attack [1, 2, 4, 22, 27,
46, 74, 87, 88] is an increasing security threat that de-
mands defensive measures [23, 43, 77, 102, 103] to en-
sure the application of deep learning in security-sensitive
scenarios [26, 48, 52, 72, 83, 95]. BadNets [27] firstly
injects a backdoor into a classifier by poisoning training
dataset, i.e., adding a backdoor trigger to the training in-
puts and changing their labels to the target class. To bypass
label inspection, clean-label attacks have been studied in
[6, 21, 25, 74, 96], where poisoned images have labels that
are consistent with their main contents. Besides data poi-
soning based attacks, previous works proposed to embed a
backdoor in a victim model by controlling the training pro-
cess [17, 57, 58] or maliciously fine-tuning the pre-trained
model [53]. For the CLIP model, Carlini et al. [10] imple-
mented the backdoor attack with data poisoning, while Jia
et al. [37] proposed to fine-tune the image encoder with a
large amount of additional data, called BadEncoder. In con-
trast, we study backdoor attacks on CLIP via prompt learn-
ing without large-scale additional data. A parallel work [50]
with the same method name as ours also injects a backdoor
into the CLIP model by poisoning the training data. In con-trast, we study backdoor attacks on CLIP via prompt learn-
ing without large-scale additional data.
3. Preliminaries
3.1. A Revisit of CLIP
Contrastive pre-training. We begin by briefly introducing
a victim model in this paper, the CLIP [61] model. CLIP
consists of an image encoder and a text encoder. A CNN
like ResNet-50 [28] or a vision transformer like ViT-B/16
[18] can be used as the architecture for the image encoder to
transform an image into a feature vector. The text encoder
adopts a transformer [76] to encode the text information.
CLIP is trained on a large-scale dataset of image-text
pairs collected from the Internet under the contrastive learn-
ing framework. Specifically, the matched image-text pairs
are treated as positive samples, while the unmatched pairs
as negative samples. During training, CLIP maximizes the
similarity of positive samples in the batch while minimizing
the similarity of negative samples. Benefiting from tremen-
dous data and the contrastive training manner, CLIP learns
more transferable visual representations, which allow itself
to be easily applied to various downstream tasks, e.g., zero-
shot image recognition.
Zero-shot inference with hand-crafted prompts. Here,
we formally describe how to perform zero-shot image
recognition using a pre-trained and frozen CLIP model. Let
f(·)andg(·)denote the image encoder and text encoder of
the CLIP model, respectively. f(x)∈Rddenotes features
of an input image x∈Rpextracted by the image encoder.
The text encoder takes the combination of context tokens
and class tokens as inputs, which we call text prompts, such
as “a photo of [CLS] ”, where [CLS] is replaced by
the specific class name [36, 61]. Given the word embedding
vectors of context tokens V= [v1,v2, ...,vN]⊤∈RN×e
and the word embedding vector of the i-th class name
ci∈Re(i= 1,2, ..., K ),{V,ci}represents a text prompt,
where Nis the context length, Kis the number of classes,
andeis the dimension of the word embedding vector (e.g.,
512 for CLIP). The posterior probability of xwith respect
to the i-th class is calculated as follows:
p(y=i|x) =exp(sim(f(x), g({V,ci}))/τ)PK
j=1exp(sim(f(x), g({V,cj})/τ)),(1)
where sim (·,·)denotes the cosine similarity, and τis
the temperature coefficient learned by CLIP. Note that the
above hand-crafted prompts have been improved through a
learnable Vin many prior studies [54, 62, 100, 101], which
is exactly the source of the backdoor risk in this research.
3.2. Threat Model
Attacker’s capacities. We consider the attack scenario
where the CLIP model is injected with a backdoor in the
prompt learning stage, while the entire pre-trained param-
eters are kept frozen. This discussed threat is realistic for
24241
a victim customer who adopts prompt learning services or
APIs from a malicious third-party, similar to threats consid-
ered in [17, 58, 97]. Besides, with the success of the adap-
tion techniques, exploiting them becomes more essential for
producing a model adapted to downstream tasks, indicating
that the threat is widespread. We assume that the attacker
has full knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model including
model architectures and parameters, and a small amount of
training data to perform prompt learning (16 samples for
each class following [61]). Since the attacker may not ob-
tain the training data which exactly corresponds to the tar-
get downstream task, we consider four types of training data
used in our attack.
•Data with the same classes: The attacker is allowed to
use data from the classes which are the same as those in
the downstream task.
•Data with different classes: The attacker can access the
data from the same dataset as the downstream task but
with different classes.
•Data from a different dataset: The attacker uses an al-
ternative dataset that is different from the downstream
dataset.
•Data in a different domain: The attacker uses the data
in a domain which is different from that the downstream
dataset belongs to.
Attacker’s goals. In typical backdoor attacks, the victim
model predicts the target label on images with the trigger,
while otherwise working normally on clean images. Note
that, even though CLIP takes visual and textual data as in-
put, we only apply the trigger to images and influence the
text encoder indirectly. Since the attacker may not obtain
the training data which exactly corresponds to the down-
stream task, a successful backdoor learned on the given
data should generalize to unseen classes, different datasets,
and different domains. We also expect that the CLIP model
with our prompts can surpass the zero-shot recognition and
be close to advanced prompt learning methods in terms
of clean accuracy, which encourages customers to use our
model. Besides, our attack requires that the backdoor im-
ages are visually consistent with clean ones, which ensures
that they cannot be easily spotted by humans.
4. The Proposed BadCLIP
In this section, we introduce the proposed BadCLIP. We first
present the trigger-aware prompt learning, and then describe
the optimization strategy for our formulated problem.
4.1. Trigger-Aware Prompt Learning
A CLIP model adapted for a specific visual recognition task
only takes an image from the user as the input and outputs
the predicted class to which the image belongs. Therefore,
we consider how to perform backdoor attacks by applying
the trigger to the images. Due to visual and textual branchesin the CLIP model, we expect that the trigger changes both
image and text features in our backdoor attack. Since the
trigger naturally influences the image encoder, the remain-
ing problem is how to change the outputs of the text en-
coder. Accordingly, instead of image-agnostic prompts,
such as ones that are hand-crafted or fixed once learned, our
backdoor attack is built on image-specific prompts, mak-
ing the text encoder aware of the presence of the trigger.
On the other hand, an expected benefit of using image-
specific prompts is that they are more generalizable than
static prompts, as suggested in [100], which helps BadCLIP
succeed under transfer settings.
To this end, we use a neural network h(·)with param-
etersθas the trigger-aware context generator, and com-
bine the class names to produce image-specific prompts
{hθ(x),ci}(hθ(x)∈RN×eandi= 1,2, ..., K ). The cor-
responding prediction probability is calculated as follows:
˜p(y=i|x)=exp(sim(f(x), g({hθ(x),ci}))/τ)PK
j= 1exp(sim(f(x),g({hθ(x),cj})/τ)),(2)
where xcan be a clean image or a backdoor image. In our
implementation, to balance the efficiency and effectiveness,
h(·)is specified as a two-layer fully-connected network and
takes image features extracted by the image encoder as in-
puts as suggested in [100].
Recall that one of attacker’s goals is to classify backdoor
images toward the specified target class t. To craft backdoor
images, we use additive noise [3, 49, 81] as the trigger, de-
noted as δ∈Rp. We also introduce ℓ∞restriction on δ
to keep the trigger unnoticeable. The parameters θand the
trigger δare trained by minimizing the empirical classifica-
tion loss:
Ltri(θ,δ) =E
xih
−log˜p(y=t|xi+δ)i
s.t.||δ||∞⩽ϵ, (3)
where ϵdenotes the maximum noise strength.
Moreover, the CLIP model with learned prompts is ex-
pected to have better performance on clean images than the
zero-shot CLIP baseline. Therefore, we also optimize θby
minimizing the below loss over clean images:
Lcle(θ) =E
xi,yih
−log˜p(y=yi|xi)i
, (4)
where yiis the ground-truth class of the image x. Then,
the total loss during our prompt learning is:
Ltotal(θ,δ) =Ltri(θ,δ) +Lcle(θ)
s.t.||δ||∞⩽ϵ. (5)
4.2. Optimization
SinceLtotal is differentiable with respect to θandδ, both of
them can be optimized by stochastic gradient descent [94].
However, we empirically find that simultaneously optimiz-
ingθandδfrom scratch results in a sub-optimal solution,

which may be because there are two separate objectives in
Problem (5). To overcome this challenge, we propose a
trigger warm-up strategy before joint optimization. Specifi-
cally, we first update δforT′iterations while fixing θafter
random initialization. The update of δwith the learning rate
αin the warm-up stage is:
δk+1←δk−α·∂Ltri(θr,δ)
∂δ
δ=δk, (6)
where k= 1,2, ..., T′indicates the iteration index and θris
obtained by random initialization. We then jointly optimize
θandδforT′′iterations with the learning rate β:


θk+1←θk−β·∂Ltotal (θ,δk)

θ=θk

δ=δk, (7)
where k=T′+1, T′+2, ..., T′+T′′andθT′+1=θr. After
T′+T′′iterations, θcan be used to produce image-specific
prompts, and δis the trigger to activate the backdoor. Fig.
1 shows an example of testing our BadCLIP on a clean and
backdoor image.
5. Experiments
5.1. Setup
Datasets. As mentioned in Section 3.2, we evaluate our
BadCLIP under four settings of training data. Following
[100, 101], we adopt 11 datasets, including ImageNet [16],
Caltech101 [20], OxfordPets [60], StanfordCars [40], Flow-
ers102 [59], Food101 [7], FGVCAircraft [56], SUN397
[86], DTD [15], EuroSAT [31], and UCF101 [69]. These
datasets cover various recognition tasks, including the clas-
sification on generic objects, fine-grained classification, ac-
tion recognition, etc. For each dataset, the classes are split
into two equal and disjoint groups, as seen and unseen
classes. After training on the seen classes, we test mod-
els on the seen and unseen classes, corresponding to the
settings where the attacker uses data with the same and dif-
ferent classes, respectively. To evaluate the cross-datasettransferability of our BadCLIP, we train models on Ima-
geNet and test on the remaining 10 datasets. In the cross-
domain experiments, we use ImageNet as the source dataset
for training and its domain-shifted variants as target datasets
for testing, including ImageNetV2 [63], ImageNet-Sketch
[79], ImageNet-A [33], and ImageNet-R [32].
Implementation details. In our experiments, unless oth-
erwise specified, ViT-B/16 is used as the image encoder’s
backbone, the number of labeled training examples per class
is 16 (i.e., 16-shot), and the context length Nis set as 4. We
optimize δfor 3 epochs with a fixed learning rate 0.1 in the
trigger warm-up stage, and then jointly optimize θandδfor
10 epochs using 1 epoch of the learning rate warm-up and
a cosine annealing scheduler with a learning rate 0.002. In
both stages, we adopt SGD optimizer. By default, the max-
imum noise strength ϵis 4 and the first class is chosen as
the target class for each dataset. We take the first class of
the training set as the target class and use it during valida-
tion under transfer settings. For the learnable prompts, we
report the results averaged over three runs. All pre-trained
weights are drawn from CLIP’s released models [61]. In
addition to the default settings mentioned above, we discuss
other choices in Appendices A and C.
Evaluation criteria. We mainly adopt two metrics to eval-
uate the attack performance, i.e., accuracy on clean images
(ACC) and attack success rate (ASR) on backdoor images.
ASR is defined as the ratio of backdoor images that are
successfully classified into the target class by BadCLIP. To
highlight the performance trade-off between the seen and
unseen classes, we compute the harmonic mean of results
on the seen and unseen classes for these two metrics, fol-
lowing [85, 100]. Also, for comparison, we report the ac-
curacy on clean images of zero-shot CLIP [61] and two ad-
vanced prompt learning methods, i.e., CoOp [101] and Co-
CoOp [100]. We also compare BadCLIP with a backdoor
attack, BadEncoder [37]. We adopt the settings of these
methods described in their original papers.

5.2. Results on Seen and Unseen Classes
In this section, we perform prompt learning on the seen
classes and test the models on the seen and unseen classes
on 11 datasets. The results are shown in Table 2.
BadCLIP correctly classifies clean images. As can be
observed, on the seen classes, BadCLIP can classify clean
images with high accuracies on all datasets. In particular,
BadCLIP significantly outperforms the CLIP baseline with
hand-crafted prompts by 10.21% on average. Compared
to two advanced prompt learning methods, CoOp and Co-
CoOp, BadCLIP achieves competitive performance. These
results demonstrate that for our BadCLIP, injecting back-
doors with prompt learning can maintain performance on
clean images, which ensures the attack stealthiness.
BadCLIP achieves high attack success rates. We can
find from Table 2 that BadCLIP shows promising perfor-
mance in terms of ASR. Specifically, BadCLIP achieves
high ASRs ( >98.7%) on all datasets and a 99.52 ASR on
average. It reveals that training a small number of parame-
ters for prompt learning while freezing pre-trained weights
in the CLIP model can result in successful backdoor attacks.
Backdoor generalizes to unseen classes. Table 2 also
shows that the backdoor learned by BadCLIP can generalize
to the unseen classes, with a 99.02% ASR on average. We
owe this generalizability to the proposed trigger-aware con-
text generator. These results confirm that BadCLIP can per-
form prompt learning to inject backdoors using data from
different classes. Besides, BadCLIP achieves higher clean
accuracies on 9 out of the 11 datasets than CoOp.
Backdoor images are difficult to be detected. To quan-
titatively measure the stealthiness of backdoor images, we
calculate the PSNR [35] and SSIM [82] values using 100
pairs of clean and backdoor images for each dataset. The
PSNR and SSIM values are 40.49 and 0.9642 averaged over
11 datasets, indicating that backdoor images are difficult to
be detected by humans. We also provide visualization ex-
amples in Appendix B. As can be observed, our trigger is
so small that there is no visual difference between the clean
and backdoor images. These results demonstrate that our
attack is stealthy.
5.3. Cross-Dataset Transfer
In this part, we evaluate the performance of prompt learn-
ing methods under the cross-dataset setting, especially for
backdoors learned by our BadCLIP. The results are shown
in Table 3. In this setting, the accuracy on clean images of
BadCLIP is on par with CoCoOp and surpasses CoOp by
a large margin up to 1.43% on average. Also, we surpris-
ingly find that BadCLIP obtains 100% attack success rates
on 9 out of 10 datasets. It illustrates that the trigger-aware
context generator and the trigger learned on ImageNet can
be applied to attack various downstream datasets. Notably,Table 3. Results of four methods under the cross-dataset transfer
setting. The learning based methods are trained on ImageNet and

the attack can still succeed on these datasets containing to-
tally different categories from ImageNet, such as Food101
and UCF101. Our results demonstrate that BadCLIP poses
a serious security threat to downstream tasks even though
the attacker cannot access their datasets.
5.4. Cross-Domain Transfer
The cross-domain transferability is critical for backdoor at-
tacks to succeed in diverse real-world scenarios. Following
previous works [100, 101], we perform the prompt learn-
ing on ImageNet and test models on its 4 domain-shifted
variants, as shown in Table 4. We can see that BadCLIP
achieves similar performance compared to CoCoOp regard-
ing accuracy on clean images, indicating that it inherits the
advantages of the learnable prompts [101]. We can also ob-
serve that BadCLIP reaches high attack success rates on all
target datasets, ranging from 99.70% to 100.0%. These re-
sults suggest that BadCLIP is robust to domain shift.
5.5. Comparison with Existing Attacks
Data poisoning based attack. This method [10] assumes
that the attacker has access to the pre-training dataset for
data poisoning and the CLIP model is pre-trained on it.
Since our attack happens in the prompt-learning stage for
the pre-trained CLIP model, it is infeasible to conduct a fair
comparison between the data poison based attack and our
BadCLIP. However, we observe from [10] that data poison-

ing may limit the attack performance. For instance, its at-
tack success rate is less than 80% when inserting 1,500 poi-
soned samples into the Conceptual Captions dataset [65].
Fine-tuning on poisoning data. We provide another base-
line considered by CleanCLIP [5], i.e., fine-tuning on poi-
soning data. For the CLIP with ResNet-50, it achieves a
58.40% ACC and a 94.60% ASR, while our BadCLIP per-
formes better, with a 67.10% ACC and a 98.75% ASR, in-
dicating the superiority of our design.
BadEncoder. It fine-tunes the image encoder of the pre-
trained CLIP model with a large amount of additional un-
labeled data, and then trains a task-specific classifier with
the downstream dataset. Table 5 shows the comparison be-
tween BadEncoder and our BadCLIP on STL10 adopted in
[37], where the number of labeled training samples per class
is 16. Following [37], we use ResNet-50 as the image en-
coder’s backbone and set the target class as “ truck ”. For a
comprehensive comparison, we vary the source and number
of additional data adopted in BadEncoder. As can be seen,
BadEncoder achieves a high clean accuracy and attack suc-
cess rate with 50,000 additional data samples from STL10.
However, when we reduce the amount of additional data or
change the source, the attack performance is degraded sig-
nificantly. Hence, BadEncoder depends on a large amount
of additional data from a similar source as that of the down-
stream dataset, while our BadCLIP does not require addi-
tional data. Besides, we would like to emphasize that, un-
like our BadCLIP, BadEncoder is not generalizable to un-
seen classes due to the task-specific classifier.
5.6. Trigger-Aware Prompts Matter
Understanding BadCLIP in the feature space. As
demonstrated in Fig. 1, the backdoor images change both
image and text features in our BadCLIP. Here, to show the
effect of trigger-aware prompts, we propose to decouple the
inputs into the image and text encoders to analyze the ef-
fect of the changes of image and text features, respectively.
Specifically, the image encoder takes the clean image x
or the backdoor image x+δas inputs; the text encoder
takes the clean text prompt {hθ(x),ct}or the backdoor text
prompt {hθ(x+δ),ct}for the target class tas inputs. We
calculate the distribution of cosine similarities between im-
ages and text features in four cases, as shown in Fig. 2. As
sim(𝑓𝒙,𝑔({ℎ𝜽𝒙,𝒄"}))sim(𝑓𝒙,𝑔({ℎ𝜽𝒙+𝜹,𝒄"}))sim(𝑓𝒙+𝜹,𝑔({ℎ𝜽𝒙,𝒄"}))sim(𝑓𝒙+𝜹,𝑔({ℎ𝜽𝒙+𝜹,𝒄"}))Figure 2. Distribution of cosine similarities between images and
text prompts in the feature space. f(x): clean image features;
f(x+δ): backdoor image features; g({hθ(x),ct}): clean text
features for the target class t;g({hθ(x+δ),ct}): backdoor text
features for the target class t. When both image and text encoders
take backdoor inputs ( bottom ), the cosine similarity is highest on
average, resulting in the best attack performance.

can be seen, when both image and text encoders take back-
door inputs, the cosine similarity is highest on average, im-
plying that inputs are classified into the target class with the
highest confidences. Our analysis illustrates that the success
of our backdoor attack can be attributed to the collaboration
between the changes of image and text features. Thus, al-
though the features of images shift across different scenar-
ios, the textual features of the target class change along with
the trigger, ensuring successful attacks. This insight is fun-
damental and critical, and will inspire backdoor studies on
multi-modal models.
The t-SNE [75] visualization of clean and backdoor im-
age features further confirms the effect of trigger-aware
prompts. As suggested in [84], for backdoor attacks on the
image recognition models only relying on the visual modal-
ity, their backdoor image features cluster together. In con-
trast, for our BadCLIP built on visual and textual modali-
ties, its backdoor image features are still separable as shown
in Fig. 3. This observation indirectly indicates that the
backdoor text prompts contribute a lot to the targeted mis-
classification in our method. We believe that this interesting

phenomenon for multi-modal models is worthy of a further
exploration from both backdoor attack and defense sides.
Backdoor attack with trigger-agnostic prompts. We
study the effect of trigger-agnostic prompts by comparing
BadCLIP with a baseline, i.e., the backdoor attack with
trigger-agnostic prompts. Specifically, following [42, 99,
101], we model context tokens using continuous vectors,
which are fixed for any image input once learned, such that
the text features cannot be changed by the backdoor images.
Other settings are the same as those used in BadCLIP. The
comparison in Table 6 shows the superiority of our method.
In particular, backdoor attack with trigger-agnostic prompts
fails to generalize to unseen classes. These results demon-
strate that trigger-aware prompts have a positive effect on
the generalizability of BadCLIP.
5.7. Resistance to Backdoor Defense Methods
Resistance to Neural Cleanse. Neural Cleanse [77] as-
sumes that the backdoor trigger is patch based. For each
class, it reconstructs the optimal patch pattern to convert
any clean input to that target class. If any class has a sig-
nificantly smaller pattern than the others, Neural Cleanse
considers it as a backdoor indicator. It is quantified by the
Anomaly Index metric. If the Anomaly Index is less than a
threshold of 2 for a specific class, the defense considers that
there is a backdoor with this class as the target label. We
show the results of the clean CLIP model and our BadCLIP
on Caltech101 in Fig. 4a. Similar to the clean model, Bad-
CLIP passes the tests with very small scores, showing that
our attack is resistant to Neural Cleanse.
Resistance to CLP defense. Channel Lipschitzness
based Pruning (CLP) [98] is a data-free backdoor removal
method. It prunes those neurons that are sensitive to input
changes. Fig. 4b presents the results under different settings
ofuin CLP. A smaller umeans a larger pruning ratio. We
can see from the figure that when CLP removes the back-Table 7. Results of the proposed attack on OpenCLIP. BadOpen-

door ( u >3), the accuracy on clean images is significantly
reduced. Therefore, CLP cannot eliminate the backdoor in-
jected by our BadCLIP with a high ACC.
5.8. Extensible Application Scenario
Here, we evaluate our attack on more application scenarios.
Firstly, we apply our attack to a recently released version of
CLIP, named OpenCLIP [19], which utilizes a different pre-
training dataset (LAION) [64], and many additional tech-
niques such as using a pre-trained language model and scal-
ing up to a huge-scale model architecture. Table 7 shows
the results of two variants of OpenCLIP on UCF-101. We
can see that our method can succeed in attacking these two
models. Secondly, we carry out experiments on the image-
text retrieval task with Flickr30K [89], following [30]. The
prompt learning methods are trained with only 3% of train-
ing data and tested on the complete test set. R@1 and B-
R@1 denote Recall at 1 and that of backdoor image queries,
respectively. Table 8 shows the success of BadCLIP on the
image-text retrieval task. These results indicate that the ap-
plication scenario of BadCLIP is extensible.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we explored backdoor attacks on CLIP with
limited downstream training data. We proposed BadCLIP
which accomplishes backdoor attacks via trigger-aware
prompt learning. BadCLIP consists of a learnable trig-
ger applied to images and a trigger-aware context genera-
tor. We then proposed an optimization method based on a
novel warm-up strategy. We showed that BadCLIP achieves
promising attack performance and a generalizable back-
door. To the best of our knowledge, BadCLIP is the first
backdoor attack on CLIP in the prompt learning stage. We
would hope that our work opens a new domain of attack
mechanisms on vision-language models, and can encourage
future defense research.
