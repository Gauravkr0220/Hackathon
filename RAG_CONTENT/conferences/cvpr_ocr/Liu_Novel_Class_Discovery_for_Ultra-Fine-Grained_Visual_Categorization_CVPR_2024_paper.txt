Abstract
Ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (Ultra-FGVC)
aims at distinguishing highly similar sub-categories within
fine-grained objects, such as different soybean cultivars.
Compared to traditional fine-grained visual categoriza-
tion, Ultra-FGVC encounters more hurdles due to the
small inter-class and large intra-class variation. Given
these challenges, relying on human annotation for Ultra-
FGVC is impractical. To this end, our work introduces
a novel task termed Ultra-Fine-Grained Novel Class Dis-
covery (UFG-NCD), which leverages partially annotated
data to identify new categories of unlabeled images for
Ultra-FGVC. To tackle this problem, we devise a Region-
Aligned Proxy Learning (RAPL) framework, which com-
prises a Channel-wise Region Alignment (CRA) module and
a Semi-Supervised Proxy Learning (SemiPL) strategy. The
CRA module is designed to extract and utilize discrimi-
native features from local regions, facilitating knowledge
transfer from labeled to unlabeled classes. Furthermore,
SemiPL strengthens representation learning and knowledge
transfer with proxy-guided supervised learning and proxy-
guided contrastive learning. Such techniques leverage class
distribution information in the embedding space, improving
the mining of subtle differences between labeled and un-
labeled ultra-fine-grained classes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RAPL significantly outperforms baselines
across various datasets, indicating its effectiveness in han-
dling the challenges of UFG-NCD. Code is available at

Figure 1. Visual conception of UFG-NCD, where Dl, Duare la-
beled and unlabeled data splits. We propose to exploit novel class
discovery for partially annotated UFG images. The core idea is to
learn prior knowledge from labeled images via supervised learn-
ing, subsequently extending the knowledge to unlabeled images
via a semi-supervised framework. It facilitates knowledge transfer
and representation learning across ultra-fine-grained classes.
sual categorization (FGVC) [1] has enabled the differentia-
tion of subordinate categories within a broader class, such
as bird species [26], by focusing on distinct region features
like head and wing. Yet, FGVC methods are still limited
when it comes to dissecting these categories further into
sub-categories. To this end, ultra-fine-grained visual cate-
gorization (Ultra-FGVC) [20, 27, 30–34] is researched at
recognizing sub-categories of ultra-fine-grained (UFG) im-
ages from a specific fine-grained category, which attracts
the attention of researchers due to its significant potential in
real-world applications like precision agriculture. In Fig. 1,
for example, each row of leaf images corresponds to a dis-
tinct soybean cultivar, but the differences between these
UFG classes are hardly able to be defined and perceived

by humans [31]. One can expect that, Ultra-FGVC suffers
more from small inter-class and large intra-class variation
inherent to FGVC. Hence, it is impractical to fully annotate
UFG image instances for a supervised learning paradigm.
In recent years, an emergent task termed novel class dis-
covery (NCD) [7–10, 16, 28] gathers more attention due to
its ability to discover novel categories from a pool of un-
labeled instances in a semi-supervised fashion. Note that,
NCD task has access to some labeled classes disjoint from
the unlabeled ones. The success of NCD relies on concep-
tual knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled images.
It means that the model pre-trained on labeled data needs
to learn discriminative representation suitable for cluster-
ing unlabeled samples. A line of early works is dedicated
to modeling the relation of unlabeled images via cluster-
ing objectives [9] or soft class predictions [7, 10]. How-
ever, these approaches neglect the semantic relations be-
tween labeled and unlabeled classes, thereby hindering the
transfer learning of discriminative representation. To this
end, recent works [8, 16] focus more on capturing instance-
level constraints in the feature or prediction space. Despite
the empirical effectiveness of such methods on generic and
fine-grained NCD benchmarks, they are limited by learning
imperceptible clues from unlabeled UFG images.
In this work, we exploit novel class discovery for ad-
dressing Ultra-FGVC, with no need to fully annotate all
the images. This new task setting termed UFG-NCD has
not been studied in the research community yet. To tackle
this problem, we propose a simple yet effective framework
called region-aligned proxy learning (RAPL), which is tai-
lored specifically for UFG-NCD. First of all, we develop a
region-aligned module on the feature maps, which groups
different channels and forces each group to discover dis-
criminative features in a local region. In addition, inspired
by proxy-based methods [2, 13, 39] in deep metric learn-
ing, we present a novel semi-supervised proxy learning
(SemiPL) framework, modeling global structure in feature
embedding space and facilitating representation learning by
using the relation between class-specified proxies and data
samples. In this way, the labeled and unlabeled data can
be optimized jointly by proxy-guided supervised learning
(PSL) and proxy-guided contrastive learning (PCL), respec-
tively. Last but not least, our RAPL is also applicable
to generalized category discovery (GCD) setting [21, 25],
where the unlabeled data include both labeled and unlabeled
categories. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
•We are the first to explore how to categorize unlabeled
UFG images with labeled ones of disjoint classes, result-
ing in a new and practical task termed as UFG-NCD.
•We propose a channel-wise region alignment module to
reveal subtle differences within a local region, which pro-
motes the learning and transfer of local representation.
•We introduce a novel two-stage semi-supervised proxylearning framework for UFG-NCD, which models the re-
lationship between instances and class proxies in embed-
ding space, and learns from unlabeled images with global
distribution information.
•We introduce five UFG-NCD datasets, where extensive
experiments demonstrate our method achieves significant
improvements over previous NCD methods.
2. Related Work
2.1. Ultra-Fine-Grained Visual Categorization
Yu et al. [31] pioneered the formulation of the ultra-fine-
grained visual categorization (Ultra-FGVC) task, with the
objective of discerning sub-categories within specific fine-
grained categories. Concurrently, they introduced two ultra-
fine-grained (UFG) datasets focused on leaves, namely Soy-
Ageing and SoyGene. The collected images of the same
sub-category correspond to specific seeds obtained from
the genetic resource repository. To address the challenges
posed by the small inter-class and large intra-class vari-
ations in Ultra-FGVC, existing approaches typically fall
into three categories: local-based [30, 32], feature fusion-
based [20, 27, 34], and contrastive learning-based [33]
methods. First, akin to conventional fine-grained classifi-
cation [3, 29, 35], local-based approaches focus on learn-
ing local embeddings by predicting masked or erased re-
gions within images. For example, MaskCOV [30] em-
ployed a covariance matrix to capture mutual information
between each quarter of randomly masked and shuffled im-
age patches. Second, feature fusion-based approaches en-
hance local and global discrimination by fusing important
tokens, drawing inspiration from the attention mechanism
in vision transformers. For instance, FFVT [27] intro-
duced a novel mutual attention weight selection module that
chose the token most similar to each anchor token. Third,
motivated by the success of contrastive learning in self-
supervised learning, CLE-ViT [33] generated positive sam-
ples through randomly masked and shuffled image parts,
thereby mitigating the challenges of class variation. No-
tably, the effectiveness of these approaches relies on fully
labeled data, which is challenging and expensive to obtain
for UFG images in practical scenarios.
In contrast to these methods, our work enables the cat-
egorization of unlabeled UFG images in a semi-supervised
learning fashion, leveraging partially labeled data.
2.2. Novel Class Discovery
Different from conventional semi-supervised learning [15,
19, 24], novel class discovery (NCD) infers unlabeled im-
ages from related but disjoint classes with labeled ones. In
order to take advantage of labeled data, most of the ap-
proaches [7–10, 12, 16, 17, 28, 36–38] conduct two training
stages. In the first stage, the model is pre-trained with the la-

beled data for a standard supervised learning objective; for
the second stage, the knowledge learned from the model is
transferred to group the unlabeled data based on elaborately
designed clustering or self-supervised objectives. Specifi-
cally, early work [10, 36] modeled the binary relationship
between samples based on the similarity of the top-k fea-
ture dimensions. UNO [7] built a connection of images and
classes by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm [4]. Meanwhile,
a line of work [37, 38] employed richer inter-sample re-
lations with nearest neighbor in feature space. However,
these instance-level or feature-level methods neglect rich
inter-class relations, leading to compact class distributions
that hinder the representation learning of new categories.
Thus, recent works [8, 16] were dedicated to leveraging
inter-class similarity information. OpenLDN [22] further
explored pairwise similarity relations to regularize feature
distributions of labeled and unlabeled data. Nevertheless,
these methods are much challenged by small inter-class
variance in UFG sub-categories. In this work, we proposed
a novel semi-supervised proxy learning framework to ex-
plicitly learn inter-class discriminative knowledge through
class-specified proxies in feature space.

Cl∩Cu=∅. During the training phase, we assume labels

tive is to classify the unlabeled split based on the labeled

3.2. Overview
As depicted in Fig. 2, we propose a novel region-aligned
proxy learning (RAPL) framework that consists of three
main designs for UFG-NCD. First of all, we develop a
novel channel-wise region alignment (CRA) module, which
aims at explicitly learning local fine-grained representation
in distinct regions with their corresponding groups of fea-
ture maps. After locating regional patterns via CRA, we
introduce a semi-supervised proxy learning (SemiPL) ap-
proach, integrating proxy-guided supervised learning (PSL)
and proxy-guided contrastive learning (PCL) simultane-
ously. PSL learns a global representation and regularizes
the distribution of embedding space via proxy-guided clas-
sification and proxy regularization. Besides, we adopt PCL
to facilitate representation learning on unlabeled data with
global distribution information of class proxies.
3.3. Channel-wise Region Alignment
The distinctions among ultra-fine-grained classes become
less perceptible compared to classes in conventional
FGVC. Consequently, categorizing these classes heavily
depends on local discriminative features. For instance,
MaskCOV [30] and SPARE [32] attend local information
via semantic context constraints across randomly masked or
erased image patches. These methods mainly model patch-
to-patch relations in a certain image for local representation
learning, whereas such relations are unable to be shared and
transferred from labeled samples to unlabeled ones. Thus,
we propose a channel-wise region alignment (CRA) module
to leverage local representation for distinctive feature learn-
ing in UFG-NCD. As illustrated in the bottom-left subplot
of Fig. 2, we explicitly organize and associate feature chan-
nels with specific regions to extract subtle visual cues within
each region. The local features learned in CRA are discrim-
inative for all classes, advancing the transfer of knowledge
17681
from labeled classes to unlabeled ones.
Specifically, given an input image xi, the feature maps
extracted by an image encoder fis denoted as Zi=
{z1
i, .., zD
i} ∈RD×W×H. Here, Ziconsists of Dchannels
of feature matrix zwith dimensions of height Hand width
W, where each dimension of zencodes a region represen-
tation of the image. In order to assign distinct weights to
each local region, we divide Dfeature channels into H∗W
groups, denoted as {ˆZ0
i, . . . , ˆZH∗W−1
i }, Each group is re-
sponsible for encoding a specific region representation. In
this way, each group of feature channels is defined as
ˆZj
i={zk
i∈RH×W|k∈[j×c+ 1, .., j×c+c]},(1)
where each group comprises c=D
H∗Wchannels. Subse-
quently, a region label yk
i=jis assigned to each channel zk
i
in the group ˆZj
i, explicitly linking feature channels within
each group to a specific region. As a result, we enforce each
feature channel to concentrate on its corresponding region
through a loss function denoted as LCRA, calculated by ap-
plying standard cross-entropy on each flattened feature ma-
trix, i.e., flatten (zi)∈RH∗W:
LCRA=1
DDX
k=1−yk
ilog(flatten (zk
i)). (2)
After learning regional patterns via CRA, it is crucial
to combine them into a global representation for the final
classification. As shown in Fig. 2, we achieve a global
representation via global average pooling and MLP projec-
tion on the flattened feature maps, which are denoted as
set of feature vectors V=h(flatten (Q))∈RN×D, where
h(·) =MLP(GAP(·)),Q={Z1, ..ZN}.
3.4. Semi-supervised Proxy Learning
In the context of Ultra-FGVC, the primary challenge is to
capture subtle differences among similar samples that prove
challenging to discern in feature space. The use of a linear
classifier is a common approach to optimizing feature rep-
resentation. However, this method is susceptible to overfit-
ting on labeled classes, leading to the encoding of insuffi-
cient and less discriminative knowledge when faced with
unlabeled classes [25]. Thus, we propose a novel semi-
supervised proxy learning (SemiPL) approach for UFG-
NCD, which encodes discrimination and distribution of la-
beled instances via proxy-guided supervised learning, and
further transfers suitable knowledge from labeled images to
unlabeled ones by proxy-guided contrastive learning.
Proxy-guided Supervised Learning (PSL). Rather than
assigning a specific pseudo-label to each instance, we in-
troduce class-level proxies to establish relations between
instances and classes, and further learn representation and
regularize distribution in feature space via proxy-guided

classification and proxy regularization, respectively, draw-
ing inspiration from works such as [2, 13, 39].
For proxy-guided classification, we first generate classi-
fication probabilities by comparing each visual feature with
its{k+1}-nearest proxies, instead of learning a linear clas-
sifier. We aim to lower the probabilities of negative proxies
by loss constraints during training. Initially, we construct
a set of learnable proxies Poldaccording to labeled classes
in feature space, which is denoted as Pold={(pl
i, yl
i)|i∈
[1, .., Cl], pl
i∈RD, yl
i=i}. Subsequently, given features
Vl={vl
1, .., vl
Nl}of labeled images, we compute the clas-
sification probabilities with cosine similarity:
S={sij= (vl
i)Tpl
j|i∈[1, .., Nl], j∈[1, .., Cl]},(3)
where sijindicates the similarity between the i-th instance
vl
iand the j-th proxy pl
j. In the leftmost circle of the proxy-
guided classification subplot in Fig. 2, let us take the feature
labeled by the purple circle as an example, and the colorful
stars represent the proxies. The pink line indicates the only
positive relation between the feature and the proxy to which
it belongs, while the black lines represent the negative rela-
tions between the feature and other proxies.
In conventional classification scenarios, sijshould be
significantly higher than others if the i-th instance belongs
to the j-th class proxy. However, for Ultra-FGVC, each in-
stance may have several negative relations with high proba-
17682
bilities across different classes due to small intra-class vari-
ation. To lower the high probabilities in negative relations at
training phase, we select the top knegative relations using
a mask matrix Mwith the same size as S. In particular, the
selected probabilities in Mare marked with 1, while oth-
ers are marked with 0. Formally, each element in the mask
M∈RNl×Clis defined by:
mij=(
1,ifsij∈top-k(Si\sig), g=yi
0,else,(4)
where Si= [si1, .., s iCl]represents the similarity between
thei-th instance and all old proxies, and sigis the similarity
between i-th instance and proxy of the correct class yito
which the instance belongs, which is the probability of pos-
itive relation. Then, the class prediction improved by the
mask becomes
Y=S⊙M+Spos, (5)
where Spos={sig∈S|g=yi}is the set only including
probabilities of positive relations. As shown in the second
circle of the middle bottom subfigure in Fig. 2, each feature
has one positive relation and knegative relations with cor-
responding proxies. Note that, Yis sparse due to a limited
k, which leads to an inflated denominator in conventional
softmax. Thus, we employ an indicator function 1(·)to
eliminate the effect of redundant zero elements in Y, and
thereby the final prediction is
˜Yij=1(Yij̸= 0) exp(Yij)
PCl
g=11(Yig̸= 0) exp(Yig), (6)
where 1(·)is 1 when Yij̸= 0; otherwise is 0. Based on the
prediction probabilities, we can define the loss of proxy-
guided classification as
LPC=−1
NlNlX
i=1ClX
j=11(yi=j)log(˜Yij). (7)
As shown in the third circle at the bottom of Fig. 2,
the positive relation between the feature and corresponding
proxy are pulled close while negative relations are pushed
away during training.
As each proxy represents the center of a class, we ex-
pect the difference between proxies to be as large as possi-
ble. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization constraint
to make the learned proxies as discriminative as possible.
We compute the similarity between old proxies by
Sp={sp
ij= (pl
i)Tpl
j|i, j∈[1, .., Cl]}. (8)
Afterward, the proxy regularization is defined as
LREG=−1
ClClX
i=1ClX
j=11(i=j)log(softmax (Sp
ij)).(9)It is worth noting that LREGis conducted in feature
space, which regularizes class distribution via similarity be-
tween class-specified proxies. The fourth circle at the bot-
tom of Fig. 2 illustrates the proxies are pulled away properly
thanks to imposing proxy regularization.
Proxy-guided Contrastive Learning (PCL). Considering
the knowledge transfer and learning of unlabeled data, it is
difficult to define the positive relations between unlabeled
instances. Like recent work [7, 37], we take advantage
of contrastive learning to learn instance-wise representation
with two augmented views of each sample.
Before developing proxy-guided contrastive learning
(PCL), we firstly capture global structure information of
unlabeled classes by generating a set of proxies in fea-
ture space accordingly, which is marked as Pnew=
{(pu
i, yu
i)|i∈[Cl+ 1, .., Cl+Cu], pu
i∈RD, yu
i=i}.
As shown in yellow lines of Fig. 3, we employ the guid-
ance of both PoldandPnewto mine discriminative features
in contrastive learning. Thus, the input vectors Vof con-
trastive learning become a combination of v, v′, andPold,
Pnew, where the v, v′are the feature vectors extracted from
two views of images. Note that, the positive vector for each
proxy is itself in constrastive learning. The loss of PCL is
written as
LPCL=−|V|X
i=1logexp(vi·v′
i/τ)
P|V|
j=11(i̸=j)exp(vi·vjτ),(10)
where vi,v′
iis a feature vector and its positive vector in
contrastive learning, τis the temperature, and |V|is num-
ber of feature vectors in V. Proxy-guided contrastive loss
learns instance-level representation based on region-aligned
feature maps and separate unlabeled data points in the em-
bedding space. Note that, PCL achieves knowledge transfer
without introducing any inaccurate positive relation, which
optimizes feature distribution with the guidance of proxies.
3.5. Optimization Objective
Our training process comprises a pre-train phase and a dis-
cover phase. In the pre-train phase, we train the whole net-
work with the proposed CRA and PSL modules on Dlto
learn discriminative region representation and generic dis-
tribution information in embedding space:
Lpre−train =αLCRA+βLPC+γLREG, (11)
where weight parameters α,βandγcontrol each loss term.
Specifically, LCRAencourages the network to explore dis-
criminative local features, LPCpull the features and their
corresponding proxies close, and LREGpromotes regular-
ized class distribution in embedding space.
In the discover phase, we initialize proxy set Pnewby
k-means [18] on unlabeled data in Du. Note that, Poldare

to distinguish old classes and recognize new classes. Thus,
we removed proxy regularization in Lpretrain and incorpo-
rate proxy-guided contrastive learning in discover phase:
Ldiscover =αLCRA+βLPC+δLPCL, (12)
where δis weight parameter for proxy-guided contrastive
learning. For the final label assignment, we perform k-
means directly on the extracted feature vector V.
4. Experiment
4.1. Experimental Setup
Data. Our experiments choose five datasets from [31] for
UFG-NCD task, namely SoyAgeing- {R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 }.
These datasets contain leaves from five sequential growth
stages of soybeans. Following the protocol in [10], we take
the initial 99 categories as Cl, and the subsequent ones as
Cu. For NCD scenario, each class encompasses 5 images
for both training and testing. For generalized class discov-
ery (GCD), there are 8 training images and 2 testing images
per class, where unlabeled training data consists of 50% of
the images from Cl, in addition to all images from Cu.
Evaluation Protocol. Following [10, 25], we evaluate
baselines with classification accuracy for labeled images
and the average clustering accuracy (ACC) for unlabeled
ones. Given the application of k-means [18] for assigning
classes to all images, ACC calculations are extended across
all data. The ACC is defined as ACC =1
NPN
i=11(yi=perm max(ˆyi)), where Nis the number of instances for
clustering, and perm maxis the optimal permutation derived
from Hungarian algorithm [14]. Following [7, 8, 10], we
evaluate all methods with task-agnostic andtask-aware pro-
tocols, respectively, indicating separate or joint assessments
of instances from both old and new classes.
Implementation Details. To obtain more discriminative
representation, following common implementation in Ultra-
FGVC [30, 32], we train all methods using a ResNet-50 [11]
backbone with ImageNet [5] pre-trained weights, where the
dimension D= 2048 for feature maps and feature vec-
tor. Furthermore, akin to [25], we project the feature maps
through a three-layer MLP projection head before applying
SemiPL, and discard it at test-time. We resize input im-
ages into 448 ×448 and perform standard data augmentation
as [33], generating two views for each image in the training
process. For our RAPL, we optimize the whole architecture
using SGD with momentum [23]. For each training phase,
the initial learning rate is 0.01 which we decay with a linear
warm-up and cosine annealed scheduler , and weight decay
is set to 10−4. Specifically, we first pre-train the network on
Dlfor 100 epochs, and then jointly fine-tune the network
on both DlandDufor another 100 epochs. The batch size
is set to 24, temperature τis set to 0.1 in contrastive loss,
andβis set to 2 and 1 in the pre-train and discover phase
respectively. We adjust the loss weights based on ACC of
“All” classes, as detailed in Sec. 4.4. All experiments are
conducted on a single RTX 4090 GPU. More comprehen-
sive details are in the Appendix.
4.2. Main Results
We adopt five representative NCD methods acting as base-
lines of UFG-NCD, including RankStats IL[10], UNO [7],
ComEX [28], IIC [16], and rKD [8]. Results for all meth-
ods, using both task-agnostic and task-aware protocols, are
detailed in Tab. 1 (test subset) and Tab. 2 (unlabeled train-
ing subset), respectively. The accuracy results in terms of
“All”, “Old”, and “New”, which denote all instances, and
instances from old or new classes.
Overall, as shown in Tab. 1, our RAPL consistently out-
performs all baselines by a significant margin. Specifically,

our method outperforms the best results of baselines, which
from state-of-the-art NCD methods, i.e., IIC[16] or rKD[8]
with a minimum gain of 3.94% (on SoyAgeing-R6), and a
maximum of 8.38% (on SoyAgeing-R5) for “All” classes.
Interestingly, while rKD shows superior accuracy for “Old”
classes, it underperforms in learning “New” classes, likely
due to its explicit knowledge distillation of old classes to
prevent catastrophic forgetting. Our RAPL method demon-
strates consistent improvements in both “Old” and “New”
categories, proving the effectiveness of our CRA strategy
in capturing generic local representation for UFG images.
This success is further bolstered by knowledge learning and
transfer via SemiPL, which integrates classification knowl-
edge within class-specified proxies and enhances feature-
proxy similarity relations.
The results under task-aware protocol in Tab. 2 show that
our method outperforms baselines on unlabeled training im-
ages. In particular, our method gains more considerable im-
provements than in Tab. 1, e.g., 8.49% on SoyAgeing-R6,
14.19% on SoyAgeing-R4. Note that, SoyAgeing-R6 rep-
resents the final growth cycle of the soybean, where leaves
of each class differentiate into various appearances which
leads to large intra-class variation and makes representation
learning harder. Thus, the results of SoyAgeing-R6 are rel-
atively lower than those on other UFG datasets, because in-
sufficient representation learning on labeled data leads to
weak knowledge transfer on unlabeled ones.
4.3. Ablation Study
In Tab. 3, we report the ablation results on SoyAgeing-
R1 by individually removing each component of RAPL,
i.e.,LPC,LREG,LCRAandLPCL, represents proxy-
guided classification, proxy regularization, channel-wise re-
gion alignment, and proxy augmented contrastive learning.
Contrastive Learning. We verify the effectiveness of PCL
by performing vanilla contrastive learning without the guid-
ance of proxies. Comparing the Rows (1) and (4), PCL
outperforms vanilla contrastive learning by 2.63% on “All”
classes for SoyAgeing-R1. This implies that with the guid-
ance of global distribution information of proxies in em-
bedding space, the network learns a more comprehensive
representation of UFG images in the discover stage.

Channel-wise Region Alignment. Rows (2) and (4) show
the effect of the channel-wise region alignment for UFG-
NCD. We observe a near 2% increase across ACC on “All”
classes, with a more pronounced increase for the “old”
class. This demonstrates that our CRA serves as a platform
for effective representation learning and knowledge trans-
fer. Especially when encountering labeled data, label infor-
mation encourages learning discriminative features within
specific common regions via LCRA. Besides, LCRAfacil-
itates representation learning on unlabeled data by sharing
local knowledge across data samples and proxies.
Proxy Regularization. We observe a further performance
improvement across ACC on “All” and “Old” classes af-
ter introducing proxy regularization from Rows (3) and (4).
This indicates that regularization on Poldfurther learns the
difference between each class which is represented by prox-
ies and embeds global distribution information with Pold,
which is conducive to separating old classes on embedding
space with relaxed margins.
4.4. Hyper-Parameter Analysis
In this section, we investigate the impact of the hyper-
parameters in each training phase.
Impact of Loss Weights. We study the effect of each loss
weight when fixing others. Specifically, we first choose the
optimal αwhen γandδare both set to 1.0, then we deter-
mine the best γbased on selected αand select the optimal δ
similarly. The impact of different values of each loss weight
is shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c). Eventually, the hyper-parameters
used in our method are set to α= 0.6, γ= 1.0, andδ= 0.8.
Impact of Number of Selected Proxies in LPC.We study
the effect of kwith above optimal loss weights, where we
define k=ξ·ClinLPC. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the best
performance is achieved when ξ= 0.05, indicating that
focus on separating similar classes is conducive to mining
the subtle differences between UFG images.

4.5. Further Investigation of RAPL
Evaluation on GCD Setting. To further evaluate the effec-
tiveness of RAPL, we implement RAPL and two represen-
tative algorithms [6, 25] on the UFG dataset under the GCD
setting. Note that, we use ResNet-50 with ImageNet pre-
trained weights for GCD and XCon for a fair comparison.
As shown in Tab. 4, our RAPL consistently outperforms the
GCD methods by over 10% on SoyAgeing- {R1,R3,R4,R5 },
6.22% on SoyAgeing-R6. Since classification heads must
be trained from scratch, they are vulnerable to overfitting on
the labeled classes after the pre-train phase of NCD. To this
end, GCD and XCon turn to optimize the network with con-
trastive learning for more generalized feature representation
in one stage. Nevertheless, the results reproted on Tab. 4
demonstrate that optimizing the network with RAPL boosts
both representation learning on labeled and unlabeled in-
stances, and avoids overfitting on the old data.
Visualization of Feature Distributions. To qualitatively
explore the clustered features on the UFG dataset, we vi-
sualize the t-SNE embeddings based on UNO [7] and our
RAPL. Clearly, the feature embeddings optimized with our
RAPL become more discriminative and less overlap in the
embedding space than UNO.
Generalization Performance of RAPL. Since SoyAgeing-
{R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 }are collected in different growth
stages of soybean, where larger numbers represent later
stages, we further investigate the generalization capabil-
ity of RAPL when testing on the different datasets. As
shown in Fig. 6, RAPL achieves greater generalization ca-
pability between nearly growth stages, e.g., the performance
of RAPL when training with SoyAgeing-R6 decreases on
other datasets as the growth stage decreases. This tendency

indicates that we can explore knowledge transfer across im-
ages of different ultra-fine-grained datasets to promote the
classification of unlabeled UFG images.
5. Conclusion
We have proposed a task exploiting novel class discov-
ery for ultra-fine-grained visual categorization, termed as
UFG-NCD. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple
yet effective framework named region-aligned proxy learn-
ing (RAPL), promoting the representation learning of local
regions and the knowledge transfer from labeled to unla-
beled images. Our RAPL is comprised of a channel-wise
region alignment module to extract local representation, and
a novel semi-supervised proxy learning framework to facil-
itate representation learning based on the relations between
class-level proxies and instances. Experimental results on
five datasets show that RAPL achieves state-of-the-art per-
formance. In the future, RAPL has the potential to be ap-
plied to other ultra-fine-grained scenarios.
