Abstract
In the domain of compressive sensing (CS), deep unfold-
ing networks (DUNs) have garnered attention for their good
performance and certain degree of interpretability rooted
in CS domain, achieved by marrying traditional optimiza-
tion solvers with deep networks. However, current DUNs
are ill-suited for the intricate task of capturing fine-grained
image details, leading to perceptible distortions and blurri-
ness in reconstructed images, particularly at low CS ratios,
e.g., 0.10 and below. In this paper, we propose CPP-Net, a
novel deep unfolding CS framework, inspired by the primal-
dual hybrid strategy of the Chambolle and Pock Proximal
Point Algorithm (CP-PPA). First, we derive three iteration
submodules, X(k),V(k)andY(k), by incorporating cus-
tomized deep learning modules to solve the sparse basis
related proximal operator within CP-PPA. Second, we de-
sign the Dual Path Fusion Block (DPFB) to adeptly extract
and fuse multi-scale feature information, enhancing sensi-
tivity to feature information at different scales and improv-
ing detail reconstruction. Third, we introduce the Itera-
tion Fusion Strategy (IFS) to effectively weight the fusion of
outputs from diverse reconstruction stages, maximizing the
utilization of feature information and mitigating the infor-
mation loss during reconstruction stages. Extensive experi-
ments demonstrate that CPP-Net effectively reduces distor-
tion and blurriness while preserving richer image details,
outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Codes are

1. Introduction
Compressive Sensing (CS) stands as a pivotal signal pro-
cessing technique, facilitating the recovery of sparse or
compressible signals from significantly fewer measure-
ments than required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling the-

orem [5]. This capability accelerates signal acquisition,
leading to a substantial reduction in sampling costs and data
storage requirements. Furthermore, its advent has spurred
advancements in various research domains, encompassing
signal processing [4] in diverse areas such as applied math-
ematics [39], computational imaging [9, 10, 23, 34], com-
puter science [49], etc. These explorations have profoundly
propelled the development of CS theory, giving rising to
various practical applications, including but not limited to
natural image CS [20, 40, 41] and CS magnetic resonance
imaging (CS-MRI) [22, 33, 36].
The CS sampling process can be expressed as b=Φx,
where x∈RNdenotes the original signal, Φ∈RM×N

sents the measurements derived from x, and the CS ratio τ
is defined asM

is to recover xfrom this underdetermined system. Conven-

Traditional optimization algorithms [2, 3, 12, 15] aim
to discover solutions that not only align with the measure-
ments but also encourage sparsity in the sparse domain.
These approaches excels at handling problems with sparse
constraints and offers robust theoretical foundations. How-
ever, they often demand high computational complexity and
require manual parameter selection and tuning for various
datasets. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has been in-
troduced into the field of image CS, giving rise to pure
DL-based CS methods [13, 14, 21, 25, 28, 32, 37, 48],
which employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or
Transformers to learn the mapping relationship between
measurements and original images. However, these pure
DL-based methods remain a black box with limited trans-
parency and interpretability, particularly within the CS do-
main, constraining their broader utility and further devel-
opment. To bridge the gap between DL and traditional
optimization algorithms, deep unfolding networks (DUNs)
[29, 31, 36, 41, 43, 46] incorporate DL architectures into
the iterative steps of optimization algorithms. This combi-
nation not only brings the benefits of rapid reconstruction
and adaptive learning of parameters, but also introduces a
degree of interpretability rooted in the CS domain.
However, existing DUNs struggle to capture fine-grained
image details, resulting in noticeable degradation, including
distortions and blurriness, especially at low CS ratios, e.g.,
0.10 or lower. This is primarily due to two key challenges:
•Inadequate extraction and fusion of multi-scale fea-
ture information : Current DUNs often focus on op-
timizing images at high CS ratios, and are inadequate
in extracting and fusing feature information at various
scales from images, resulting in a lack of sensitivity to
fine-grained image features. This deficiency compro-
mises their ability to process fine-grained details accu-
rately, such as subtle textures, edges, and intricate details
when measurements are limited.
•Information fusion deficiency of different reconstruc-
tion stages : DUNs typically consist of multiple iterative
reconstruction stages responsible for extracting and pro-
cessing specific image information. However, existingmethods often struggle to balance and fuse this informa-
tion effectively, resulting in information loss and confu-
sion. This flawed information fusion strategy can impact
DUNs’ performance, as different stages of information
may have varying importance and contributions to the fi-
nal reconstruction.
Furthermore, image details are pivotal for image content
recognition and analysis. Particularly at low CS ratios, en-
hancing image details becomes especially vital to fully ex-
ploit the advantages of CS, such as resource-efficient trans-
mission and storage. Consequently, the reconstruction of
image details at low CS ratios is a vital and challenging task
to ensure high-quality image perception.
To address these challenges, we propose CPP-Net, a
novel deep unfolding framework inspired by the Cham-
bolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (CP-PPA), as il-
lustrated in Fig. 2. By integrating a customized DL mod-
ule into the iterative optimization solvers of CP-PPA to ad-
dress the problem of sparse basis related to proximal op-
erator, we derive and establish the deep unfolding CP-PPA
framework, comprising three iteration submodules: X(k),
V(k), andY(k). Subsequently, building upon the proposed
framework, we design the Dual Path Fusion Block (DPFB),
which employs up and down sampling as well as Multi-
Scale Transformer Block (MSTB) to proficiently extract
and fuse multi-scale feature information. Additionally, we
introduce the Iteration Fusion Strategy (IFS) by concate-
nating outputs from different reconstruction stages in the
channel dimension and applying attentional weighting for
adaptive fusion. The main contributions are summarized as
follows:
• We propose CPP-Net, a novel deep unfolding framework
for CS, drawing inspiration from the primal-dual hybrid
strategy of CP-PPA, achieving superior reconstructed im-
age and human perception quality.
• We design the Dual Path Fusion Block (DPFB) as an ex-
tension of the sparse basis structure associated with the
proximal operator within CPP-Net to adeptly extract and
fuse multi-scale feature information, enhancing sensitiv-
ity at different scales and improving detail reconstruction.
• We introduce the Iteration Fusion Strategy (IFS) to ef-
fectively weight the fusion of information from different
reconstruction stages in CPP-Net, maximizing feature uti-

2.1. Traditional Chambolle and Pock Proximal
Point Algorithm
The Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (CP-
PPA) [6, 16, 17] is a straightforward yet powerful optimiza-
tion algorithm that utilizes an enhanced primal-dual hybrid
approach [50], offering convergence and efficiency. Con-
sider the following saddle-point problem:
min
x∈RNmax
y∈RMΘ(x,y) :=θ1(x)−y⊤Φx−θ2(y),(2)
where Φ∈RM×N. The CP-PPA solves this problem
through following iterative steps:
x(k+1)= arg min
xΘ(x,y(k)) +α
2∥x−x(k)∥2
ℓ2,(3)v(k+1)= 2x(k+1)−x(k), (4)
y(k+1)= arg max
yΘ(v(k+1),y)−β
2∥y−y(k)∥2
ℓ2,(5)
where αandβare regularization parameters.
CP-PPA addresses both the primal and dual prob-
lems alternately and iteratively, and achieves faster con-
vergence compared to the widely-used Iterative Shrink-
age/Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) [2, 6], which solely op-
timizes the primal problem. Furthermore, CP-PPA provides
stronger convergence guarantees, increasing its potential to
theoretically attain globally optimal solutions [17]. How-
ever, as a traditional iterative optimization algorithm, CP-
PPA has its limitations. Its performance heavily relies on
parameter settings, particularly the choice of αandβ. In-
accurate parameter choices can lead to slow convergence or
system instability [17]. Additionally, for the problem out-
lined in Eq. (1), a persistent challenge remains in the se-
lection of an appropriate sparse basis Ψdue to the diverse
content and characteristics of images [1].
2.2. Deep Unfolding Networks
The core idea of DUNs is to unfold the traditional itera-
tive optimization algorithms into the form of deep networks,
25088
making it an end-to-end trainable model. DUNs offer the
combined advantages of rapid reconstruction and adaptive
learning of parameters, while introducing interpretability
rooted in the CS domain.
Since Zhang and Ghanem proposed ISTA-Net [41],
based on the famous ISTA algorithm (a special case
of Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm for ℓ1-
regularization term), these are many ISTA-based network
variants have been gradually proposed for CS, including
OPINE-Net+[42], TransCS [27], OCTUF [31], DGUNet+
[24], and others [7, 8, 24, 29, 30]. Similarly, Yang et al.
proposed ADMM-CSNet [36] based on the Alternating Di-
rection Method of Multipliers (ADMM) [3]; Zhang et al.
proposed AMP-Net [46] inspired by the Approximate Mes-
sage Passing (AMP) [12] for CS, and so on. Nevertheless,
current DUNs usually neglect the enhancement of details at
different scales in images at low CS ratios, and at the same
time are insufficient for the transfer and utilization of infor-
mation from different stages, resulting in significant degra-
dation, e.g., distortions and blurriness, in reconstructed im-
ages. For example, OCTUF [31] utilizes cross-attention
mechanisms to optimize the image but disregards the finer
image details of various scales, leading to substantial areas
of blurring. Similarly, while DGUNet+[24] utilizes down-
sampling for encoding and up-sampling for decoding to un-
fold PGD, it lacks effective fusion of feature information
across different scales. This deficiency results in notice-
able distortions in the reconstructed images. In this paper,
we propose CPP-Net, a novel deep unfolding framework
inspired by the CP-PPA with efficient multi-scale feature
fusion to achieve precise image detail reconstruction.
3. Proposed Method
The details of our CPP-Net are illustrated in Fig. 3. CPP-
Net includes one initialization module and Kreconstruction
stages, with the default setting of eight stages. Each stage
represents one iteration in the CP-PPA, and consists of three
iteration submodules ( X(k),V(k)andY(k)) and one DPFB.
3.1. Initialization Module
As shown in Fig. 3, initialization module responds to an
initial estimate P(0)from the measurements and initialize
the iteration parameters A(0).P(k)contains the iterative
auxiliary variables ( x(k)andy(k)), while A(k)contains the
downsampling results at different scales ( x(k)
0,x(k)
1,x(k)
2
andx(k)
3) in the k-th reconstruction stages. In order to fa-
cilitate convolutional operations and iterative computations,
we use Fvec(·)andeFvec(·)to denote the chunking and flat-
tening functions as well as their inverse processes, respec-
tively.3.2. Reconstruction Stages
Iteration Submodules . We introduce a DL-based opera-
tor, denoted as D(·), to replace Ψ, which offers enhanced
adaptability to various images and a high degree of self-
adjustment without the need for manual parameter tun-
ing. We define two functions: f(x) = λ∥D(x)∥ℓ1and
h(z) =1
2∥z−b∥2
ℓ2. Therefore, we reformulate the Eq. (1)
as a saddle-point problem, expressed as:
min
x∈RNmax
y∈RMΘ(x,y) :=f(x) +y⊤Φx−h∗(y).(6)
Here, h∗is the convex conjugate of the convex lower-
semicontinuous function h:
h∗(y) = sup
z∈RMz⊤y−1
2∥z−b∥2
ℓ2. (7)
By alternately iterating and optimizing the primal and dual
problems, and independently learning regularization terms
α,βandλfor each iteration, iterative steps can be derived
as follows:
x(k)= arg min
xΘ(x,y(k−1))+α(k)
2∥x−x(k−1)∥2
ℓ2,(8)
v(k)= 2x(k)−x(k−1), (9)
y(k)= arg max
yΘ(v(k),y)−β(k)
2∥y−y(k−1)∥2
ℓ2.(10)
Since the constant term is independent of the solution, the
solution for Eq. (8) can be expressed as:
x(k)= arg min
xf(x) + (y(k−1))⊤Φx+1
2η(k)∥x−x(k−1)∥2
ℓ2
= arg min
xf(x) +1
2η(k)∥x−x(k−1)+η(k)Φ⊤y(k−1)∥2
ℓ2,
(11)
where η(k)= 1/α(k).x(k)can be obtained using the soft
thresholding function denoted as S(·), a special proximal
operator for ℓ1-norm:
x(k)=eD(Sλ(k)η(k)(D(x(k−1)−η(k)Φ⊤y(k−1)))),(12)
where
Sϵ(x) = sgn( x)∗max(|x| −ϵ,0), (13)
andeD(·)represents the left inverse of D(·). Similarly, solv-
ing for y(k)in Eq. (10) is equivalent to:
y(k)= arg min
yh∗(y)−y⊤Φv(k)+1
2δ(k)∥y−y(k−1)∥2
ℓ2
= arg min
yh∗(y) +1
2δ(k)∥y−y(k−1)−δ(k)Φv(k)∥2
ℓ2
= proxδ(k)h∗(y(k−1)+δ(k)Φv(k))
=1
1 +δ(k)(y(k−1)+δ(k)(Φv(k)−b)),
(14)
25089
where prox(·)denotes the proximal operator and δ(k)=
1/β(k).
In summary, for the sake of convenience in iterative and
convolutional operations, we can express the explicit solu-
tions for the iteration submodules X(k),V(k), andY(k)in
thek-th reconstruction stages as follows:


X(k):x(k)=eD(Sλ(k)η(k)(D(
x(k−1)−η(k)eFvec(Φ⊤y(k−1))))),
V(k):v(k)= 2x(k)−x(k−1),
Y(k):y(k)=1
1 +δ(k)(y(k−1)+δ(k)(ΦFvec(v(k))−b)).
(15)
The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is pre-
sented in the Supplementary Material (Sec. 2). The essence
of our CPP-Net resides in the structure eD(S(D(·))). There-
fore, we design the DPFB as an extension of eD(S(D(·)))to
enhance CPP-Net’s capability for characterizing informa-
tion and to achieve effective extraction and fusion of multi-
scale features. DPFB consists mainly of DCABs, MSTBs
and STRes. The specific details are presented below.
Depth-wise Channel Attention Block (DCAB) . We in-
troduce the DCAB as the fundamental building block to en-
hance the feature extraction and attentional weighting capa-
bilities of our CPP-Net. As illustrated in Fig. 3(c), DCAB
begins with a 3×3depth-wise convolution ( DConv 3) to
extract spatial information, followed by a layer normaliza-
tion (LN) to enhance stability. It then employs two 1×1
convolutions ( Conv 1) to expand and reduce the channel
count, with a Gaussian error linear units (GELU) activation

tention block inspired by [18] to highlight informative fea-
tures while suppressing less relevant ones across channels
to achieve adaptive weighting.
Multi-Scale Transformer Block (MSTB) . We design
the MSTB, a composition of LN, Multi-Scale Cross At-
tention (MSCA) and DCAB, to improve the aggregation
and fusion of feature information across various scales. As
shown in Fig. 3(b), MSTB takes two inputs of varying
scales, applies LN to each, and then processes them through
the MSCA. Following the residual connection, the feature
undergoes further refinement via the DCAB. Assuming that
x(k)∈RC×H×Wandx(k)
i∈RrC×H/r×W/rrepresent the
inputs to the MSCA, the process unfolds as follows: Ini-
tially, x(k)undergoes Global Average Pooling (GAP) along
both the width ( GAP W:RC×H×W→RC×H×1) and
height ( GAP H:RC×H×W→RC×1×W) dimensions, pro-
ducing Query Q2and Key K1, respectively. Similarly, x(k)
i
generates the corresponding Q1andK2after reshaping.
Moreover, Vis derived from x(k)by applying a depth-wise
3×3convolution, followed by a GELU activation, and fi-
nally a 1×1convolution. The process can be representedAlgorithm 1 CPP-Net

Here, R(·)denotes the reshape function. Subsequently,
the Queries and Keys generated by these two inputs un-
dergo the matrix multiplication, resulting in two matrices
inRC×H×W. These matrices are then subjected to channel
downscaling and upscaling through two 1×1convolutions,
followed by the Sigmoid function to obtain the correspond-
ing attention weights. The MSCA output, denoted as ex(k),
is computed by the Hadamard product of Vwith the ob-
tained attention weights:
ex(k)= SG( Q1⊗K1)⊙SG(Q2⊗K2)⊙V, (17)
where SG(·) = Sigmoid(Conv 1(GELU(Conv 1(·)))).
Dual Path Fusion Block (DPFB) . Our approach prior-
itizes the efficient extraction and fusion of multi-scale fea-
tures to enhance performance of details reconstruction. To
achieve this, we design the DPFB as the cornerstone of our
CPP-Net framework, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The DPFB
begins with an initial step that includes a 1×1convolu-
tion and a 3×3depth-wise convolution to increase channel
count. It then downsamples the feature maps using 2×2
convolutions with a stride of 2 ( Conv 2), which reduces the
feature maps’ size by half while doubling the channel count,
facilitating efficient capture of multi-scale features. Further-
more, the DPFB effectively fuses multi-scale information

through two pathways: one involves up-sampling the ac-
quired multi-scale features using a 2×2transposed con-
volution ( ConvT 2) with a stride of 2 and residual connec-
tions, while the other employs three MSTBs for weighted
feature fusion at different scales. The outputs from these
two pathways, along with the feature maps from the pre-
vious stage ( x(k−1)
0 ), are concatenated along the channel
dimension. Subsequently, the DPFB employs DCABs and
1×1convolutions to achieve effective attentional weighted
fusion, resulting in two output feature maps: x(k)
0andx(k).
We also introduce the Soft Thresholding Residual connec-
tion (STRes), inspired by [47], as an adaptive method for
threshold adjustment.
Iteration Fusion Strategy (IFS) . Upon completing K
reconstruction stages, in order to maximize the utilization
of output features at each stage while reducing information
loss across stages, we perform the following steps: First, we
concatenate the outputs x(k)andx(k)
0from each stage along
the channel dimension. Then we employ the DCABs and
1×1convolutions to achieve attentional weighted feature
fusion across iterative reconstruction stages, contributing to
the final output image denoted as ˆx:
ˆx=Fpost(Concat( {x(k)}K
k=0,{x(k)
0}K
k=0)), (18)
where Concat denotes the concatenation along the channel
dimension. In summary, the proposed CPP-Net is described
in Algorithm 1.3.3. Loss Function
We define the training set of images as {xi}n
i=1, where nis
the number of training images. To quantify the dissimilarity
between the reconstructed image ˆxiand the corresponding
ground truth image xi, we employ the ℓ2-loss. The sam-
pling matrix Φis jointly learned through the successive re-
construction stages. Consequently, the loss function is for-
mulated as follows:
L(Θ) =1

where Θrepresents the set of learnable parameters for our
proposed CPP-Net.

The best and second-best results in the tables are high-
lighted in red and blue colors, respectively. As detailed in
Tab. 1, our CPP-Net consistently outperforms all competing
methods across various cases, excelling in both PSNR and

CPP-Net surpasses AutoBCS [13], CSformer [37], DPC-
DUN [30], OCTUF [31], and TCS-Net [14] by approxi-
mately 1.94 dB (7.16%), 1.23 dB (4.42%), 2.43 dB (9.13%),

(10.00%), 0.0162 (1.99%), and 0.0572 (7.42%). Further-
more, visual comparisons of the reconstructed image details
are presented in Fig. 4. These comparisons reveal that im-
ages reconstructed by CPP-Net exhibit a notable reduction
in block artifacts, a common issue observed in ISTA-Net+
[41], CSNet+[28], DGUNet+[24], TransCS [27], CS-
former, and TCS-Net. Moreover, these competing methods,
e.g., AMP-Net [46], CASNet [7], FSOINet [8], DGUNet+,
DPC-DUN, CSformer and OCTUF, exhibit susceptibility
to blurring and the omission of fine image details, leading
to compromised visual perception and overall image qual-
ity. Conversely, CPP-Net’s reconstructed images showcase
a superior preservation of fine image details, thereby de-
livering an enhanced visual experience, higher human per-
ception quality and overall image quality. Furthermore, de-
tailed experimental settings and more comparisons can be
found in Supplementary Material (Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 3.2).
4.2. Ablation Studies
In this part, we conducted the ablation studies to investigate
the impact of the number of stages and the effectiveness of
the different components of our proposed CPP-Net.

stages in our CPP-Net on Set14 at a CS ratio of 0.25.

Number of stages . We investigated the impact of thenumber of reconstruction stages in CPP-Net, specifically 3,
5, 7, 8 (the default setting) and 9 stages, to explore the ben-
efits associated with different stage counts. As shown in
Tab. 2, we observe a direct correlation between the number
of stages and the performance, highlighting the efficacy of
our iterative network design. As a result, we choose eight
stages as the default configuration, as it strikes a balanced
compromise between model complexity and performance.

Different components . We conducted ablation experi-

Net. The experimental cases are detailed in Tab. 3, and the
corresponding results are summarized in Tab. 4. Our re-
sults show that the inclusion of DPFB ( i.e., STRes, DS, US,
DCAB, MSTB) and IFS leads to progressive improvements
of our method’s performance. The default CPP-Net out-

performs other cases and alternatives, achieving the highest
PSNR and SSIM, while Net-5 ranks second except on Ur-
ban100.

4.3. Performance under Noise
We evaluated the performance of our CPP-Net under differ-
ent levels of noise to show the robustness of our method. We
first added Gaussian noise to the images of Set11 and then
evaluated the performance of our CPP-Net under noisy im-
ages. As shown in Fig. 5, the performance of each method
decreases as the variance increases, but CPP-Net still out-
performs the other methods at all tested Gaussian noise lev-
els. Besides, performance under salt-and-pepper noise is
presented in the Supplementary Material (Sec. 3.3).

We expanded CPP-Net into the domain of CS-MRI, aim-
ing to reconstruct magnetic resonance images from partial
Fourier data. In this context, the sampling matrix Φis
defined by a partial Fourier transform matrix, specifically
Φ=SF. Here, Srepresents a sub-sampling mask, and
Fcorresponds to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). To
assess the performance, we utilized the same set of training
and testing brain images as used in previous works [36, 41],
using Pseudo Radial masks as S. The results are summa-
rized in Tab. 5. Notably, our CPP-Net consistently outper-

forms other methods across all tested CS ratios. This supe-
rior performance is further illustrated in Fig. 6, emphasizing
the CPP-Net’s capacity to capture richer details and pro-
vide superior image quality compared to alternative meth-
ods. Besides, additional CS-MRI experiments are presented
in the Supplementary Material (Sec. 3.4).
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose CPP-Net, a novel deep unfold-
ing framework inspired by CP-PPA. We then enhance the
framework in two key aspects: with DPFB for multi-scale
feature extraction and fusion, and IFS for information-
weighted fusion across iterative reconstruction stages. Ex-
tensive experiments validate CPP-Net’s superior perfor-
mance in preserving image details beyond current SOTA
methods. Future work aims to extend CPP-Net to diverse
tasks, e.g., image denoising, deraining and super-resolution.
