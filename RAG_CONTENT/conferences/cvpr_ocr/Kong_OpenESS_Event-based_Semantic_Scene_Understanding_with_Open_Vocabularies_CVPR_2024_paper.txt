Abstract
Event-based semantic segmentation (ESS) is a funda-
mental yet challenging task for event camera sensing. The
difficulties in interpreting and annotating event data limit
its scalability. While domain adaptation from images to
event data can help to mitigate this issue, there exist data
representational differences that require additional effort to
resolve. In this work, for the first time, we synergize infor-
mation from image, text, and event-data domains and intro-
duce OpenESS to enable scalable ESS in an open-world,
annotation-efficient manner. We achieve this goal by trans-
ferring the semantically rich CLIP knowledge from image-
text pairs to event streams. To pursue better cross-modality
adaptation, we propose a frame-to-event contrastive dis-
tillation and a text-to-event semantic consistency regular-
ization. Experimental results on popular ESS benchmarks
showed our approach outperforms existing methods. No-tably, we achieve 53.93% and 43.31% mIoU on DDD17 and
DSEC-Semantic without using either event or frame labels.
1. Introduction
Event cameras, often termed bio-inspired vision sensors,
stand distinctively apart from traditional frame-based cam-
eras and are often merited by their low latency, high dy-
namic range, and low power consumption [27, 43, 76]. The
realm of event-based vision perception, though nascent, has
rapidly evolved into a focal point of contemporary research
[99]. Drawing parallels with frame-based perception and
recognition methodologies, a plethora of task-specific ap-
plications leveraging event cameras have burgeoned [24].
Event-based semantic segmentation (ESS) emerges as
one of the core event perception tasks and has gained in-
creasing attention [2, 6, 37, 78]. ESS inherits the challenges
of traditional image segmentation [10, 11, 18, 38, 58], while

also contending with the unique properties of event data
[2], which opens up a plethora of opportunities for explo-
ration. Although accurate and efficient dense predictions
from event cameras are desirable for practical applications,
the learning and annotation of the sparse, asynchronous, and
high-temporal-resolution event streams pose several chal-
lenges [46, 48, 61]. Stemming from the image segmentation
community, existing ESS models are trained on densely an-
notated events within a fixed andlimited set of label map-
ping [2, 78]. Such closed-set learning from expensive anno-
tations inevitably constrains the scalability of ESS systems.
An obvious approach will be to make use of the image
domain and transfer knowledge to event data for the same
vision tasks. Several recent attempts [29, 61, 78] resort to
unsupervised domain adaptation to avoid the need for paired
image and event data annotations for training. These meth-
ods demonstrate the potential of leveraging frame annota-
tions to train a segmentation model for event data. How-
ever, transferring knowledge across frames and events is
not straightforward and requires intermediate representa-
tions such as voxel grids, frame-like reconstructions, and
bio-inspired spikes. Meanwhile, it is also costly to annotate
dense frame labels for training, which limits their usage.
A recent trend inclines to the use of multimodal founda-
tion models [12, 49, 67, 69, 94] to train task-specific mod-
els in an open-vocabulary and zero-shot manner, removing
dependencies on human annotations. This paper continues
such a trend. We propose a novel open-vocabulary frame-
work for ESS, aiming at transferring pre-trained knowledge
from both image and text domains to learn better represen-
tations of event data for the dense scene understanding task.
Observing the large domain gap in between heterogeneous
inputs, we design two cross-modality representation learn-
ing objectives that gradually align the event streams with
images and texts. As shown in Fig. 1, given raw events
and text prompts as the input, the learned feature represen-
tations from our OpenESS framework exhibit promising re-
sults for known and unknown class segmentation and can
be extended to more open-ended texts such as “adjectives” ,
“fine-grained” , and “coarse-grained” descriptions.
To sum up, this work poses key contributions as follows:
• We introduce OpenESS, a versatile event-based seman-
tic segmentation framework capable of generating open-
world dense event predictions given arbitrary text queries.
• To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the
first attempt at distilling large vision-language models to
assist event-based semantic scene understanding tasks.
• We propose a frame-to-event (F2E) contrastive distilla-
tion and a text-to-event (T2E) consistency regularization
to encourage effective cross-modality knowledge transfer.
• Our approach sets up a new state of the art in annotation-
free, annotation-efficient, and fully-supervised ESS set-
tings on DDD17-Seg andDSEC-Semantic benchmarks.2. Related Work
Event-based Vision. The microsecond-level temporal res-
olution, high dynamic range (typically 140dBvs.60dB
of standard cameras), and power consumption efficiency of
event cameras have posed a paradigm shift from traditional
frame-based imaging [24, 60, 77, 108]. A large variety of
event-based recognition, perception, localization, and re-
construction tasks have been established, encompassing ob-
ject recognition [17, 28, 47, 68], object detection [26, 30,
103, 109], depth estimation [16, 35, 41, 62, 65, 70], optical
flow [19, 32, 33, 53, 80, 81, 105], intensity-image recon-
struction [22, 23, 73, 98, 107], visual odometry and SLAM
[42, 56, 72], stereoscopic panoramic imaging [4, 75], etc. In
this work, we focus on the recently-emerged task of event-
based semantic scene understanding [2, 78]. Such a pur-
suit is anticipated to tackle sparse, asynchronous, and high-
temporal-resolution events for dense predictions, which is
crucial for safety-critical in-drone or in-vehicle perceptions.
Event-based Semantic Segmentation. The focus of ESS is
on categorizing events into semantic classes for enhancing
scene interpretation. Alonso et al. [2] contributed the first
benchmark based on DDD17 [5]. Subsequent works are tai-
lored to improve the accuracy while mitigating the need for
extensive event annotations [29]. EvDistill [84] and DTL
[83] utilized aligned frames to enhance event-based learn-
ing. EV-Transfer [61] and ESS [78] leveraged domain adap-
tation to transfer knowledge from existing image datasets
to events. Recently, HALSIE [6] and HMNet [37] inno-
vated ESS in cross-domain feature synthesis and memory-
based event encoding. Another line of research pursues
to use of spiking neural networks for energy-efficient ESS
[9, 48, 63, 90]. In this work, different from previous pur-
suits, we aim to train ESS models in an annotation-free
manner by distilling pre-trained vision-language models,
hoping to address scalability and annotation challenges.
Open-Vocabulary Learning. Recent advances in vision-
language models open up new possibilities for visual per-
ceptions [12, 88, 106]. Such trends encompass image-based
zero-shot and open-vocabulary detection [25, 52, 89, 96], as
well as semantic [34, 50, 55, 97, 100], instance [44, 87], and
panoptic [20, 40, 93] segmentation. As far as we know, only
three works studied the adaptation of CLIP for event-based
recognition. EventCLIP [92] proposed to convert events
to a 2D grid map and use an adapter to align event fea-
tures with CLIP’s knowledge. E-CLIP [102] uses a hier-
archical triple contrastive alignment that jointly unifies the
event, image, and text feature embedding. Ev-LaFOR [17]
designed category-guided attraction and category-agnostic
repulsion losses to bridge event with CLIP. Differently, we
present the first attempt at adapting CLIP for dense pre-
dictions on sparse and asynchronous event streams. Our
work is also close to superpixel-driven contrastive learn-
ing [45, 74], where pre-processed superpixels are used to

tasks, e.g., point cloud understanding [57], remote sensing
[36], medical imaging [82], and so on. In this work, we
propose OpenESS to explore superpixel-to-event represen-
tation learning. Extensive experiments verify that such an
approach is promising for annotation-efficient ESS.
3. Methodology
Our study serves as an early attempt at leveraging vision-
language foundation models like CLIP [69] to learn mean-
ingful event representations without accessing ground-truth
labels. We start with a brief introduction of the CLIP model
(cf. Sec. 3.1), followed by a detailed elaboration on our pro-
posed open-vocabulary ESS ( cf. Sec. 3.2). To encourage ef-
fective cross-modal event representation learning, we intro-
duce a frame-to-event contrastive distillation ( cf. Sec. 3.3)
and a text-to-event consistency regularization ( cf. Sec. 3.4).
An overview of the OpenESS framework is shown in Fig. 2.
3.1. Revisiting CLIP
CLIP [69] learns to associate images with textual descrip-
tions through a contrastive learning framework. It leverages
a dataset of 400million image-text pairs, training an im-
age encoder (based on a ResNet [38] or Vision Transformer
[21]) and a text encoder (using a Transformer architecture
[79]) to project images and texts into a shared embedding
space. Such a training paradigm enables CLIP to perform
zero-shot classification tasks, identifying images based ontextual descriptions without specific training on those cate-
gories. To achieve annotation-free classification on a cus-
tom dataset, one needs to combine class label mappings
with hand-crafted text prompts as the input to generate the
text embedding. In this work, we aim to leverage the seman-
tically rich CLIP feature space to assist open-vocabulary
dense prediction on sparse and asynchronous event streams.
3.2. Open-Vocabulary ESS
Inputs. Given a set of Nevent data acquired by an event
camera, we aim to segment each event eiamong the tem-
porally ordered event streams εi, which are encoded by
the pixel coordinates (xi,yi), microsecond-level timestamp
ti, and the polarity pi∈ {− 1,+1}which indicates ei-
ther an increase or decrease of the brightness. Each event
camera pixel generates a spike whenever it perceives a
change in logarithmic brightness that surpasses a predeter-
mined threshold. Meanwhile, a conventional camera cap-
tures gray-scale or color frames Iimg
i∈R3×H×Wwhich
are spatially aligned and temporally synchronized with the
events or can be aligned and synchronized to events via sen-
sor calibration, where HandWare the spatial resolutions.
Event Representations. Due to the sparsity, high tempo-
ral resolution, and asynchronous nature of event streams, it
is common to convert raw events εiinto more regular rep-
resentations Ievt

network [24], where Cdenotes the number of embedding

themselves. Some popular choices of such embedding in-
clude spatiotemporal voxel grids [28, 104, 105], frame-like
reconstructions [73], and bio-inspired spikes [48]. We in-
vestigate these three methods and show an example of tak-
ing voxel grids as the input in Fig. 2. More analyses and
comparisons using reconstructions and spikes are in later
sections. Specifically, with a predefined number of events,
each voxel grid is built from non-overlapping windows as:

j−t|,0},

j= (B−1)tj−t0
∆T
is the normalized event timestamp with Bas the number of
temporal bins in an event stream; ∆Tis the time window
andt0denotes the time of the first event in the window.
Cross-Modality Encoding. LetFevt

RD1×H1×W1be an event-based segmentation network with
trainable parameters θe, which takes as input an event
embedding Ievt
iand outputs a D1-dimensional feature of
downsampled spatial sizes H1andW1. Meanwhile, we
integrate CLIP’s image encoder Fclip
θc:R3×H×W7→
RD2×H2×W2into our framework and keep the parameters
θcfixed. The output is a D2-dimensional feature of sizes
H2andW2. Our motivation is to transfer general knowl-
edge from Fclip
θctoFevt
θe, such that the event branch can
learn useful representations without using dense event an-
notations. To enable open-vocabulary ESS predictions, we
leverage CLIP’s text encoder Ftxt
θtwith pre-trained param-
eters θt. The input of Ftxt
θtcomes from predefined text
prompt templates and the output will be a text embedding
extracted from CLIP’s rich semantic space.
Densifications. CLIP was originally designed for image-
based recognition tasks and does not provide per-pixel out-
puts for dense predictions. Several recent attempts explored
the adaptation from global, image-level recognition to local,
pixel-level prediction, via either model structure modifica-
tion [100] or fine-tuning [51, 71, 97]. The former directly
reformulates the value-embedding layer in CLIP’s image
encoder, while the latter uses semantic labels to gradually
adapt the pre-trained weights to generate dense predictions.
In this work, we implement both solutions to densify CLIP’s
outputs and compare their performances in our experiments.
Up until now, we have presented a preliminary frame-
work capable of conducting open-vocabulary ESS by lever-
aging knowledge from the CLIP model. However, due to
the large domain gap between the event and image modali-
ties, a na ¨ıve adaptation is sub-par in tackling the challenging
event-based semantic scene understanding task.
3.3. F2E: Frame-to-Event Contrastive Distillation
Since our objective is to encourage effective cross-modality
knowledge transfer for holistic event scene perception, itthus becomes crucial to learn meaningful representations
for both thing andstuff classes, especially their boundary
information. However, the sparsity and asynchronous na-
ture of event streams inevitably impede such objectives.
Superpixel-Driven Knowledge Distillation. To pursue a
more informative event representation learning at higher
granularity, we propose to first leverage calibrated frames
to generate coarse, instance-level superpixels and then dis-
till knowledge from a pre-trained image backbone to the
event segmentation network. Superpixel groups pixels into
conceptually meaningful atomic regions, which can be used
as the basis for higher-level perceptions [1, 54, 85]. The
semantically coherent frame-to-event correspondences can
thus be found using pre-processed or online-generated su-
perpixels. Such correspondences tend to bridge the sparse
events to dense frame pixels in a holistic manner without
involving extra training or annotation efforts.
Superpixel & Superevent Generation. We resort to the
following two ways of generating the superpixels. The first
way is to leverage heuristic methods, e.g. SLIC [1], to effi-
ciently groups pixels from frame Iimg
iinto a total of Mslic
segments with good boundary adherence and regularity as
Isp
i={I1
i,I2
i, ...,IMslic
i}, where Mslicis a hyperparame-
ter that needs to be adjusted based on the inputs. The gener-
ated superpixels satisfy I1
i∪I2
i∪...∪IMslic
i ={1,2, ..., H×
W}. For the second option, we use the recent Segment Any-
thing Model (SAM) [49] which takes Iimg
ias the input and
outputs Msamclass-agnostic masks. For simplicity, we use
Mto denote the number of superpixels used during knowl-
edge distillation, i.e.,{Isp
i={I1
i, ...,Ik
i}|k= 1, ..., M }
and show more comparisons between SLIC [1] and SAM
[49] in later sections. Since Ievt
iandIimg
ihave been aligned
and synchronized, we can group events from Ievt
iinto su-
perevents {Vsp
i={V1
i, ...,Vl
i}|l= 1, ..., M }by using the
known event-pixel correspondences.
Frame-to-Event Contrastive Learning. To encourage bet-
ter superpixel-level knowledge transfer, we leverage a pre-
trained image network Fimg
θf:R3×H×W7→RD3×H3×W3
as the teacher and distill information from it to the event
branch Fevt
θe. The parameters of Fimg
θf, which can come
from either CLIP [69] or other pretext task pre-trained back-
bones such as [7, 14, 64], are kept frozen during the distilla-
tion. With Fevt
θeandFimg
θf, we generate the superevent and
superpixel features as follows:

The following contrastive learning objective is applied to

where ⟨·,·⟩denotes the scalar product between the su-
perevent and superpixel embedding; τ1>0is a temperature
coefficient that controls the pace of knowledge transfer.
Role in Our Framework. Our F2E contrastive distillation
establishes an effective pipeline for transferring superpixel-
level knowledge from dense, visual informative frame pix-
els to sparse, irregular event streams. Since we are targeting
the semantic segmentation task, the learned event represen-
tations should be able to reason in terms of instances and
instance parts at and in between semantic boundaries.
3.4. T2E: Text-to-Event Consistency Regularization
Although the aforementioned frame-to-event knowledge
transfer provides a simple yet effective way of transferring
off-the-shelf knowledge from frames to events, the opti-
mization objective might encounter unwanted conflicts.
Intra-Class Optimization Conflict. During the model pre-
training, the superpixel-driven contrastive loss takes the cor-
responding superevent and superpixel pair in a batch as the
positive pair, while treating all remaining pairs as negative
samples. Since heuristic superpixels only provide a coarse
grouping of conceptually coherent segments (kindly refer
to our Appendix for more detailed analysis), it is thus in-
evitable to encounter self-conflict during the optimization.
That is to say, from hindsight, there is a chance that the
superpixels belonging to the same semantic class could be
involved in both positive and negative samples.
Text-Guided Semantic Regularization. To mitigate the
possible self-conflict in Eq. (4), we propose a text-to-event
semantic consistency regularization mechanism that lever-
ages CLIP’s text encoder to generate semantically more
consistent text-frame pairs {Iimg
i, Ti}, where Tidenotes the
text embedding extracted from Ftxt
θt. Such a paired relation-
ship can be leveraged via CLIP without additional training.
We then construct event-text pairs {Ievt
i, Ti}by propagat-
ing the alignment between events and frames. Specifically,
the paired event and text features are extracted as follows:
hevt
i=Qevt
ωq(Fevt
θe(Ievt
i)),htxt
i=Ftxt
θt(Ti),(5)
where Qevt
ωqis a projection layer with trainable parameters
ωq, which is similar to that of Pevt
ωe. Now assume there are
a total of Zclasses in the event dataset, the following objec-
tive is applied to encourage the consistency regularization:LT2E(θe, ωq) = (6)
−ZX
z=1log"P
Ti∈z,Ievt

i,htxt
i⟩/τ2)

j̸=i,Ti∈z,Ti̸∈Ievt
ie(⟨hevt

,(7)
where τ2>0is a temperature coefficient that controls the
pace of knowledge transfer. The overall optimization ob-
jective of our OpenESS framework is to minimize L=
LF2E+αLT2E, where αis a weight balancing coefficient.
Role in Our Framework. Our T2E semantic consistency
regularization provides a global-level alignment to compen-
sate for the possible self-conflict in the superpixel-driven
frame-to-event contrastive learning. As we will show in the
following sections, the two objectives work synergistically
in improving the performance of open-vocabulary ESS.
Inference-Time Configuration. Our OpenESS framework
is designed to pursue segmentation accuracy in annotation-
free and annotation-efficient manners, without sacrificing
event processing efficiency. As can be seen from Fig. 2,
after the cross-modality knowledge transfer, only the event
branch will be kept. This guarantees that there will be no
extra latency or power consumption added during the infer-
ence, which is in line with the practical requirements.
4. Experiments
4.1. Settings
Datasets. We conduct experiments on two popular ESS
datasets. DDD17-Seg [2] is a widely used ESS benchmark
consisting of 40sequences acquired by a DA VIS346B. In
total, 15950 training and 3890 testing events of spatial size
352×200 are used, along with synchronized gray-scale
frames provided by the DA VIS camera. DSEC-Semantic
[78] provides semantic labels for 11sequences in the DSEC
[31] dataset. The training and testing splits contain 8082
and2809 events of spatial size 640×440, accompanied by
color frames (with sensor calibration parameters available)
recorded at 20Hz. More details are in the Appendix.
Benchmark Setup. In addition to the conventional fully-
supervised ESS, we establish two open-vocabulary ESS set-
tings for annotation-free andannotation-efficient learning,
respectively. The former aims to train an ESS model with-
out using any dense event labels, while the latter assumes
an annotation budget of 1%, 5%, 10%, or 20% of events in
the training set. We treat the first few samples from each
sequence as labeled and the remaining ones as unlabeled.
Implementation Details. Our framework is implemented
using PyTorch [66]. Based on the use of event represen-
tations, we form frame2voxel ,frame2recon , and
frame2spike settings, where the event branch will adopt
E2VID [73], ResNet-50 [38], and SpikingFCN [48], respec-
tively, with an AdamW [59] optimizer with cosine learning
rate scheduler. The frame branch uses a pre-trained ResNet-
50 [7, 8, 14] and is kept frozen. The number of superpixels

4.2. Comparative Study
Annotation-Free ESS. In Tab. 1, we compare OpenESS
with MaskCLIP [100] and FC-CLIP [97] in the absence
of event labels. Our approach achieves zero-shot ESS
results of 53.93% and43.31% onDDD17-Seg [2] and
DSEC-Semantic [78], much higher than the two competi-
tors and even comparable to some fully-supervised meth-
ods. This validates the effectiveness of conducting ESS in
an annotation-free manner for practical usage. Meanwhile,
we observe that a fine-tuned CLIP encoder [97] could gen-
erate much better semantic predictions than the structure
adaptation method [100], as mentioned in Sec. 3.2.

previously best-performing methods, OpenESS is 1.63%
and2.21% better in terms of mIoU scores on DDD17-Seg
[2] and DSEC-Semantic [78], respectively. It is worth men-
tioning that in addition to the performance improvements,
our approach can generate open-vocabulary predictions that
are beyond the closed sets of predictions of existing meth-
ods, which is more in line with the practical usage.
Annotation-Efficient Learning. We establish a compre-
hensive benchmark for ESS under limited annotation sce-
narios and show the results in Tab. 3. As can be seen, the
proposed OpenESS contributes significant performance im-
provements over random initialization under linear probing,
few-shot fine-tuning, and fully-supervised learning settings.
Specifically, using either voxel grid or event reconstruction
representation, our approach achieves >30% relative gains
in mIoU on both datasets under liner probing and around
2%higher than prior art in mIoU with full supervisions. We
also observe that using voxel grids to represent raw event
streams tends to yield overall better ESS performance.
Qualitative Assessment. Fig. 4 provides visual compar-
isons between OpenESS and other approaches on DSEC-
Semantic [78]. We find that OpenESS tends to predict more
consistent semantic information from sparse and irregular
event inputs, especially at instance boundaries. We include
more visual examples and failure cases in the Appendix.
Open-World Predictions. One of the core advantages of
OpenESS is the ability to predict beyond the fixed label set
from the original training sets. As shown in Fig. 1, our ap-
proach can take arbitrary text prompts as inputs and gen-
erate semantically coherent event predictions without using
event labels. This is credited to the alignment between event
features and CLIP’s knowledge in T2E. Such a flexible way
of prediction enables a more holistic event understanding.
Other Representation Learning Approaches. In Tab. 2,
we compare OpenESS with recent reconstruction-based [3,

works pre-trained by DINO [8], MoCoV2 [14], or SwA V
[7], the SAM-generated superpixels consistently exhibit
better performance for event representation learning. The
number of superpixels involved in calculating tends to af-
fect the effectiveness of contrastive learning. A preliminary
search to determine this hyperparameter is required. We
empirically find that setting Mto100forDSEC-Semantic
[78] and 25forDDD17-Seg [2] will likely yield the best
possible segmentation performance in our framework.
Cross-Dataset Knowledge Transfer. Since we are target-
ing annotation-free representation learning, it is thus intu-
itive to see the cross-dataset adaptation effect. As shown in
Fig. 5, pre-training on OOD datasets also brings appealing
improvements over the random initialization baseline. This
result highlights the importance of conducting representa-
tion learning for an effective transfer to downstream tasks.

Framework with Event Camera Only. Lastly, we study
the scenario where the frame camera becomes unavailable.
We replace the input to the frame branch with event recon-
structions [73] and show the results in Fig. 6. Since the lim-
ited visual cues from the reconstruction tend to degrade the
quality of representation learning, its performance is sub-
par compared to the frame-based knowledge transfer.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we introduced OpenESS, an open-vocabulary
event-based semantic segmentation framework tailored to
perform open-vocabulary ESS in an annotation-efficient
manner. We proposed to encourage cross-modality repre-
sentation learning between events and frames using frame-
to-event contrastive distillation and text-to-event semantic
consistency regularization. Through extensive experiments,
we validated the effectiveness of OpenESS in tackling dense
event-based predictions. We hope this work could shed light
on the future development of more scalable ESS systems.
