Abstract
Most of the existing Video Anomaly Detection (V AD) studies have been conducted
within single-domain learning, where training and evaluation are performed on a
single dataset. However, the criteria for abnormal events differ across V AD datasets,
making it problematic to apply a single-domain model to other domains. In this
paper, we propose a new task called Multi-Domain learning for V AD (MDV AD ) to
explore various real-world abnormal events using multiple datasets for a general
model. MDV AD involves training on datasets from multiple domains simultane-
ously, and we experimentally observe that Abnormal Conflicts between domains
hinder learning and generalization. The task aims to address two key objectives: (i)
better distinguishing between general normal and abnormal events across multiple
domains, and (ii)being aware of ambiguous abnormal conflicts. This paper is the
first to tackle abnormal conflict issue and introduces a new benchmark, baselines,
and evaluation protocols for MDV AD. As baselines, we propose a framework with
Null(Angular)-Multiple Instance Learning and an Abnormal Conflict classifier.
Through experiments on a MDV AD benchmark composed of six V AD datasets
and using four different evaluation protocols, we reveal abnormal conflicts and
demonstrate that the proposed baseline effectively handles these conflicts, showing
robustness and adaptability across multiple domains.
1 Introduction
Video Anomaly Detection (V AD) is identifying abnormal events in diverse scenarios depicted in a
video and determining their temporal intervals at a frame-level. Nowadays, CCTVs are ubiquitous,
recording every moment of life, which aids in preventing accidents and responding to crimes promptly.
However, human monitoring of every situation is highly inefficient, requiring significant labor and
resources. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to automate V AD through deep
learning by leveraging large amounts of surveillance data [33, 5, 24, 15, 55, 44, 43, 50, 21, 7].
In V AD research, Weakly-supervised V AD (WV AD) [ 55,44,43,50,21,7], which involves learning
normal and abnormal events with minimal supervision of the video-level annotation and detecting
abnormal events at the frame-level during testing, has been studied a lot recently. This paper focuses
on the WV AD setting (denoted as V AD), and a summary of V AD research is explained in the
∗Work done while doing an internship at NA VER Cloud.

supplementary material (§ E). Unlike the conventional V AD research, we first address the following
three key questions:
Q1: What is the problem with the existing VAD model? Most V AD models are trained in a single-
domain where the training and evaluation dataset are the same. In the case of single-domain learning,
application across different datasets (cross-domain evaluation) results in performance degradation
as reported in [ 14,6,7] because V AD models are heavily influenced by the criteria for abnormality
defined by each dataset.
Q2: Why do we need a general VAD model? First, a single generalized model removes the need
for multiple specific models for different domains, analogous to multi-task learning. Second, proper
pre-training on multiple domains embodies generalized representation, and it can discriminate
abnormal events according to their domain, leading to better performance in unseen target domains.
Consequently, a general V AD model will be highly beneficial for applying V AD in practical scenarios.
Q3: Is it possible to create a general VAD model? The general V AD model aims to handle multiple
domains, but this is challenging because the definition of abnormal differs for each dataset, leading
to conflicts between these abnormal events. For example, as shown in Fig. 1(a), in one dataset, a
pedestrian on the road is considered normal, while in another dataset, it is deemed abnormal. A
general V AD cannot be solved with a naive muti-task learning because of this confusion across
multiple domains, which this paper defines as ‘Abnormal Conflict.’ Therefore, for general V AD, it
is necessary to be aware of these abnormal conflicts (yellow region in Fig. 1(b)) and learn general
normal (green region in Fig. 1(b)) or abnormal (red region in Fig. 1(b)) representations that are
common across all domains.
Our goal is to construct a general V AD model by conducting multi-domain learning while recogniz-
ingabnormal conflicts and exploring representations of general normality and abnormality . To
achieve this goal, we introduce a new task called 1) Multiple Domain V AD (MDV AD), along with
a benchmark and new evaluation protocols. MDV AD involves concurrent training on multiple
V AD datasets, each with its own definition of abnormality. Specifically, the MDV AD benchmark
comprises six representative V AD datasets with balanced sampling (§ 4.1). We also propose four
evaluation protocols: held-in, leave-one-out, low-shot domain adaptation, and full fine-tuning. The
held-in protocol is designed to evaluate the model’s ability as a unified model like multi-task model,
while the leave-one-out, low-shot domain adaptation, and full fine-tuning protocols are intended to
access the model’s capability as a general pre-training for an unseen target domain.
As multi-domain learning is a novel concept in the field of V AD, we also introduce baselines and
new learning methods. We design domain-specific multiple heads to mitigate abnormal conflicts and
learn generality across domains. To facilitate multi-head learning without conflicts, we propose the
2) Null-Multiple Instance Learning (Null-MIL) and NullAngular-MIL (NullAng-MIL) losses ,
which activate only the output of the head corresponding to the input domain, assigning inactive
heads with Null values to prevent confusion. Additionally, we suggest the 3) Abnormal Conflict
(AC) Classifier to explore general features while being aware of abnormal conflicts , leveraging
the variance in abnormal scores across the multiple heads (Fig. 2 green and yellow region in the
Venn diagram). Through experiments with four protocols on the MDV AD benchmark, we reveal the
limitations of multi-domain learning with abnormal conflict and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
baselines in offering a generalized and adaptive model.
21.1 Scope of research
Focusing on Multiple Domains. In this paper, we focus on solving the problems in multiple domains
introduced above rather than solving problems in a single domain. Therefore, complex design of
the backbone and head or achieving state-of-the-art performance in a single domain can proceed
orthogonally with our research. Instead, this paper raises the issue of abnormal conflict and focuses
on the necessity of MDV AD.
Distinction from Open-set V AD Approaches. Unlike Open-set V AD [ 59,25,1], which separates
seen and unseen anomalies within a single-domain cannot achieve robust representation learning
among multiple domains, this paper excels at handling abnormal conflicts and shows adaptability
across domains with versatile evaluation protocols (held-in/out and low-shot).
2 Observations
2.1 Datasets
In this paper, we use six representative V AD datasets: UCF-Crimes (UCFC) [ 43], XD-Violences
(XD) [ 51], Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) [ 47], UBI-Fights (UBIF) [ 9], Traffic Anomaly
Dataset (TAD) [ 19], and Shanghai-Tech Campus (ST) [ 24]. As shown in Table 1, each dataset has
different environments ( e.g.CCTV , Traffic, Campus), quantities, and abnormal categories. Unlike
other datasets, ST is an unsupervised V AD benchmark whose training set comprises only normal
videos, so the training set has been reorganized following [21, 45, 57]. More details are provided in
the supplementary material (Sec. A).
2.2 Analysis
Based on observations of each dataset’s properties, we aim to quantify how the different properties
negatively affect domain shifts. Table 2 presents cross-domain evaluation results, i.e., single-domain
models validated on different target datasets. The results reveal that while these models excel in-
domain settings (diagonal elements of the table), they exhibit significant performance degradation in
cross-domain scenarios. This implies that a single-domain V AD model may be ineffective in most
other environments unless the environment and user’s intention are precisely identical. Therefore,
leveraging diverse datasets for generalized feature learning is crucial, enabling the model to handle
unknown domain and well adapted to unseen anomalies. This paper addresses two primary issues:
1) Abnormal conflict arising during the multi-domain learning process, and 2) Scene discrepancy
occurring during the evaluation process on an unseen target domain.
Abnormal conflict. As illustrated in Fig. 1, abnormal conflicts indicate abnormal events that are
considered abnormal in one (or some) domain(s) but are denoted as normal in other domains. As

shown in Table 1, there is relatively little overlap of abnormal classes in ST with other datasets.
In other words, this means that the abnormal conflict with other datasets is relatively large. This
conflict leads to low cross-dataset performances of models trained or evaluated on ST in Table 2.
Taking UCFC as an example (target domain: UCFC column in Table 2), performance increases in the
order of TAD, ST, LAD, XD, and UBIF, which is proportional to the number of abnormal conflict
categories that exist in the source domain. Abnormal conflict makes the MDV AD unique as the label
spaces between domains literally conflict because of each other’s differing definitions.
Scene discrepancy. Scene discrepancy refers to differences in the visual settings of scenes, distinct
from abnormal conflict arising from variations in the definition of abnormal classes. To quantify
scene discrepancy, we utilize the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) [ 38] introduced in [ 8] to calculate
the distance between V AD datasets in the Table 3. In Table 3, the top-right section illustrates the
comparison of normal features, while the bottom-left provides a numerical comparison of class-wise
abnormal features. Lighter colors indicate a higher discrepancy between datasets. Unlike other
datasets, TAD, which comprises traffic videos, exhibits a large distance from normal sample distances
in the dataset, while LAD, with diverse and complex scenes for abnormal classes, shows the furthest
distance from other datasets. This explains the results of domain adaptation experiments. (Table 7).
3 Baselines
Fig. 2 depicts the overall framework of our MDV AD baselines divided into domain-agnostic layers,
consisting of the video backbone and aggregation modules, Single (§ 3.1) or Multiple heads (§ 3.2),
and AC classifier (§ 3.3).
Domain-agnostic layers. The input abnormal or normal video VaorVnis divided into uniformly
sampled Tsnippets ( Va∈ {va
1,···,va
T}). These Tsnippets pass through a pre-trained video
backbone, resulting in a C-dimensional feature B∈RT×Cthat undergoes an aggregation module,
fusing them from the feature level to the temporal level. The feature aggregation layer doubles the
channel size ˆB∈RT×2C, followed by a split and max operation Fagg,i = maxh
ˆBc
i,ˆBC+c
ii
c=1,···,C
to squeeze the channel size back to Cfor the i-th snippet. Activating only the maximum element
during gradient propagation enables the implicit differentiation of class-specific channels, allowing
the model to establish discrepancies between classes [ 7,52]. The temporal aggregation layer, with a
temporal kernel size of 3, produces the domain-agnostic aggregated feature FDA∈RT×C/2.
43.1 Single-domain learning
The final feature FDAundergoes fully connected layers denoted as FCand the single abnormal head
(wa
D1∈RC/16×1) followed by a sigmoid function to derive the final abnormal score sa
D1∈RT×1.
MIL. Due to the absence of temporal interval training labels for abnormal events, WV AD models rely
on video-level labels for training, employing the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) method. When
the top- Kscore set is represented as Ωk(sa
D1), the Binary Cross Entropy-based (BCE) classification
loss function is formulated as presented in Eq. 1, where y={0,1}.
LMIL =X
i∈Ωk(sa
D1)−(ylogsa
D1,i+ (1−y)log(1−sa
D1,i)), (1)
This loss function ensures that only snippets with high (Top- K) abnormal scores can contribute to
the loss. This single-head model serves as the single-domain baseline (MIL in Fig. 2).
3.2 Multi-domain learning: Multi-head learning
Null-MIL. To address the abnormal conflict issue mentioned in Sec. 2, in the MDV AD framework,
the abnormal head is divided into multiple heads, each responsible for its own domain, allowing for
the domain-wise prediction of the output score. Inspired by [ 18], the prediction score for the input
snippet from the Dddataset is derived exclusively from the output of the Dd-head, and the results
from heads of other datasets are filled with Null values (Null-MIL in Fig. 2). Compared to Eq. 1, the
Null-MIL loss is changed as follows:
LNull−MIL =MX
d=1X
i∈Ωk(sa
Dd)−(ylogsa
D1,i+ (1−y)log(1−sa
D1,i)) (2)
where Mis the number of heads (domains). To avoid the abnormal conflicts, the heads between
datasets are separated where Dd-head’s weight wa
Ddis independently trained for the corresponding
dataset. In Eq. 2, only sa
Ddamong all output scores is added to the loss, thus the gradient becomes
∂sa
Dd
∂wa
Dd, while other heads are not affected.
For the test, the abnormal score of i-th snippet is sa
Dd,iwhen the target dataset is Ddandmax dsa
Dd,i
by selecting the maximum value for unseen target data.
NullAng-MIL. We additionally propose a NullAngular-based MIL method that employs the angular
margin to effectively diminish large variations among intra-class instances. In this case, multiple
normal heads are added (NullAng-MIL in Fig. 2). When head classifier weight of each dataset
Ddis denoted as wa

Ddand final embedding feature is F, the final abnormal and normal
scores are represented by sa
Dd=F·wa

When the source domain of the pre-trained general model is different from the target domain, we
determine the final score to reflect conflicts by taking the maximum normal and abnormal score from
multiple heads.
Unseen domain adaptation. After multi-domain learning, when a new target dataset or unseen
condition appears, the final score is computed based on the similarity between the embedding feature
of the input video and each source domain’s head classifier. Therefore, it operates by considering
domain similarity, which can address the performance degradation issue that occurs due to the scene
discrepancy discussed in Sec. 2.
Complexity. Only the final layer is added based on the number of datasets, with the head’s weight
denoted as wDd∈RT×1, which is a very small proportion of the entire model. Comparing a single
and multiple heads (6 datasets), the training times are 2.68 and 2.81 hours, and the inference times are
0.158 and 0.164 milliseconds per snippet, respectively, indicating a negligible increase in complexity.
3.3 Abnormal Conflict (AC) classifier
In the domain-agnostic feature extraction phase, it is crucial to capture general features that can
handle every domain. While we have divided the heads to avoid abnormal conflicts in multiple source
datasets, the agnostic part extracts features from all datasets using a single branch, and inconsistent
labels cause confusion. Therefore, we propose an Abnormal Conflict (AC) classifier for learning the
final embedding feature FDAthat passes through the detector heads.
In Fig. 2, each classifier head distinguishes between DdandDdc, while the AC classifier is intended
to distinguish between elements that are abnormal or normal across all source datasets (green area)
and elements that represent conflicts (yellow area) within the Venn diagram. The AC classifier takes
the embedding feature FDAas input, followed by two FClayers, to predict the final conflict score
sAC. In Eq. 6, the AC label is generated based on the scores of all abnormal heads, where yAC
i= 1
if the deviation between the scores is above a threshold τ.

The total objective function is L=LNullAng −MIL+λLAC.
During the testing phase, the auxiliary branch AC classifier is eliminated, and the output is calculated
for each input snippet vias the final Abnormal Score i.
4 Experimental Results
4.1 MDV AD benchmark
As shown in Table 1, V AD comprises six representative datasets with diverse settings and volumes.
The MDV AD is a task aimed at addressing domain shifts between datasets, and each dataset included
in the MDV AD benchmark should be structured so that it is not biased toward any particular dataset
or anomalies. Consequently, datasets should have an equal volume in the training set and encompass
various abnormal categories and criteria. To achieve this, we sampled each dataset to align with
the dataset with the smallest volume, ensuring that each abnormal category has a similar proportion

Column-wise coloring with increased intensity for higher values
and conducted 3-fold experiments. Additionally, to handle small datasets like TAD and ST, which
have minimal volumes, we combined them with the traffic dataset CADP [ 41] and campus dataset
NWPU [ 3], respectively, by reorganizing their training sets. The volume of MDV AD benchmark is
unified at 386 videos per dataset. More details provided in the supplementary material (Sec. B).
4.2 Empirical studies
This section presents empirical studies as follows: first, single-domain results for comparison,
followed by the results of four evaluation protocols for the MDV AD benchmark. The models are
trained on the training set of the source domain and evaluated on the test set of the target domain under
the following settings: Held-in (E1), Leave-one-out (E2), Low-shot adaptation (E3), and Full fine-
tuning (E4). The Area Under Curve (AUC) is used as the evaluation metric. The hyper-parameters
areT= 32 ,λ= 10 ,τ= 0.3, andm= 0.3. Since the single-head baseline cannot assign AC labels
using Eq. 6, pseudo-labels for the AC classifier are assigned based on the range of predicted abnormal
scores. All detailed implementations, more results, and discussions are provided in the supplementary
material.
Single-domain results. In the preliminary experiment, we examine the performance of the MDV AD
benchmark under single-source and single-target conditions using a single-head MIL baseline.
Comparing the in-domain (diagonal elements) results in Table 2 (using the original training set) and
Table 4 (using the sampled training set), we observe that the performance diminishes when datasets,
other than TAD and ST, are reduced during sampling. Conversely, TAD and ST show improved
performance, benefiting from increased diversity and data volume due to reorganization with CADP
and NWPU for TAD and ST, respectively. The cross-domain (off-diagonal elements) results in
Table 4 demonstrate consistent trends with both the MDV AD and V AD benchmarks. These trends
primarily arise from challenges related to abnormal conflict and scene discrepancies, indicating that
the issues are confined to in-domain settings. Consequently, to uphold in-domain performance across
diverse datasets and effectively address issues related to abnormal conflict and scene discrepancies,
we emphasize the essential role of multi-domain learning in developing a general model for V AD.
4.2.1 Held-in results (E1)
In this section, we discuss the held-in evaluation results, where models are trained on all datasets
of MDV AD, and the test set of each source dataset is used as the target. Table 5 presents the results
obtained by training with the MIL baseline with a single-head, which is commonly used in traditional
WV AD, and the proposed Null(Ang)-MIL baseline composed of multiple heads. Because UCFC, XD,
and LAD exhibit low abnormal conflicts, numerous similarities in abnormal categories, and minimal
scene discrepancy, there are great performances with the single-head MIL baseline. However, when
TAD and ST are targets, the results demonstrate that the Null(Ang)-MIL baselines, which extract
general domain features in the domain-agnostic part and avoid conflict by assigning Null values with
multiple heads, outperform the MIL baseline.
Handling multi-domain with a single Null(Ang)-MIL baseline. The average performance of
single Null-MIL and NullAng-MIL is comparable to or even better than the average performance
of individual in-domain models trained for each domain (86.52%). Moreover, the NullAng-MIL
baseline, which effectively performs inter/intra-class learning through cosine angular margin while
avoiding conflict between each head, achieves superior results, with 91.82% (TAD) and 91.26%
(ST) compared to the performances of single in-domain results of 90.75% (TAD) and 90.79% (ST),

highlighting the effectiveness of learning with diverse and abundant data to enhance model generality.
Furthermore, additional performance boosts are observed across all baselines with the auxiliary AC
classifier to make the model conflict-aware.
4.2.2 Leave-one-out results (E2)
The E2 experiments, in Table 6, are conducted on the leave-one-out setting among multiple source
datasets and evaluated on the unseen target dataset unlike E1. Each column represents the outcomes
of models trained with the target dataset excluded. Compared with the held-in results, the evaluation
results conducted without prior knowledge of abnormal boundaries for unseen target data lead
performance gap between E1 and E2.
Effectiveness of multi-domain learning for unseen target domain. When comparing single-domain
learning and multi-domain learning in the results of unseen target evaluation (Out Avg. in Table 6), it
is evident that the performance with multiple datasets is significantly superior. Effectively addressing
conflict and discrepancy issues, and learning from diverse and complex situations across multiple
domains, leads to the development of a general model with better performance on unseen domains.
4.2.3 Low-shot adaptation results (E3)
In E3, we delve into low-shot learning, examining how well the model trained with multiple sources
in the leave-one-out experiments (E2) adapts to unseen targets. In this experiment, we utilized 10% of
the target training set for low-shot learning (in a 3-fold setting). For datasets with abnormal categories,
an equal number of data per category are randomly sampled, while for uncategorized datasets like
UBIF and ST, random sampling is employed.
Importance of general pre-trained baselines for adaptation. In Table 7, comparing with Table 6,
notable performance improvements are observed across all baselines for target samples with severe
domain conflicts and gaps, such as UBIF, TAD, and ST, even with a limited volume of training
samples. This emphasizes the importance of building a general model to adapt on unforeseen targets.
While the MIL baseline with a single head holds an advantage in adapting specific single head
when target samples are appropriately selected, it may become dependent on specific samples and is
susceptible to overfitting. On the other hand, NullAng-MIL, with conflict-aware learning and training
on diverse domains, outperforms other methods in adaptation performance.

When evaluating multi-domain baselines trained on
all datasets in the held-in (E1) setting, it demonstrates
performance comparable to single-domain models that
perform well by fitting to a single dataset. However,
after full fine-tuning on the target dataset, the E1 model
achieves superior performance in most cases. The E1

and E2 models, which are well-explored across multiple domains, outperform the models specifically
trained on a single domain after full fine-tuning.
4.2.5 Summary
Null-MIL and NullAng-MIL. The Null-MIL baseline achieves the best performance (86.86%) in the
Held-in setting (E1), even surpassing the in-domain average results (86.52%). However, in the Leave-
one-out setting (E2), which involves unknown target domains, it shows suboptimal performance.
This is because it is impossible to determine which head’s output score among the source dataset
heads is more reliable, so multiple head baselines employ the maximum score for unknown domains.
Conversely, NullAng-MIL exhibits superior results in E2 due to its similarity-based score calculation.
NullAng-MIL considers the cosine distance between the final feature and the weights of each source
head. As a result, when calculating the final score, the head with high similarity to the target data is
activated, yielding promising results. When pre-training the general V AD model without knowledge
of the target, we observed that utilizing the NullAng-MIL baseline is beneficial. However, when
conducting multi-domain learning with knowledge of the target, employing Null-MIL yields better
results. We observed that when pre-training the general V AD model without prior knowledge of the
target, utilizing the NullAng-MIL baseline proves beneficial and employing Null-MIL yields better
results when knowledge of the target is available during multi-domain learning.
Role of the AC Classifier. In multi-domain learning, the proposed AC classifier serves as an auxiliary
branch designed to predict whether there is an abnormal conflict between domains, thus making the
model aware of conflicts. Since it is not used during testing, it does not impact the final model’s cost
but provides performance gains in most experiments. Notably, in E2 and E3, training with the AC
classifier shows a significant boost effect, aiding in adaptation to unseen domains.

open-set scenario using UBNormal (UBN) dataset [ 1].
The UBN is a V AD benchmark proposed for open-
set scenarios to handle unexpected abnormal events.
Both normal and abnormal events are available during
training, but the anomalies that occur during inference
belong to a distinct set of anomaly types (categories).
Unlike other V AD datasets, UBN consists of synthetic
videos to alleviate the difficulty of collecting abnormal
event data in the real world. There are substantial ab-
normal conflicts and differences in the visual settings
of scenes compared to other domains. For multi-domain learning, we reorganized the training/ testing
set of UBN to maintain the same number of normal and abnormal videos in the training set with
MDV AD, which is uniformly sampled and balanced the same amount of videos from all domains. As
9shown in Table 9, despite domain discrepancies and abnormal conflict, the model effectively handles
multiple domain learning, demonstrating that general feature learning can adequately address unseen
abnormal categories. Please refer to §. A5 for more details.

this paper focuses on the analysis of multiple
domain learning within the context of abnormal
conflict issues, instead of exploring complex
architecture designs for single-domain V AD
models, we compare with various V AD mod-
els. Table 10 presents the results of other MIL-
based WV AD models, MMIL [ 43], ARNet [ 46],
WSAL [ 30], and COMO [ 7] on the MDV AD
task. Compared to the proposed baseline trained
with the AC classifier, our method achieves the
highest average AUC, particularly in datasets
with severe abnormal conflicts and scene dis-
crepancies, such as TAD and ST, in both the
E2 and even more in the E3 settings. Various
single-domain V AD models or backbones can
be incorporated into the MDV AD task, show-
ing a direction for future generalization work.
Please refer to § A6.
AC classifier. The AC classifier helps the
model learn conflict-aware features, providing
a clearer understanding of abnormalities. The
proposed framework is composed of Domain-
Agnostic Layers that learn general features across multiple domains, followed by Multiple Heads
that predict abnormalities specific to each domain. When the Domain-Agnostic layers learn to
perform AC classification, they capture whether the input snippets relate to abnormal conflict or not.
From the Heads’ perspective, these features are separated into abnormal conflict and non-AC in the
feature space, allowing the Heads to apply different criteria (decision boundaries) when distinguishing
between normal and abnormal instances. For example, in classifying abnormalities, non-AC scenarios
can be addressed more straightforwardly, while abnormal conflict scenarios require a more careful
exploration. Fig. 3(a) presents the results of the AC classifier of NullAng-MIL baseline from E1. It
shows abnormal conflict scores for two scenarios: (Top) A car on the Sidewalk abnormal event in ST,
which is normal in the UCFC. (Bottom) A normal situation of people shopping in a grocery store.
Through the multi-domain learning, the AC classifier outputs a high abnormal conflict score for the
top sample, demonstrating that the model has learned to be conflict-aware.
Qualitative results. Fig. 3(b) illustrates abnormal conflict scene: (Top) Bicyclist on Walkway ,
abnormal in ST but normal in other domains, and (Bottom) Pedestrian on Road , abnormal in TAD but
normal in UCFC. In these scenarios, the MIL baseline trained with multiple domains predicts (Top)
false negative and (Bottom) false positive, while ours adaptively handles conflicts across different
domains.
5 Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Works
In this paper, we propose a new task called MDV AD, whose ultimate goal is to effectively learn from
multiple domains with different data distributions and definitions of abnormality without confusion,
resulting in a general V AD model. As a baseline, we propose a new multi-head framework with
Null(Ang)-MIL loss and AC classifier. These modules effectively handle abnormal conflicts between
domains and show meaningful results in the MDV AD benchmark with diverse evaluation protocols.
Instead of exploring complex architecture design of single-domain V AD models, this paper focuses
on resolving abnormal conflicts from multiple domains. Various single-domain V AD models or
backbones can be applied into our novel framework to address the MDV AD task, representing a
valuable direction for future generalization research.

Terminology
•Domain/ Dataset: In this paper, ’domain’ refers to the broader context or environment,
while ’dataset’ refers to the specific collection of data used within that domain.
•Single-domain: Training and evaluation data are the same, as in traditional V AD research.
•Multi-domain Learning/ General V AD: General V AD is the objective of detecting anoma-
lies across various domains, while Multi-domain Learning is the method used to achieve
this by training on multiple domains.
•Multi-head Learning: The baseline method proposed in this paper for Multi-domain
Learning.
•Multi-task Learning: Performing multiple tasks with a single model, related to E1 by
integrating various domain’s anomalies into one framework.
•General Pre-training: A methodology of pre-training on large data without target knowl-
edge, related to E2 by training in a held-out setting and applying to an unseen target.
Furthermore, general pre-trained models adapt well to low-shot learning in E3 and fine-
tuning in E4.
A V AD Datasets
As mentioned in §2, the V AD task encompasses diverse datasets, as delineated in Table A1.
UCFC [ 43], the prominent large-scale dataset for the Weakly-Supervised approach, consists of
untrimmed surveillance videos. It categorizes anomalies into 13 classes related to public safety,

ranging from crimes such as abuse and arson to more complicated scenarios like stealing and
shoplifting. The dataset consists of a total of 950 normal and abnormal videos each, with the training
set maintaining a balanced distribution of 800 and 810 samples for normal and abnormal videos,
respectively.
The XD dataset [ 51] stands out as the most extensive dataset with a variety of environments, including
CCTV , movies, hand-held cameras, and car camera settings. It incorporates six categories of violence,
such as abuse, riot, and explosion, defining anomalies. Within the dataset of 4,754 videos, there are
2,049 normal and 1,905 abnormal training videos.
The LAD dataset [ 47] is defined by a detailed categorization of 14 anomaly classes, including crash,
fire, and violence, consisting of 2,000 videos, with 958 normal and 482 abnormal videos.
The UBIF dataset [ 9] is composed of various fighting-related anomalies extracted from our daily life
videos. This dataset consists of 1,000 videos without a specific categorization for the fighting class,
and the training set consists of 757 normal and 176 abnormal videos, leading class imbalance issue.
The TAD dataset [ 19] is structured with traffic surveillance and 1st-person videos, encompassing
anomalies related to traffic, such as accidents, illegal turns, and road spills. This dataset, totaling 500
videos, has a small volume with 210 and 190 numbers of normal and abnormal training videos.
The ST [ 24] serves as a campus surveillance dataset, capturing anomalies occurring on pedestrian
walkways. It exhibits a heightened sensitivity to abnormal events, ranging from fighting and throwing
to running and jumping. With only 175 normal and 63 abnormal videos in the training set out of a total
of 437 videos, there is a notable imbalance between classes, and the quantity of data is insufficient
for learning. Abnormal categories in the training set cover all anomalies in the testing set on each
dataset except for ST (ST remains indeterminate because of the absence of category information),
which means evaluations are exclusively conducted for seen abnormal events.
Examining the dataset samples in Table A1 reveals that TAD and ST exhibit a visual gap compared
to the other datasets, UCFC, XD, and LAD. Such gap is attributed to visual elements such as scene
settings and conditions that impact the visual characteristics of scenes, which is the scene discrepancy
discussed in §2. While LAD (some videos) and ST are recorded in square or campus settings to
establish real-world scenario datasets, the remaining datasets are constructed online, such as YouTube
and LiveLeak using text search queries. These datasets also exhibit a significant domain distance, as
indicated in Table 3. As such, the criteria for defining abnormalities and the visual characteristics of
scenes vary across different datasets.
B MDV AD Benchmarks
B.1 Configuration
The five datasets introduced in Table A1 have different training set volumes, leading to challenges
in handling multiple dataset learning, where larger datasets may overwhelm the learning process.
16For instance, there is a significant disparity in training set volumes, with TAD (400 videos), ST (238
videos), and XD (3954 videos) differing by almost 10 times. Additionally, the number of abnormal
videos in XD differs roughly 10 and 30 times compared to TAD and ST, respectively.
The objective of the MDV AD task is to avoid abnormal conflict and build a general model through
balanced learning across diverse situations and anomalies. To control for other variables, we uniformly
sampled andbalanced the same amount of videos from all domains, equal to the number of videos
in the smallest domain. Since TAD and ST have an insufficient number of videos for training, we
recombine them with two new datasets, CADP [ 41] and NWPU [ 3], respectively, to balance the
numbers. CADP is a dataset for traffic accident analysis, and it shares similarities with TAD in
terms of setting and abnormal definition. Hence, following the approach in [ 28], we compose TAD’s
training set by adding abnormal videos from CADP. Additionally, incorporating the recently released
NWPU dataset, which collects various anomalies of pedestrians on campus, we augment ST’s dataset
with NWPU data. For both datasets, we conducted random sampling for normal and abnormal videos,
considering the smallest sample size, resulting in a number of 210 normal and 176 abnormal videos.
In this process, for datasets with information on abnormal classes, we compose to achieve a uniform
number of instances per abnormal category on each dataset. For datasets with a sufficient amount, we
organize 3-fold sets to minimize overlap. All reported performance metrics are the average results
of evaluations conducted on the target dataset after training on each fold. For example, in the E2
leave-one-out setting, the average results are derived from models trained on each fold and evaluated
on an E3 low-shot adaptation set for the corresponding fold.
The MDV AD benchmark incorporates the datasets introduced in Table A1, including abnormal
categories: Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Accident, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, Robbery, Shooting,
Stealing, Shoplifting, Vandalism, Drop, Hurt, Fall Into Water, Falling, Destroy, Fire, Violence, Crowd,
Thiefing, Panic, Loitering, Trampled, Illegal Turns, Illegal Occupations, Retrograde Motion, Traffic
Else, Pedestrian on Road, Road Spills, and Campus Else . The circular chart in Fig. A4(a) illustrates
the distribution of categories. For datasets without abnormal categories like ST (named as Campus
Else), TAD (where additional categories are labeled as Traffic Else ), and UBIF (where categorization
is not specified and all fall under Fighting ), we provide appropriate category names. The averages
across the 3-folds are calculated, and in the case of XD with multiple labels per video, we count the
number of categories per video. The Fighting predominates in the majority of datasets, occupying the
largest portion, followed by categories like Accident ,Explosion , and others.
B.2 Experimental settings
V AD is predominantly evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score based on abnormal
scores, focusing on the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, emphasizing the false positive
rate (FPR). While XD employs the Average Precision (AP) metric to balance precision and recall and
concentrate on positive samples for direct comparison in cross-dataset and held-in/out evaluations,
and emphasizing False Positive Rate (FPR) (detailed explanation is in Section D), we utilize the AUC
score across all evaluations.
The MDV AD benchmark comprises four protocols: Held-in (E1) involves multiple-source learning
with all datasets, Leave-one-out (E2) employs a leave-one-out approach where a dataset left out during
training is used for evaluation, low-shot adapation learning (E3) is training on the remaining datasets,
and Full fine-tuning (E4) that fine-tunes a multi-domain models on single-domain datasets. In the E3
setting, around 10% of the training set, 20 videos, is randomly sampled for low-shot examples. For
datasets with anomaly category information, low-shot examples are selected uniformly to ensure an
even distribution within each category. To mitigate the impact of randomness, the low-shot setting is
also conducted with 3-fold cross-validation, obtaining low-shot examples from each fold. In all cases,
including MIL, Null-MIL, and NullAng-MIL models, all weights except for the pretrained backbone
are updated. Additionally, for abnormal videos, the score from the AC classifier is multiplied to the
loss value.
C Implementation Details
All experiments are conducted on the MDV AD benchmark. We use I3D backbone feature which is
pretrained on Kinetics dataset [ 4] with C= 2048 dimension of RGB features. During the training
phase, we conduct consistent experiments with a batch size of 32, utilizing the Adam optimizer [ 20]
17with a learning rate of 5e−5and weight decay of 5e−4. The input image size is set to 224×224
and following [ 21,31,45,7], we perform 10-crop augmentation when extracting backbone features.
The backbone is used the same as RTFM [ 45] and CoMo [ 7]. For input data, 16 frames are stacked
for a snippet, and Tsnippets are uniformly sampled in the video during training. For testing, all
snippets pass through the model, and the output score is assigned to all frames within the snippet. For
MIL learning, the Top- Ksnippets, where Kequals 10% of the total, i.e.,K= 3, are utilized. In the
case of a single-headed MIL model in Table 5 (E1) setting, since pseudo-labels cannot be generated
through multiple heads, the AC classifier is trained with a label that yAC= 1for a score sa
D1within
the[0.4,0.7]range. When computing EMD metric in §2, we use a pretrained I3D backbone model
for extract embedding features of each dataset and measure the distance between feature vectors.
We use a test set with frame-level annotations for abnormalities. All models and experiments are
implemented and evaluated end-to-end using PyTorch [34] with a single NVIDIA V100 GPU.
In weakly-supervised V AD, maintaining class balance is pivotal, so the number of normal and
abnormal input videos within a batch is kept equal for the MIL-based learning. Similarly, during
multiple source learning, an equal number of input videos from each source domain within a batch is
crucial. Despite each head is trained independently, the final feature FDAis extracted from a shared
domain-agnostic part, necessitating the balance in the number of source domains. Moreover, when
training the AC classifier, in order to address the imbalance between the number of abnormal conflict
snippets and all normal/abnormal snippets, we apply focal loss [ 23] toLAC. During the testing phase,
the AC classifier is eliminated, and the output is calculated for each input snippet vias the final

Table A4 provides information about the layers of the baseline model. Conv1d ,fc,Max,BN, and
DOrepresent 1D convolutional layer, fully connected layer, element-wise max activation, 1D batch
normalization [ 16], and dropout [ 42], respectively, with a dropout probability set to p= 0.7. In
Conv1d (c, k, s )andfc(c),c,k, andsdenote the channel size, kernel size, and stride size, respectively.
Tinput snippets pass through the backbone, resulting in a backbone feature Bwith a shape of
(N, T, C ), where Nrepresents the batch size. The feature aggregation layer undergoes channel
doubling followed by channel squeezing with element-wise max operation, resulting in an output
feature Faggwith a shape of (N, T, C ). Subsequently, the temporal aggregation layer outputs FDA
with a shape of (N, T, C/ 2). These embeddings are then input into the AC classifier and fclayer.The
AC classifier, composed of consecutive fclayers, outputs AC scores sACfor each snippet with a
shape of (N, T, 1). Additionally, the final feature F, processed through an fclayer, is input into
multiple domain heads wDdfor NullAng-MIL learning. During this process, both the feature and
weights are normalized with respect to ∥F∥and∥wDd∥for each domain.

While cross-domain evaluation in Table 2 reveals a domain gap, it is difficult to attribute as abnormal
conflicts directly. In Table A2, we calculate the average of the relative False Positive Rate (FPR) and
relative False Negative Rate (FNR) to quantify the abnormal conflict between domains.
ACi,j=(FPR i,j−FPR j,j) + (FNR i,j−FNR j,j)

where iandjindicate source and target domain, repectively. First, FPR and FNR refer to the rate of
misclassifying abnormal as normal and normal as abnormal in the scenario of learning from a source
and testing on a target, respectively. However, since these include the FPR and FNR caused by the
incompleteness of the model itself, this cannot accurately reflect the abnormal conflict between the
source and target dataset. Therefore, we subtract the FPR and FNR when the source domain is the
same as the target domain ( FPR j,jandFNR j,j) from the cross-domain FPR and FNR to calculate
the relative FPR and FNR caused by the domain shift. Table A2 shows similar trends compared to
Table 2, where values are not normalized. This shows that abnormal conflicts between domains are
relevant to the reduction in generalization ability that can occur when transferring between domains.
E Related Works
As mentioned, proposing a new V AD model is beyond the scope of this paper, this part is organized
to aid understanding.
Unsupervised V AD Defining anomalies precisely is challenging as they can vary based on criteria
and sensitivity, and it is impossible to categorize and collect datasets for every scenario. For this
reason, Unsupervised V AD methods [ 33,5,24,15] have been developed to learn normal patterns
using only normal training data and then detect anomalies as scenes with low normality during
the test phase. However, this approach leads to a significant bias towards the normal samples,
causing the detector to misclassify normal patterns that differ from the learned data as abnormal
events, resulting in a high false alarm rate. To address this issue, Weakly-supervised V AD (WV AD)
approaches [ 55,44,43,50,21,7] have been introduced to differentiate between normal and abnormal
events with minimal supervision using video-level annotations, achieving significant performance
improvements while incurring lower labeling costs compared to frame-level annotations.
Weakly-supervised V AD MMIL [ 43] is the first WV AD method to pose the MIL ranking approach
as a regression problem that achieves significant performance gains. Various learning methods,
including magnitude feature learning [ 45], self-training approaches through pseudo labels [ 13,21],
and distance learning [ 53], have been explored alongside traditional MIL methods. Furthermore,
subsequent approaches have focused on capturing features by focusing temporal or motion informa-
tion [ 58], leveraging additional audio signals [ 51], learning relations between temporal [ 50] or motion
and context information [ 7]. These methods differentiate complex anomalies through contextual
information; for example, the same motion may be classified as normal or abnormal depending on the
surrounding environment. PFMP [ 26] proposed a method to utilize virtual data anomalies to reduce
scene discrepancy with real-world data, addressing the issue of data scarcity in V AD. However, these
approaches still cannot address abnormal conflicts, where the same situation is labeled differently as
abnormal or normal based on the criteria of different datasets.
Generalization for V AD A few studies have been conducted to generalize V AD. Domain adaptation
refers to evaluating a new domain that was not seen during training, and some works have proposed
using some data from the target domain [ 27,29] or not using it at all [ 2]. We also experiment
with domain adaptation, but the difference is that we use multiple domains compared to existing
studies that only use a single domain during training. Open-set recognition aims to work well even
in untrained classes (abnormal categories in V AD). Compared to our research involving multiple
domains, Open-set V AD [59, 1] focuses on learning and evaluation within a single domain.
Multi-domain learning Multi-Domain Learning (MDL) refers to a method for learning datasets
from multiple domains with various distributions together. MDL originated from natural language
processing [ 11,17] and has been applied to various tasks in computer vision [ 36,37,22,32,49,

the entire score distribution produced by the AC Classifier.
48,56,18]. The difficulty of MDL arises when the difference in distribution between domains is
significant, and learning domain-invariant features is the basic approach [ 39]. In the fields of image
classification [ 36,37,22], object tracking [ 32], detection [ 49], and segmentation [ 48], methods for
learning multiple domains with multiple heads have been proposed. After that, methods have been
proposed to have a unified label space [ 56,18], but in this process, the problem that the labels
are different for each domain arises. [ 18] solved the label conflict problem by proposing class-
independent loss using the Null class strategy. On the other hand, V AD has only two classes, normal
and abnormal, so there is no explicit label conflict problem, but there is an implicit abnormal conflict
problem where the definition of a label is different for each domain.
A similar method is multi-task learning [ 54], which considers differences between tasks rather than
domains. In addition, multi-source domain adaptation [ 35] utilizes data from the target domain, and
domain generalization [ 10,40,12] requires adaptation to an unseen target domain. The difference
with these tasks is that they basically share the label space between the source and target domains,
while MDL for V AD has different label definitions.
F Discussions
F.1 Pseudo label of AC Classifier
The purposes of the AC Classifier is the facilitation of feature learning with consideration of the
discrepancies across multiple domains. In cases where snippet is entirely normal or abnormal across
all datasets, the AC score is low, making it difficult to directly use it for the abnormal score. Noisy
samples can indeed have a negative impact on training in Eq. 6. However, in cases where even one of
the multiple datasets has a different definition of normal and abnormal, it is crucial to sensitively detect
conflicts in such samples, leading us to decide that using a difference is preferable. In Table A3, we
conducted ablation studies with Std. ( τ= 0.1) and a fixed value ( yAC
i= 1where 0.3< sa
Dd,i<0.7)
which revealed no significant differences between the methods.
F.2 Abnormal conflict score
Fig. A5 depicts the output abnormal conflict scores from the AC classifier of the E1 held-in model.
While all events are considered normal in UCFC, (a) and (b) correspond to the Pedestrian on Road
abnormal category in TAD (as shown in Fig. 1(c)). Therefore, unlike (c) and (d), the normal situations
of people shopping in a grocery store, (a) and (b) exhibit elevated abnormal conflict scores.
F.3 Abnormal score
Fig. A6 compares the abnormal scores of our model, trained with NullAng-MIL + AC classifier, and
the MIL model trained with MIL loss on a single head in the E2 multiple dataset setting. In scenario

contrast, our model that trained with multiple heads to avoid domain conflicts categorizes only the
arrest defined in UCFC as an abnormal event.
Scenarios (c) and (d) involve abnormal videos in the ST dataset where a running person or car
appears on the walkway. Because these scenarios are classified as normal scenes in other datasets
during training, the MIL model considers them as normal. However, our model, recognizing them
as abnormal scenes corresponding to ST, outputs high abnormal scores. Thus, when learning from
multiple datasets, it is crucial to avoid conflicts by simultaneously learning domain-agnostic features
with the AC classifier and predicting domain-specific scores using multiple heads according to each
dataset’s criteria.

543 videos across 29 scenes with 22 types of anomaly categories. Same as MDV AD benchmark, we
reorganize Training set with 210 number of normal videos and 176 number of abnormal videos where
training anomaly categories are falling, dancing, walking injured, running injured, crawling and
stumbling walk and testing anomalies are running, having a seizure, laying down, shuffling, walking
drunk, people and car accident, car crash, jumping, fire, smoke, jaywalking and driving outside lane .
The Table A5 shows the performance in each target domain when trained with MDV AD and UBNor-
mal under the E1: held-in setting. In the single-head MIL baseline, there is a performance drop when
trained with MDV AD+UBN, indicating difficulty in handling AC. However, the model trained with
multiple heads and the AC classifier shows improved results. By leveraging the virtual dataset, we
can overcome data limitations and create a general model capable of handling diverse and complex
scenes.

ing the WSAL [ 30] model as a base-
line to validate our proposed method on
the MDV AD benchmark’s four protocols.
The Table A6 presents the results, where
all settings are consistent with the other
experiments in the paper. The results
show the addition of multi-head learning
with NullAng-MIL and the AC Classifier
to the WSAL model brings performance
gains which effectively operate across
different baselines. Notably, in the E3 and E4, which shows the target adaptation of the pre-trained
general model, the method yielded competitive results. Future studies can be delve deeper into
studying more sophisticated baselines for resolving AC within the MDV AD setting.
22F.6 Failure cases
Fig. A7(a) presents an abnormal test video from UCFC corresponding to Arrest anomalies. However,
this video includes scenes of Stealing , leading to the subsequent arrest and physical fighting. Both the
MIL and our models output high abnormal scores for scenes other than the Arrest , as they correspond
toStealing andFighting abnormal categories in UCFC. Models predict accurately in categories other
than Arrest , but this failure is observed because of a single abnormal label for each video.
In Fig. A7(b), an abnormal event from ST is considered normal by both models, as other datasets
are generally classified as normal. Similarly, in Fig. A7(c), the skateboarder is deemed normal,
resulting in a false negative failure case. However, these situations are challenging to identify as
severe abnormalities from a general perspective. This failure case is able to be addressed through
low-shot learning or fine-tuning based on ST’s criteria.
F.7 Broader Impacts
The development of Multi-Domain Learning for Generalizable V AD enhances the reliability and
accuracy of security and surveillance systems across diverse environments, thereby improving public
safety. This research advances AI and machine learning by addressing domain adaptation challenges,
promoting robust and generalizable systems. Additionally, it underscores the importance of ethical
considerations and privacy, ensuring that advanced surveillance technologies are deployed responsibly
and transparently.
23NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Abstract, § 1, and § 1.1.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In § 5 and F.6
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
24Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In § 4 and § C
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
25Justification: We will release the data and code when the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In § 4, § C, and Table A4
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not reprot the error bars but all reported experimental results are average
of 3-fold setting.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
26•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In § C
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have complied with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In § F.7
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
27generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In § A
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
28Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
