Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance across
a spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Yet, their application to
knowledge graphs (KGs), which describe facts in the form of triplets and allow
minimal hallucinations, remains an underexplored frontier. In this paper, we
investigate the integration of LLMs with KGs by introducing a specialized KG
Language (KGL), where a sentence precisely consists of an entity noun, a relation
verb, and ends with another entity noun. Despite KGL’s unfamiliar vocabulary to
the LLM, we facilitate its learning through a tailored dictionary and illustrative
sentences, and enhance context understanding via real-time KG context retrieval
and KGL token embedding augmentation. Our results reveal that LLMs can
achieve fluency in KGL, drastically reducing errors compared to conventional KG
embedding methods on KG completion. Furthermore, our enhanced LLM shows
exceptional competence in generating accurate three-word sentences from an initial
entity and interpreting new unseen terms out of KGs.
1 Introduction
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important resources for many data-driven applications, offering struc-
tured repositories of factual information that empower a variety of intelligent tasks [ 1,2]. Yet, the
strides made through the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) have challenged the
conventional reliance on KGs. Nonetheless, LLMs are often critiqued for their susceptibility to
generating factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs–a phenomenon known as the “hallucination
problem” [3, 4]. Many recent studies propose to resort KGs to mitigate this problem [5–8].
In this paper, we investigate the capacity of LLMs to assimilate and generate knowledge graph facts
proficiently. For example, the natural language sentence, “Wendee Lee is an actor in Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers,” translates into a KG triplet format as (Wendee Lee, actor of, Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers) . It is worth noting that, English names such as Wendee Lee andMighty Morphin Power
Rangers , while can serve as identifiers for entities, are perceived as atomic elements within the KG
framework. They are indivisible and distinct from their constituent words or characters.
When the LLMs interpret these text identifiers as mere sequences of tokens, they risk producing
output that misrepresents entities or relations, therefore compromising the integrity of KG-based
tasks. Consequently, existing research that integrates LLMs with KGs tends to limit its scope to
relatively straightforward tasks. Examples of these limitations include validating the correctness of

Figure 1: A workflow of MKGL (from bottom to top). The instruction to the LLM includes a
dictionary exemplifying the entity eiand relation rk. The task is to construct new KG sentences
initialized with eirk. The tokenizer first tokenizes the input text, where the entities and relations
are represented as special tokens out of the original vocabulary. (a) To process these special tokens,
MKGL collects the embeddings of their constituting text tokens; (b) Then, a retriever performs a
4-step process to aggregate textual and relational information into KGL token embeddings. The
first and the last steps are LoRA-like down-scaling and up-scaling operations [ 12]; (c) The output

fully-formed triplets [ 9], or picking an appropriate entity from a limited set of options [ 10]. Given the
sheer volume of entities in a KG, such narrow applications fall short in addressing more complicated
tasks like KG completion, wherein a model predicts missing components of a provided incomplete
triplet, e.g., identifying the unknown tail entities in (Wendee Lee, actor of, ?) against thousands of
candidates. While these methods may lean on pretrained KG embedding models to narrow down
possible candidates, the process remains inefficient.
To transcend the limitations on predictive scope, we propose a novel approach, named MKGL , to
instruct an LLM in the lexicon of the unique KG language (KGL) . KGL sentences are strictly three-
word sentences, starting with an entity noun, followed by a relation verb, and ending with another
entity noun. The vocabulary of KGL does not immediately resonate with the machines. A common
triplet like (Wendee Lee, actor of, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) is encoded abstractly as eirkej,
withei,ejsymbolizing the entity nouns and rjdenoting the relation verb. For an LLM such as
Llama-2 [ 11], these symbols are entirely alien, absent from its pretraining corpus. Our investigation
thus centers on how an LLM can navigate and master this specialized, atomic language of KGs.
As illustrated in Figure 1, to bridge this comprehension gap, we introduce an English-KGL dictionary,
and the LLM is supposed to assemble new KG sentences using the provided linguistic building
blocks. The basic elements of KGL, while different from our natural language, are familiar to the
LLM as they are constructed from the pretrained token embeddings. We leverage a context retriever
to retrieve the text information and relational information of a KGL token, which transforms the
sequential token embeddings of its name into an embedding vector. Subsequently, we update the
LLM token embedding layer with new KGL token embeddings. In the scoring layer, we also employ
a KG score retriever to supplement the LLM with extra KG relational information for prediction.
Instructing an LLM in KGL offers three main advantages over prompt-based methods [ 10,13] or
conventional KG embedding methods [ 14,15]: (1) Broadened applicability. KGL tokens originate
from textual tokens of an LLM, thus our method does not mandate that all entities be observed during
training. (2) End-to-end framework. Unlike recent LLM-based methods that necessitate pre-sorted
results from conventional KG embedding methods, our approach can rapidly rank all candidate
entities at one-step. (3) High efficiency. The representations of KG tokens are derived from pretrained
token embeddings rather than learned from scratch. The proposed KGL context and score retrievers
also leverage a LoRA-like adaption. Using Llama-2-7b [ 11] as the base LLM, the number of training
parameters is less than 0.3%.
2However, instructing an LLM in KGL also has its limitations, as it demands more computational
resources compared with conventional methods. For instance, fine-tuning MKGL (Llama-2-7b)
on the FB15k-237 dataset [ 16] to outperform most conventional methods requires only 1epoch.
Nevertheless, with 8A100 GPUs, it still takes half an hour, which is comparable to training a TransE
model from scratch with a single GPU.
2 Related Works
We category the related works into two groups:
Knowledge Graph Completion KG completion can be regarded as a classification problem like
many NLP tasks [ 17–21], such as node classification and semantic role labeling. However, its label
space is significantly larger than most NLP tasks. For example, the WN18RR [ 22] dataset contains
over 40,000 different entities, making it impractical to simply feed them all as possible results and
let the LLM select one as output. Most conventional KG completion methods are embedding-based
methods, including the triplet-based methods [ 23–27], e.g, TransE [ 23], ComplEx [ 25], RotatE [ 26];
the GNN-based methods [ 15,28–32], e.g., DAN [ 15], CompGCN [ 28], CoKE [ 29]; and other neural-
based methods [ 22,33–35], e.g., ConvE [ 22] and RSN [ 34]. Despite differences in their neural
methods and input forms, all these methods focus on relational information and are not good at
utilizing other types of information such as textual attributes.
Pretrained Language Models for Knowledge Graphs Leveraging Pretrained language models
for KG completion has been explored for many years [ 36]. Some works treat BERT as a GNN model
to encode graph features [ 30,37], while others consider the textual information of KGs and use
pretrained BERT to encode the textual labels of entities and relations [ 14,38–40]. The resulting
outputs are regarded as the entity and relation embeddings or their concatenations.
With the rapid advancements in leveraging LLMs for KG completion, recent works have begun design-
ing prompts or instructions to guide LLMs in this task. Initially, the results were not promising [ 41],
as it appeared that even state-of-the-art LLMs without context information could not outperform
basic KG embedding models like TransE. However, subsequent works such as KGLlama [ 42] and
KoPA [ 13] discovered that LLMs might perform better in triplet classification, i.e., estimating the
correctness of a given triplet.
More recently, KICGPT [ 10] has proposed leveraging in-context learning [ 43,44] to provide explicit
instructions and guide the behavior of LLMs. This involves a triplet-based KG embedding model
to generate the initial rankings of the top-k entities, followed by a multi-round interaction with the
LLM, providing textual information and triplet demonstrations for the query entity and relation.
The LLM should then re-rank the initial list. KICGPT has achieved state-of-the-art results on KG
completion tasks. However, its performance not only depends on the LLM and the instructions but
also on the pretrained KG embedding model. Additionally, KICGPT cannot be deployed offline due
to the demand of commercial LLMs [45]. It also cannot provide embeddings for downstream tasks.
In contrast, the proposed MKGL has an embedding module based on the LLM token embeddings
and KG relational information, which overcomes the weaknesses of existing KG embedding methods
that cannot provide embeddings for unseen entities. The context information is implicitly encoded
into the KGL token embeddings and efficiently captured by the LLM during fine-tuning.
3 Mastery of KG Language
In this section, we discuss the details of MKGL. We first introduce the general architecture of an
LLM and how to convert a KG triplet into a fine-tuning instruction. Then, we present the details of
constructing KGL token embeddings and scores. Finally, we illustrate how to train an MKGL and
analyze its complexity.
3.1 Preliminaries
We start by a brief introduction to KGs and LLMs.
3Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Graph Language Knowledge graphs are conceptualized as
directed, multi-relational graphs. We describe a knowledge graph by G= (T,E,R), where T,E,
Rare the sets of triplets, entities, and relations, respectively. KG language (KGL) is construed as a
rigorously defined three-word construct, mirroring the structure of a simple sentence. Specifically, a
KGL sentence eirkejinvariably commences with an entity noun ei∈ E, proceeds with a relation verb
rk∈ R, and culminates with another entity noun ej∈ E. Analogous to the syntactic conventions in
Chinese, KGL sentences eschew the use of spaces or commas to demarcate KGL terms.
Knowledge Graph Completion KG completion is one of the most important tasks in the KG
area. The target of KG completion is to predict the head entity eigiven the relation and tail entity
(?, rj, ek), or predict the tail entity ekgiven (ei, rj,?). In the scenario of KGL, this task is equivalent
to completing the KG sentence ?rjekorekrj?.
The inductive KG completion focus on completing an unobserved KG Gind= (Tind,Eind,Rind).
Specifically, the relation set Rindis identical to the original set R, but the inductive entity set Eind
shares no elements with E, i.e.,Eind∩ E=∅. The triplet set Tindis further split into the fact set
Tind-fact and test set Tind-test . We train a model on the original triplet set Tand use the fact set Tind-fact
as context to evaluate it on the test set Tind-test .
Large Language Models As depicted on the left side of Figure 1, the architecture of a typical
LLM can be divided into four main components:
•Tokenizer, which breaks down the input sequence of words w0, w1, ..., w minto tokens t0, t1, ..., t n;
•Token embedding, which maps the input tokens t0, t1, ..., t nto a sequence of low-dimensional
vectors t0,t1, ...,tn;
•Transformer M, the core of the LLM, which consists of multiple attention-based blocks that
process the input token embeddings into hidden states:
h0,h1, ...,hn=M(t0,t1, ...,tn); (1)
•Score layer, which features a weight matrix S∈RN×dwith an identical shape to the token
embedding matrix T∈RN×d, where N,ddenote the vocabulary size and hidden size, respectively.
The score layer projects the output of Transformer at the n-th step to a probability distribution pn+1
for predicting the next token tn+1:
pn+1=hnS, (2)
3.2 Instruct an LLM in KG Language
Recent studies reveal that LLMs harbor the potential to acquire unfamiliar natural languages [ 46,47].
Given this premise, it is of particular interest to investigate how LLMs might interpret and operate
within our KGL. We first design a prototype instructional text for this purpose. For a given triplet
(Wendee Lee, actor of, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) , suppose that the task is to predict the tail
entity Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , the instructional text is formatted as follows:
Instruction 3.1. Supposed that you are a linguist versed in an esoteric three-word knowledge graph

complete the following sentence: <kgl: Wendee Lee ><kgl: actor of >
Here, <kgl: Wendee Lee >denotes the definitive KGL token (corresponding to eiin previous
sections and Figure 1) assigned to the entity Wendee Lee . We enrich the tokenizer’s vocabulary with
all pertinent KGL tokens, thereby enabling it to translate these KGL tokens into token IDs, which
append sequentially to the LLM’s original vocabulary range. It is worth noting that we only provide
at most one example KGL sentence for each KGL word. Our intention is to introduce the schematics
of KGL sentences to the LLM, rather than leveraging augmented KG data for in-context learning. To
mitigate potential biases, the example sentences are sampled randomly.

aggregated by multi-layered PNA encoders to retrieve neighboring information within KG; (e) The

3.3 In-Context Learning versus Special Token Embedding
The practice of incorporating supplementary context information alongside instructional prompts,
known as in-context learning (ICL), has proven effective in enhancing performance across many NLP
tasks [ 43,44]. However, the concatenation of retrieved context on KGs with the input text can easily
exceed the input length constraints of LLMs. Processing such long input sequences remains com-
putationally intensive even with truncation. To address these constraints, we propose an alternative
approach to encode context information into compact vector representations. Our experiments in
Section 4.6 also demonstrate its superiority in terms of both efficiency and performance.
3.4 LoRA-based KGL Context Retriever
We propose the low-rank adaption (LoRA)-based KGL context Retriever Rcontext to effectively
aggregate textual and KG information into KGL token embeddings. Typically, the vocabulary
scope of a KG (comprising both entities and relations) usually surpasses that of an LLM. For
instance, WN18RR is a KG completion dataset set sampled from WordNet [ 48]. It has over 40,000
unique entities, while the vocabulary size of Llama-2-7b is 32,000. Therefore, initializing new
token embeddings for each KG elements and optimizing them from scratch would be prohibitively
resource-intensive.
Moreover, the dynamic nature of real-world KGs consistently introduces new entities. This is
analogous to the evolution of human language, where new words are often synthesized or derived
from existing ones. Drawing inspiration from this linguistic adaptability, we propose leveraging
existing textual tokens to generate new KGL tokens, thereby avoiding the computational burden of
learning unique embeddings for every KG element.
Scale Down As illustrated in Figure 2, the first step is to reduce the dimensionality of LLM token
embeddings to lower computational demands during text and KG context aggregation. Inspired by
LoRA [ 12], we leverage a projection matrix WT∈Rd×rto transform the token embedding matrix
T∈RN×dinto a reduced space RN×r:
Tr=TWT, (3)
where Tr∈RN×rrepresents the compact token embedding matrix.
Retrieve Text Information We leverage a text encoder to encode the textual token embeddings
of each KGL token into a unified vector. For example, the entity name “Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers” would be converted into individual token embeddings tei,0,tei,1, ...,tei,n, which are then
aggregated into a single vector for the entity ei:
tei=Etext(tei,0,tei,1, ...,tei,n), (4)
5where teiis the textual token embedding for ei. The choice of the encoder Etextis free. In this paper,
we leverage principal neighbourhood aggregation (PNA) [ 49], which can be roughly understood as
applying multiple pooling operations (including max, min, mean, std etc.) on the token embedding
sequences. A detailed introduction to PNA can be found in Appendix C.
Retrieve KG Information We employ a multi-layered PNA encoder Ekgto aggregate the KG
information of eiand its adjacent entities, which can be formulated as:
t′
ei=Ekg(tei,N(ei)), (5)
where N(ei)denotes the neighboring entities to ei. The adoption of PNA for encoding both textual
and relational data of KGL tokens is due to its parameter efficiency and superior performance
compared to attention-based alternatives like GAT [ 50]. An empirical comparison of different
encoders can be found in Appendix F.
Scale Up To finalize, we adjust the dimensionality of the output embeddings to align with the LLM
input requirements:
t′′
ei=t′
eiWB (6)
For the sake of clarity, we will continue to use teito represent the KGL token embedding in
subsequent discussions. For efficiency, we retrieve the KG information only for entities. This
operation also make the embeddings of entities and relations distinguishable.
3.5 Reconstructing Vocabulary or Constraining the Output Space
While recent studies have adapted LLMs to various tasks by either restricting the output space or
reformulating tasks into multiple-choice questions [ 9,10,51–53], such strategies pose challenges for
KG completion. Specifically, the existing methods are inapplicable to entity constrastive learning as
their main objective is optimized against text tokens instead of entities. Also, they incur significantly
slow inference times, as the LLM must traverse to the output tree’s leaf nodes to generate predictions.
Even then, the generation of top- kresults, dependent on beam search parameters, may not accurately
reflect the true likelihoods of entities.
In contrast, in this paper we propose a new approach to reconstruct the KGL scores through LLM’s
score layer and hidden states, providing a one-shot probability distribution for all candidates. Our
method seamlessly integrates with contrastive loss and negative sampling techniques [ 54], making it
highly compatible with prevalent KG completion frameworks. This compatibility also ensures that
MKGL has the potential of being applied for downstream KG embedding tasks [32, 55].
3.6 LoRA-based KGL Score Retriever
We propose a LoRA-based KGL score retriever Rscoreto produce the probability distribution of KGL
tokens, which can be formulated as follows:
S′=SWS,h′
n=hnWH (Down Scaling) (7)
s′
j=Stext(s′
j,0,s′
j,1, ...,sj,n), (Text Information Retrieval) (8)
s′′
ej|ei,rk=Skg([h′
n,s′
j],N(ej)) (Conditioned Retrieval) (9)
pej|ei,rk=s′′
ej|ei,rkWO (Score Estimation) (10)
The score retriever also starts from a down-scaling layer to reduce the dimensionality of the score
matrix S∈RN×dtoSR∈RN×rwithWS, and similarly scales down the LLM’s output hidden vec-
torhnwithWH. Subsequently, the text information (i.e., the token score vectors s′
j,0,s′
j,1, ...,sj,n)
associated with target entity ejis fed to the score text encoder Stextto construct the KGL score vector
s′
j. It is then concatenated with the LLM hidden state h′
nto obtain the conditioned input [h′
n,s′
j].
Upon gathering the neighboring information of the target entities via a multi-layered PNA Skg, an
output matrix WO∈Rr×1is employed to map the result s′′
ej|ei,rk∈Rrto the 1-d probability
estimate pej|ei,rk∈R.

Optimization With the above score retriever, estimating the probability for any candidate entity
becomes straightforward at a single step. To refine MKGL, we consider a contrastive loss leveraged
in most existing KG embedding methods [22, 23, 28, 34], expressed as:
L=X
(ei,rk,ej)∈T train
−log(pej|ei,rk) +1
|Nneg(ej)|X
eneg∈N neg(ej)log(1−peneg|ei,rk)
, (11)
where Nneg(ej) ={eneg|eneg̸=ej, eneg∈ E} is the sampled negative entity set for the target
entity ej. The loss function Lis in a form of a binary cross-entropy, contrasting the likelihood of
correctly predicting the relation pej|ei,rkas positive example, against the probabilities of erroneously
predicting relations (ei, rk, eneg)as negative examples. We also present an algorithm to demonstrate
the step-by-step fine-tuning process, please refer to Appendix D for details.
3.7 Complexity
It is clear that the primary computational cost for MKGL lies in the LLM. By employing LoRA-based
KGL retrievers to retrieve context vectors instead of texts, we can significantly reduce the major
expenditure. For instance, our retrievers can reduce the average input lengths from 811.2 to 91.4 on
the FB15k-237 dataset, compared to using one-hop neighbors for in-context learning. All operations
within the LoRA-based retrievers are performed under low dimensionality. Furthermore, the token
embeddings and score matrix of the LLM are frozen during fine-tuning, thus ignoring their gradient
computation. In the worst case, the complexity of text information retrieval is O(NkglLkglr), where
Nkgl,Lkgl,rare the number of KGL tokens, maximum text token lengths of KGL tokens, and the
reduced dimensionality, respectively. Subsequently, the complexity of KG information retrieval in the
worst case is linear to the number of triplets, i.e., O(|T |Nlayerr), where |T |,Nlayerdenote the number
of triplets in the KG and the number of PNA layer, respectively.

comparing it against both LLM-based and KG embedding methods. The source code and datasets are

4.2 Settings
For our experiments, we employ Llama-2-7b [ 11] as the base LLM and train MKGL using 8A100
GPUs. A standard LoRA adaptation is applied to the query and value layers of the LLM. Full
hyper-parameter details are available in Appendix D. We evaluate performance using MRR (mean
reciprocal rank of target entities) and Hits@ k(percentage of target entities ranked in the top k).
Our baselines include conventional KG embedding methods such as TransE [ 23], RotatE [ 26], and

that integrate language models including KG-BERT [ 14], StAR [ 38], KGLM [ 40], FTL-LM [ 39],
and DET [ 30]; and LLM-based methods: KG-Llama [ 42], GPT 3.5 [ 41], and KICGPT [ 10]. In
the inductive scenario, we compare against rule-based reasoning methods such as RuleN [ 60],
NeuralLP [ 33], DRUM [ 61], GraIL [ 58] and RED-GNN [ 59], acknowledging that standard methods
fail to predict relations without entity embeddings.
4.3 Knowledge Graph Completion
The knowledge graph completion results are presented in Table 2. MKGL outperforms other baselines
in nearly all metrics. Notably, MKGL and KICGPT significantly surpass other LLM-based methods,
demonstrating the importance of KG relational information. Contrarily, many BERT-based methods
fall short against GNN-based methods, suggesting that merely incorporating text information may
not yield the anticipated benefits. In summary, the proposed MKGL clearly outshines its counterparts,
particularly those founded on commercial LLMs.
To our knowledge, existing LLM-based methods have not addressed the inductive KG completion
challenge. We benchmark MKGL against the state-of-the-art inductive methods. Although we can

not assess KICGPT [ 10] due to unavailable source code, it is worth mentioning that our MKGL could
potentially augment KICGPT by supplying a candidate list, facilitating seamless integration between
the two methods. We present the results in Table 3. MKGL significantly outperforms all the baseline
methods across metrics. As most inductive reasoning methods do not have an embedding module for
entities, the proposed MKGL represents the first embedding-based method to deliver state-of-the-art
results in inductive KG completion.
4.4 Knowledge Graph Language Modeling
Beyond its capability as a KG completion tool, MKGL also serves as a language model for KG
languages. To evaluate its proficiency in generating KGL sentences, we employ a sequence generation
loss and remove the relation context from the input prompts. We leverage the second-to-last output of
the LLM for relation prediction.
The results are shown in Figure 3. The left section contrasts the sequence prediction results against
standard KG completion, revealing only a modest loss in performance. MKGL still outperforms many
conventional methods, especially on WN18RR dataset. The right panel displays sample sentences
generated by MKGL, illustrating its potential to discover legitimate KGL sentences absent from
the existing KG. We observe that WN18RR is more difficult than anticipated as it contains many
plausible entities that challenge even an LLM’s discernment.
4.5 Ablation Study
We conduct ablation studies to assess the importance of each module, as detailed in Table 4. The
unmarked cells indicate that we either substitute the text retrieval module with a learnable embedding
module or remove the KG retrieval module. Clearly, the method with complete features achieves
best results, while replacing or removing either module significantly impacts performance. Notably,
removing the KG retrieval module yields more performance loss on WN18RR, as many entities in
this dataset have similar names. For example, there are 14different entities named “call”. In this case,
incorporating with KG information becomes necessary.
4.6 Computational Cost
We examine the computational efficiency of our method (MKGL) relative to “in-context” baselines.
Specifically, we develop several variants: LLM randomly-initialized new entity token embeddings
(NewToken), LLM with KGL context from 1-hop neighbors (NewToken (1-hop)), LLM with KGL
context from 2-hop neighbors (NewToken (2-hop)), and MKGL without score retriever (MKGL w/o
9SR). The results are shown in Figure 4. MKGL surpasses all alternatives in performance. NewToken
variants slightly lag behind MKGL w/o SR, but notably, our proposed methods demand fewer
trainable parameters than NewToken variants. By encoding all context information within KGL
token embeddings, the average input length is significantly reduced, which decreases training time
considerably. Moreover, MKGL supports larger batch sizes during both training and inference phases,
enhancing computational efficiency.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we propose MKGL to instruct the LLM in the language of KGs. MKGL employs
a context retriever that efficiently provides LLMs with pertinent textual and relational context,
markedly reducing input lengths relative to in-context-learning and supervised fine-tuning methods.
Meanwhile, MKGL also leverages a score retriever to supply score information and aid in KGL
inference. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of MKGL in terms of both performance
and computational efficiency. The proposed context and score retrievers point out a new direction in
incorporating LLMs with semantic data, such as question answering and entity linking. They may
also shed lights on a more broaden area where the input cannot be precisely represented by text,
e.g., node classification and protein representation learning. Furthermore, the construction of KGL
vocabulary enables contrastive learning not only limited on tokens, which may provide insights on
general machine learning. Therefore, there are plenty of future directions. We would like to pretrain
LLM using the mixture corpora of KG and natural languages, such that the LLM could understand
and create responses with linked data.

14A Limitations
We would like to discuss the potential limitations of our method from the following three aspects:
Efficiency. As MKGL is an LLM-based fine-tuning method, it inevitably demands more computa-
tional resources. In the main experiments, MKGL significantly outperforms all the conventional
and LLM-based methods. The later analysis also reveal that the trainable parameters and runtime of
MKGL are less than general fine-tuning framework. Therefore, we believe that MKGL is still an
efficient LLM-based method.
Robustness. MKGL leverage multiple retrievers to retrieve text and KG information for constructing
both input embeddings and score estimations, which may accumulate more errors during fine-tuning.
Even though, most modules are learnable with back-propagation. To avoid biased evaluation and
occasional results, we also report the averaged results of multiple runs with variance statistics. Thus,
we believe MKGL is a robust method.
Generality. The advances in LLMs have revolutionized many NLP tasks, and it is important for an
LLM-based method where the LLM makes use of the proposed modules and whether the performance
can continually improves as the LLM get promotion. We have conducted experiments to visualize the
KGL embeddings and compare the performance with different base LLMs. The results empirically
demonstrate the generality and potential of MKGL.
B Broader Impacts
Our work focuses on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) through the introduction of a specialized KG Language (KGL), has substantial broader impacts
spanning technological advancements, societal implications, and educational benefits. Here, we
outline the diverse and far-reaching impacts of our research.
Technological Advancements Our research contributes to the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence,
pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve when combined with the structured knowledge
represented by KGs. This can potentially unlock new capabilities in AI, ranging from more accurate
context-aware natural language understanding to enhanced machine reasoning across diverse domains
such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems. Additionally, our approach of using a specialized
language (KGL) and the method of contextual embedding augmentation can inspire novel AI archi-
tectures and learning paradigms that bridge the gap between unstructured and structured forms of
knowledge.
Societal Implications The enhancement of AI systems with a more profound understanding of
structured knowledge has broad societal implications. For one, it could lead to the development of AI
assistants that provide more accurate, consistent, and reliable information, thus improving decision-
making in critical sectors. In healthcare, for instance, AI systems equipped with our technology
could offer more precise recommendations by thoroughly understanding medical knowledge graphs.
Moreover, by reducing the propensity for errors and hallucinations, our approach could foster greater
trust in AI technologies among the general public, paving the way for wider acceptance and integration
into daily life.
Ethical Considerations As with any advancement in AI, our work prompts important ethical
considerations. Ensuring our technology is used responsibly involves critical discussions around
privacy, bias, and transparency, especially as AI systems become more adept at interpreting and
generating human-like text. We advocate for the continued examination of these aspects in tandem
with technological development to ensure AI benefits society equitably and ethically. Our work, by
facilitating error reduction in AI outputs, also contributes to the broader effort of minimizing harm
and bias in AI-generated content.
Educational Benefits Our integration of LLMs with KGs presents a novel avenue for educational
tools and applications. AI tutors or educational platforms powered by our enhanced LLMs can offer
students personalized and accurate learning experiences. Such systems could better understand and
integrate complex academic content structured within knowledge graphs, from history timelines to
15scientific concepts, thereby improving the quality of automated tutoring services and opening up new
methods for engaging with educational material.
Future Directions This research opens up exciting avenues for future exploration, including
refining the KGL for broader applicative scopes, exploring the ethical considerations of nuanced
AI-generated content, and expanding our understanding of AI’s potential when it deeply integrates
diverse forms of knowledge. The cross-disciplinary nature of this work invites collaboration among
computer scientists, ethicists, domain experts, and policymakers to harness the full potential of AI for
societal benefit.
In conclusion, the integration of LLMs with KGs not only represents a significant step forward in AI
capabilities but also poses thoughtful considerations for societal impact, ethical use, and educational
applications. Our work underscores the importance of continuous exploration, responsible innovation,
and cross-disciplinary collaboration to harness the transformative potential of AI technologies.
C Principal Neighborhood Aggregation
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful family of neural models for learning
on graph-structured data [ 17,18,62]. Among the recent advances is the principal neighborhood
aggregation (PNA) mechanism [ 49], which enhances the representational capacity of GNNs by
diversifying the aggregation functions applied to neighboring nodes.
PNA leverages a combination of multiple aggregators such as sum, mean, and standard deviation,
together with a scalable degree-specific weighting scheme. This approach is designed to address the
shortcomings associated with simple aggregation functions that may fail to capture the complexity
and diversity of neighborhood structures in graphs.
The key component of PNA is its aggregation scheme, which is formally defined as follows:
a(l+1)
v =δ
M
ρ∈RAGG ρ({h(l)
u,∀u∈ N(v)}), W(l)
 (12)
Please note that the symbols used in describing PNA are independent to the main paper for clarity.
Here, a(l+1)
v is the aggregated information for node vat layer l+1,N(v)denotes the set of neighbors
ofv,h(l)
urepresents the hidden features of neighbor nodes at layer l,Lis a concatenation operator
over all aggregators in the set R,AGG ρis an aggregation function (e.g., sum, mean, max), δis a
nonlinear activation function such as ReLU, and W(l)is a learnable weight matrix at layer l.
a(l+1)
v =δ
M
ρ∈RAGG ρ({h(l)
u⊗h(l)
r,∀(v, r, u )∈ T } ), W(l)
 (13)
PNA’s distinctive blend of multiple aggregation functions and degree-aware weighting significantly
enhances the expressive power of GNNs, allowing for more complex feature representations and,
consequently, improved performance on downstream tasks. We also follow the KG embedding
methods [15, 28, 63] to incorporate the relation embeddings into PNA as relational PNA.
D Implementation Details
We introduce Algorithm 1 to demonstrate the fine-tuning process of MKGL for KG completion. We
first construct input instructions following Instruction 3.1 and tokenize them into IDs. For those in the
score of original LLM vocabulary, their embeddings can be looked up from T, while those of out of
scope will be retrieved by our context retriever Rcontext . After assembling the input embeddings, we
feed them to the LLM to obtain output hidden states and then obtain the scores from the score retriever
Rscore. Finally, we optimize MKGL by minimizing the constrastive loss L. The main hyper-parameter
settings are summarized in Table 5.

E Dataset Details
We use the following benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of MKGL, and summarize the
statistics in Table 6:
•FB15k-237: This dataset is a subset of the original FB15k dataset [ 23] and is created by
removing inverse relations that may lead to test set leakage.
•WN18RR: This dataset is a subset of the original WN18 dataset [ 23] and is created by
removing inverse relations that may lead to test set leakage.
•FB15k-237-ind: The ‘ind’ suffix denotes the inductive setting adopted in FB15k-237 [58].
It includes new entities in the validation and test sets that are not present during training,
thus requiring models to generalize beyond the transductive assumptions of previously seen
entities.
•WN18RR-ind: Similarly to FB15k-237-ind, the WN18RR-ind dataset is adapted for
inductive KG completion on the WordNet [48].
These datasets have been instrumental in the development and benchmarking of advanced KG com-
pletion models, enabling comparison of different approaches and understanding of their effectiveness
in both conventional and inductive settings.

F.3 Different Layer Numbers
We conduct experiments to analyze the influence of layer numbers in the KGL retrievers. The results
are illustrated in Figure 6. Clearly, increasing the number of layers enhances performance across all
datasets and metrics. Additionally, we observe that a small number of layers (i.e., 2) significantly
impairs performance.

F.4 Different Encoders
We conduct experiments to explore the impact of different encoders in the retrievers. The results are
depicted in Figure 7. We find that the MKGL is not highly sensitive to the choice of encoders. The
performance when using GAT [50] is slightly lower than when using PNA.
20NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses the limitations of the work.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
21Justification: This paper does not include theoretical result.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper fully discloses all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
22Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The source code is uploaded.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The training and test details are included in appendices.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main results are based on the average of multiple runs.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
23•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provides sufficient information on the computer resources.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research fully conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts in appendices.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
24•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no such risk for this paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All assets are fully licensed.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
25•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All new assets are well documented.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing experiment has been involved.
