Abstract
In this work, we observe that model trained on vast general images via masking
strategy, has been naturally embedded with their distribution knowledge, thus
spontaneously attains the underlying potential for strong image denoising. Based
on this observation, we propose a novel zero-shot denoising paradigm, i.e., Masked
Pre-train then Iterative fill ( MPI ). MPI first trains model via masking and then
employs pre-trained weight for high-quality zero-shot image denoising on a sin-
gle noisy image. Concretely, MPI comprises two key procedures: 1) Masked
Pre-training involves training model to reconstruct massive natural images with
random masking for generalizable representations, gathering the potential for valid
zero-shot denoising on images with varying noise degradation and even in distinct
image types. 2) Iterative filling exploits pre-trained knowledge for effective zero-
shot denoising. It iteratively optimizes the image by leveraging pre-trained weights,
focusing on alternate reconstruction of different image parts, and gradually assem-
bles fully denoised image within limited number of iterations. Comprehensive
experiments across various noisy scenarios underscore the notable advances of
MPI over previous approaches with a marked reduction in inference time. Code

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).1 Introduction
Image denoising [3,4], as a branch of image restoration, has been the subject of extensive exploration.
The prevalent approach to restore noise-degraded images is learning from multiple noisy instances.
Nonetheless, both supervised learning from noisy-clean pairs [5 –7] and unsupervised training [8 –
10] necessitate the collection of additional noisy datasets. Moreover, such methods may foster
dependencies on specific patterns or intensities of training noise, hindering their performance in
unfamiliar noise situations [11, 12].
As an alternative, zero-shot approaches [13 –15] attempt to train network on a single noisy image
for denoised output, negating the need for additional noisy data collection. Dedicated to obviating
concerns about generalization issues, these techniques include blind-spot networks that reconstruct
from corrupted inputs [16,17], DIPs [13,18 –21] which exploit the characteristics of deep networks to
learn the mapping from random noise to noisy images, as well as sub-sample based strategies [22,23]
utilize spatial correlations to generate training pairs from sub-sampled instances.
However, current zero-shot methods train new networks from scratch for each noisy image, which
presents two major issues: 1) Despite success in current zero-shot approaches rely on regularization
or designed priors such as noise perturbations [13], under-parameterized networks [18, 22], dropout-
ensemble [14] and blind-spot networks [16], the limited information from a single image to train
network often lead to overly blurred content, noise artifacts or sub-optimal quality. Several methods
tend to rely on known noise distribution [3, 20, 24] for more information, but their applicability is
limited. 2) Training a new network from scratch for each noisy image is time-consuming. Existing
zero-shot methods typically require several minutes [13] or more [14]. And attempts at faster
zero-shot denoising [22, 23] often compromise on performance.
Compared to previous zero-shot approaches, learning the feature distribution from vast natural images
offers a more intuitive approach. This is grounded in two considerations: Real natural images are
both abundant and readily available, and despite variations in noise patterns, many natural images
share common characteristics [25]. We seek to enhance zero-shot denoising with minimal reliance on
pre-defined priors or regularization, aiming for a better startpoint for various noise patterns instead of
from scratch. To this end, we delve into the potential of masked image modelling [26, 27] on natural
images with no assumptions about noisy patterns and intensities [28]. Specifically, we make the
following observation: combined with a simple ensemble operation, a masked pre-trained model
can naturally denoise images with unseen noise degradation .
Building upon above observation, we introduce a zero-shot denoising paradigm, i.e., Masked Pre-train
then Iterative fill (MPI). MPI first pre-trains a model on ImageNet with pixel-wise masking strategy,
then the pre-trained model is optimized on a single image with unseen noise for denoised prediction
in zero-shot inference stage. The optimization goal in inference is designed to predict masked regions,
and only predictions of masked areas are preserved for denoised prediction, thereby minimizing the
gap between pre-training and inference. The pre-trained weights provide more generic knowledge,
preventing premature over-fitting during inference and reducing the need for strong regularization.
We are able to handle a wider range of noise scenarios with less information about noise patterns or
intensities. Remarkably, we find that extracted representation can even generalize to medical images
that distinctly different from natural ones [2]. It also offers a better startpoint than scratch training,
enabling high-quality denoising around 10 seconds, underscoring the potential of our method in
practical application. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
•We introduce a novel zero-shot denoising paradigm, i.e., Masked Pre-train then Iterative fill
(MPI), which introduces masked pre-training in this context for the first time, simultaneously
improving both image quality and inference speed on unseen noisy images.
•We develop a pre-training scheme with pixel-wise random masks to capture distribution knowl-
edge of natural images. Based on pre-trained knowledge, we propose iterative filling for
zero-shot inference on a specific noisy image. This process is optimized using pre-trained
weights, and focuses on alternatively reconstruct different parts of noisy image, predictions in
iterations are sequentially assembled for high-quality denoised output with efficiency.
•Extensive experiments demonstrate MPI’s superiority, efficiency and robustness in diverse noisy
scenarios. In nutshell, MPI achieves significant performance gains across various noise types
with reduced inference time, highlighting its potential for practical applications.
22 Methods
In Sec. 2.1, we first investigate the properties of models trained with masking, proving that models
trained with masking strategy can learn representations beneficial for denoising. Our observation
lead us to propose a zero-shot denoising paradigm that includes pre-training (Sec. 2.2) and iterative
optimizing (Sec. 2.3). We further illustrate how to remove spatially correlated real noise in Sec. 2.4.

2.1 Motivation
Masked Image Modeling [26, 27, 29] has significantly advanced computer vision by training on vast
natural image sets to grasp their knowledge distributions. It shows great potential applicability under
diverse scenarios and have been proven beneficial for high-level downstream tasks [30, 31].
To further explore its capability in denoising, we train a model on natural images with pixel-wise
random masks (for details, see Sec. 2.2) and assess its performance against a target image with unseen
noise distribution. Surprisingly, we observe that a simple average of predictions from a fixed-state
trained model can denoise on unseen noise, as shown in Fig. 3, sometimes achieve remarkably
good performance, as an example is presented in Fig. 2. This observation suggests that a masked
pre-trained model can serve as a natural image denoiser. However, artifacts exist in the results,
which can be attributed to lack of knowledge about specific degradation patterns in the target image.
Drawing on prior insight, we develop an efficient zero-shot denoising pipeline, leveraging pre-trained
knowledge by incorporating noise characteristics from a single noisy image (Fig. 4), i.e., Masked
Pre-train then Iterative fill. The model is firstly pre-trained with random masks Mand corresponding
element-wise negation ˆMto acquire natural image distributions, formulated as:
arg max
θp(I⊙ˆM|I⊙M;θ), (1)
forIindicates natural image without any degradation priors, typically sourced from extensive datasets
(e.g.ImageNet [28]). We use element-wise multiplication ( ⊙). For denoising on specific noisy image
x, pre-trained parameter θis loaded and further optimized with known xfrom t=1 to t=TforT
iterations, and predictions are aggregated for final prediction y:
y=Ensemble {Dθt(x)}T
t=1, (2)
where Dθt(·)is network parameterized by θt, optimized from pre-trained θ. Masked Pre-training
process is detailed in Sec. 2.2 and Ensemble in Sec. 2.3.
2.2 Masked Pre-training
Masking strategy. Given the distinct requirements between low-level and high-level tasks in “seman-
tics” [32], we implement specialized masking strategy to achieve finer-grained image representations,
i.e., a pixel-wise masking strategy. Specifically, given an input image I∈RH×W×Cdivided into
random patches of size 1, a subset of them are randomly replaced by mask token with probability p
(for further discussion of p, see Sec. 4). When the mask token is set to 0, the masked image M⊙I
with random mask M∈RH×W×Ccorresponds to a bernoulli sampling of the input image I. For

prediction areas ˜I. This directs network efforts towards reconstructing these specific regions, with
the reconstruction loss denoted as Lrec:

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is adopted to learn relatively smoother representation. For the
architecture of network D(·), we employ the same U-shaped hourglass architecture as in DIP [13],
which has been proven a powerful zero-shot denoising architecture [19]. Furthermore, its rela-
tively small parameter configuration enables accelerated training, alleviating potential inference
computational costs and rendering it more appropriate for zero-shot denoising tasks.

2.3 Iterative Filling
Overall design. As observed in Sec. 2.1, an iterative optimization process is designed to leverage
pre-trained knowledge for zero-shot denoising. Unlike other MIM approaches [26, 27] that fine-tune
with entire images as input, since only one noisy image is accessible, we employ a self-supervised
manner to learn the mapping from a noisy image to itself. However, this direct self-mapping approach
introduces significant gap between the zero-shot inference stage and pre-training stage and lacks
constraints for learning a noise identity mapping.
Considering above challenges, we retain the same masking strategy in Sec. 2.2 for both input and
loss computation, i.e., network still learns to reconstruct masked regions, but from single noisy image
rather than natural images. This leads to a pixel-based iterative refinement process, which resembles
mechanism of blind-spot networks [16]. Specifically, for input noisy image x, random mask Mtand
its element-wise negation ˆMtint-th iteration, prediction ytand aggregated result ycan be derived:
yt=Dθt(Mt⊙x); (6a)
y=X
tat·yt⊙ˆMt, (6b)
where θtdenotes network parameter at iteration t,atis corresponding coefficient whereP
tat= 1.
The optimization objective at each iteration is as follows:
arg min
θtˆMt⊙yt−ˆMt⊙x
2. (7)
The optimization task, represented by Lrec(yt, x), learns to reconstruct noisy image cropped by
random masks, aligns with pre-training. The alignment minimizes the gap between pre-training and
zero-shot inference to avoid over-fitting, and reduces the inference steps required, thus accelerating
the denoising process. Thanks to the well-crafted mechanism, we can accomplish high-quality results
with preserved details in reduced time without any other regularization .
Pixel-based iterative refinement. For a lower mask ratio and reconstruction of more detailed images,
we abandon constraints on unmasked regions in previous optimization goals (Eq. 5 and Eq. 7), thus

making information under these areas unreliable, we preserve only the results corresponding to ˆM
for final denoised outcome y. However, as one forward pass provide partial denoising results, an
ensemble process is crucial. Specially, we employ an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy
to optimize the use predictions during iterations with little increase in inference time (Sec. 4):
y=ˆMt⊙(β·y+ (1−β)·yt) +Mt⊙y. (8)
For an in-depth look at proposed ensemble algorithm, see Alg. 1. During inference, the pre-trained
weights not only provide a better startup but also act as regularization for the network, preventing
from over-fitting too early and leading to better performance with less inference time (Sec. 4).
2.4 Adaptation to Real-world Noise Removal
Real-world noise exhibit strong spatial correlations, i.e.the noise is correlated across adjacent pixels.
In such scenarios, employing a straightforward masking mechanism still allows the model to learn
information related to noise patterns. To address this problem, we apply larger masking ratios than
that used for synthetic noise. Additionally, we integrate a simple Pixel-shuffle Down-sampling (PD)
mechanism during zero-shot inference to reduce spatial correlation in noise.
Specifically, instead of directly processing noisy image x∈R1×C×H×Win Eq. 6a, we handle its
down-sampled versions Down (x)∈Rd2×C×H
d×W
dusing simple Pixel-shuffle with factor d, and
d2sub-samples are concatenated along batch dimension for joint denoising. Following the same
iterative filling mechanism described above, we apply pixel unshuffle to the denoised result yto obtain
final denoised outcome Up(y). We add minimal PD operations to address spatial correlated noise,
illustrating the effect of pre-trained weights, performance on real-world noisy dataset can be improved
by applying better sub-sampling approaches [35 –37] (Sec. 4.2) as they have been intensively studied.

Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) on synthetic (Sec. 3.2, Sec. 3.3) and real noise (Sec. 3.4).
Additional tests on medical images (Sec. 3.5) show our method’s adaptability beyond natural images.
3.1 Experimental Setup
Pre-training. Pre-training is performed on two Nvidia RTX 3090 GPUs using Adam optimizer with
β1=0.9 and β2=0.9. Initial learning rate is 2e−3and decays to 1e−5with cosine annealing strategy
over 80K iterations with a batch size of 64. We initiate pre-training on randomly cropped 256 ×256
patches from subset of ImageNet [28] with around 48,000 images. Two sets of pre-trained weights
with masking probability p(p=0.3 for synthetic noise and a higher ratio of 0.8 ∼0.95 for spatially
correlated noise) are trained. Further discussion of pis in Sec. 4.
Zero-shot inference. We set learning rate during inference to 2e−3, and same masking ratio pas
pre-training (0.3 for synthetic, 0.8 ∼0.95 for real noise) is set. EMA weight β=0.99 for 1000 iterations
(specially, 800 iterations for SIDD). Additionally, with β=0.9, we achieve performance surpassing
most zero-shot methods within 200 iterations, denoted as “faster” . See Supp. for detailed setting.
3.2 Gaussian & Poisson Noise
We investigate Gaussian Noise with σ∈[10,25,50] and Poisson noise with λ∈[10, 25, 50] separately
on three datasets: CSet [3], McMaster [33] and CBSD [34], with 9, 18 and 68 high-quality images,
respectively. Results are shown in Table 1. The model is tested across various noise types with same
experimental setups, without prior knowledge of noise distribution or intensity.
Analysis. DIP tends to produce over-blurry results and struggles especially with intense noise. While
ZS-N2N manages to remove weak noise, its simple down-sample approach falters with stronger noise
and cause artifacts. As Fig. 5 illustrates, under Gaussian noise σ=25 and Poisson noise λ=25, our
method excels in both noise reduction and detail preservation. In some cases, we see an improvement
of over 1dB, highlighting the effectiveness of our zero-shot paradigm.
Average inference time is listed in Table 1. Our “faster” version achieve the fastest inference speed
while surpassing comparing methods in most cases. Even with β= 0.99, our method exhibits
competitive inference time and significantly better performance. Params and FLOPs are in Supp.

3.3 Generalization on Unseen Noise
We believe zero-shot denoising with natural image knowledge offers new perspectives on im-
proving generalizability of denoising methods. We select several recent supervised (SwinIR [7],
Restormer [38]) and unsupervised (Neighbor2Neighbor [10], Blind2Unblind [39]) methods trained
on Gaussian with σ=25 for demostration. Testing them on 5 unknown noise types on Kodak [46].
Analysis. As illustrated in Table 2 and Fig. 6, although methods trained on multiple noisy images
achieve better results on noisy cases with the same distribution, they exhibit poor generalization per-
formance. In contrast, zero-shot methods often perform better generalization capabilities, especially
our method which achieves the best performance across all types of generalization noise.
3.4 Real Noisy Datasets
We assess denoising capability of MPI on synthetic noise in previous experiments. However, real-
world noise is more complicated and challenging. We test on SIDD [1] and PolyU [45] datasets,
including 1280 patches from the SIDD validation and 1280 from SIDD benchmark, and all 100
official patches from PolyU to show our paradigm on real images. Due to the differences between
synthetic and real noise, we report results from comparison methods from their optimal iteration.
Analysis. As shown in Table 3, our method excels over other zero-shot approaches on both datasets.
This underlines our method’s effectiveness on real-world noise removal. Fig. 7 show our method’s
capability to balance noise removal and detail retention. In essence, our method is adept at real-world
denoising, offering a robust solution for image quality enhancement in challenging situations.
3.5 Generalization to Medical Images
The pre-trained model, which has learned the feature distributions of natural images, raises a question:
Can this knowledge be applied to other image types? To answer this question, we select a fluorescence
microscopy dataset (FMD) [2] characterized by colors and textures distinctly different from natural
images, using all released 48 images in testset for evaluation. See Supp. for more image types.
Analysis. Our method still excels in denoising performance, as seen in Table 3. Despite such
monochromatic microscopic images are not included in pre-training dataset and exhibits large differ-
ences between natural images, pre-trained knowledge still enhances zero-shot denoising performance,
as evidenced in Fig. 8 and Table 4, demonstrating the generalizability of pre-trained weights.

4 Ablation Study & Discussion
4.1 Ablation
Pre-trained weights. Building on Sec. 2.1, we question the role of pre-trained weights in zero-shot
inference by comparing inference with pre-trained weights and optimizing from scratch, resembling a
standard blind-spot network [16]. As depicted in Fig. 9 and Table 4, the latter quickly peaks and risks
over-fitting due to the simple task of content recovery from masked images, making it challenging to
specify an optimal iteration for all images. Conversely, the pre-trained model achieves better initial
performance and maintains close-to-optimal performance for more extended period of time.
Unlike other zero-shot techniques train models from scratch for a single image to learn noise-resistant
image content, we offer a new perspective by showing that a pre-trained model can aid in zero-shot
tasks. The pre-trained weights, encapsulating views from multiple natural images, making it more
robust to iteration count and provides better options for faster zero-shot denoising.
Moreover, We investigated the impact of pre-training on inference at the hidden layer level (see
Fig. 10). Features extracted with pre-trained weights exhibit significant divergence from those
produced by the baseline, i.e., the usual zero-shot denoising approach. Specifically, pre-trained model
restores the complete image, with more distinct features between layers, whereas the baseline model’s
features are less differentiated between layers, tending to only restore the masked parts, which may
result in sub-optimal convergence towards local minima.
Masking ratios. Fig. 11 shows impact of different masking ratios on denoising with Gaussian σ=25.
Lower masking ratios fails to completely remove noise, while higher masking ratios can cause overly
smoothed results. A 30% masking ratio balances detail preservation and noise reduction for synthetic
noise. However, a higher pof 0.8∼0.95 is required for real-world noise. See Supp. for more details.
Ensemble strategy. We explore ensemble strategies, including EMA-based (“EMA”), straightforward
averaging during iterations (“Average”) and average after specific optimization step (“Avg after 500e”,
where 500 is optimal). Due to the inability to obtain predictions for all pixels in a single forward
pass (Sec. 2.3), the “w/o Ensemble” result comes from the final prediction for each pixel. And “Last”
provided for results of final forward prediction, a significant performance drop is caused by unreliable
pixels (For details, see Supp.). Additionally, to validate our mask-based ensemble strategy, we remove
masks from Eq. 7 and Eq. 8, with full-pixel loss and ensemble (“EMA w/o Mask”). See results in
Table 5. Proposed “EMA” achieve significant better performance, aiding denoising with efficiency.
4.2 Discussion
Our method uses masking and minimal PD during inference to highlight pre-training’s role without
explicit regularization. We now explore further enhancements during inference with more strategies.

Over-fitting. Although pre-training mitigates over-fitting for synthetic and real noise, the over-
parameterized network may still learn noise patterns over time due to lack of explicit mechanisms
to avoid identity mapping. This is common challenge in many zero-shot models, we suggest early-
stopping [21] (Table 6,“ES” for early-stopping) to avoid over-fitting and reduce inference time.
Additionally, we compare with other over-fitting prevention methods, e.g., TV regularization of
output and augmentation to input image. These approaches either resulted in suboptimal performance
or longer inference times. More details on over-fitting and prevention strategies can be found in Supp.
Sub-sampling. Shown in Sec. 2.4, minimal pixel-shuffle is used to reduce spatial correlation in
real-world noise, but may cause chessboard artifact and reduce performance due to its regular down-
sampling strategy. Better down-sampling strategies have been widely studied, and here we choose
RSG [37] to illustrate, see results at Table 7. For more comparison and visual comparison, see Supp.

B Related Works
B.1 Unsupervised Image Denoising
Unlike supervised approaches [5 –7, 38], unsupervised denoising focuses on situations when paired
data is unavailable. Methods in this category include:
Paired noisy-noisy images. To learn consistent representations from varied noise observations of
the same scene, Lehtinen et al. [8] train on mapping from two noisy observations of the same scene.
Additional approaches utilize synthetic noise to generate noisy pairs, as seen in [48 –52], as well
as [11] learns shared latent from multiple noise observations.
Unpaired noisy-clean images. Duet al. [9] propose to learn decoupled representations of contents
and noise from images. Lin et al. [53] extend this by using separated noise representations to guide
noise synthesis, thereby enhancing the denoising process. Additionally, Wu et al. [54] employ a
distillation loss from both real and synthetic noisy images.
Noisy images only. Techniques like blind-spot [16, 17, 39, 55 –57], substitution followed by image
reconstruction [16, 17], multiple sub-sampled images from a single noisy scene [10] or above
approaches combined [36, 37, 58] are developed when only one observation is available from a noise
scene. Li et al. [59] integrate blind spot strategies and structural insights for adaptive denoising.
Score matching and posterior inference are also utilized in [60, 61].
In the context of zero-shot denoising tasks, only a single noisy image is visible during training,
presenting greater challenges than methods described above.
B.2 Zero-shot Image Denoising
Compared to unsupervised methods, zero-shot denoising is more challenging as it aims to train
a network for denoising when a single noisy image available. Typical strategies involve utilizing
spatial correlations [3, 4], variation based priors [15, 62] or low-frequency characteristics of images,
corrupting and reconstructing part of images [14, 16, 17], or constructing paired training sets from
sub-sampled noisy images [22, 23]. Among which Noise2V oid [16] is initially designed for learning
from multiple noisy images, shows promise in its zero-shot version. Noise2Self [17]reconstructs
cyclically masked regions of input noisy image. Although there is a gap compared to supervised
or unsupervised methods. While dropout-ensemble [14] is adapted on a noisy image for better
performance, it leads to over-smoothing and incurs large computational costs. Noise2Fast [23] and
Zero-Shot Noise2Noise [22] are fast but struggle to completely remove noise from images, especially
spatially-correlated real noise, resulting in suboptimal visual results. DIP [13] and its variants [18,63]
exploits the features of deep networks to learn mappings from random noise to images. Early
stopping [21] or other approaches [20, 64] are used to prevent over-fitting, FasterDIP [19] further
discusses the influence of network structure on its performance. However, current zero-shot methods
often takes a long time, and parameter settings are carefully selected for various image contents and
noise degradation.
B.3 Masked Image Modeling
Masked Image Modeling (MIM) helps in learning pre-trained representations for downstream tasks
by masking a portion of input images [26, 27, 29] and training models to predict the masked contents.
Due to its impressive effects in high-level tasks [30, 31], Masked Image Modeling has also found
1applications in low-level visual tasks. For instance, Wang et al. [65] applies random patch masks
during the pre-training of image deraining and desnowing models in handling adverse weather
conditions. Zheng et al. [66] integrates Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to learn illumination-related
structural information in a supervised low-light enhancement framework. Notably, despite the
successful applications of Masked Image Modeling in several low-level vision tasks, its application
in the pre-training scheme for denoising models has not yet been explored.
C More Details about MPI
C.1 More Details about Iterative Filling
In the main paper, we mention that Iterative Filling is optimization steps based on pre-trained weights
for zero-shot denoising. And as depicted in Sec. 3.3 in main paper, to fully leverage the results
of each optimization step and preserve more image detail, only the masked regions ˆMt⊙ytare
constrained by the loss at each optimization timestep and considered reliable, others are labeled as
“unreliable pixels” and discarded (see Sec. C.2 to know why we need “unreliable pixels”). During the
iterative optimization, we maintain an ensemble version y, assembling reliable parts ˆMt⊙ytof each
prediction ytvia EMA while keeping the rest unchanged, as shown in Fig. 12.
With sufficient iterations, ensemble from each pixel is ensemble from hundreds of predictions,
ensuring a high-quality ensemble outcome.

C.2 Why Discard “Unreliable Pixels”
During the zero-shot denoising process, unmasked parts of each optimization result Mt⊙ytneeded
be discarded, referred to as “unreliable pixels”, primarily due to the following reasons:
1)The pre-training task is set to reconstruct masked regions, that is only masked areas are constrained
for reconstruction, while pixels in unmasked areas significantly differ from the actual pixels in
the image. This discrepancy might result from the skip connections in the network architecture of
DIP [13]. To maximize the utilize of pre-trained weight and avoid conflicting, pixels corresponding
to these unmasked regions should not be considered during optimizing.
2)For spatially uncorrelated noise, we employ an extremely low mask ratio and distinct mask settings
for each color channel to preserve as much image information as possible. In this scenario, it is
impractical to expect the network to retain all pixel values in its output, as this can easily lead to
identity mapping.
3)While partial convolution [67] or others designed for image inpainting can mitigate this problem,
they often lead to sub-optimal performance with risks of over-fitting to noise, and require specialized
network architectures, limiting the adaptability of proposed framework to other network structures.
For our zero-shot denoising framework, which obtains denoised images via iterative optimization,
using a portion of noisy image as cues and training network to complete this "fill-in-the-blank" task
proves most effective. Moreover, the optimization generates reconstructions with various masks in
iterations, assembling these results to achieve final denoised prediction requires only maintaining an
ensemble result additionally, incurring negligible time and space resources.

D Additional Discussion
D.1 Masking Ratio
In the main paper, we discussed the optimal masking ratio for removing spatially uncorrelated
synthetic noise and notes that significantly larger mask ratios are used for real noise. For real spatially
correlated noise, the situation becomes more complex, with no single optimal mask ratio. Based on
experience, the most effective mask range is between 80% ∼95%, which is influenced by the noise’s
spatial correlation, noise intensity, and the information in image.
For the SIDD dataset, we investigated the impact of the masking ratio on SIDD validation, as shown
in Fig. 14, finding that a 90% masking ratio is optimal. This is attributed to SIDD images containing
limited content information and the noise exhibiting strong spatial correlation.
However, the optimal masking ratio for SIDD differs from that for synthetic noise, primarily due
to the spatial correlation of the noise within the image. Synthetic noise is spatially uncorrelated,
meaning noise signals at neighboring positions do not influence each other. In contrast, real noise,
after undergoing a series of ISP processes, exhibits a more complex distribution, resembling blurred
spots rather than independent points (see Fig. 15). For synthetic noise, selecting a small masking
ratio allows for quicker recovery of image details. Conversely, for real noise, a small masking ratio

may lead to the model fitting the noise distribution by relying on neighboring pixel values. In such
cases, a larger masking ratio helps mitigate the influence of noise.
D.2 Over-fitting & Regularization
In the main text, we highlighted that our proposed zero-shot denoising framework still faces over-
fitting issues with increased iteration counts, with Table 8 and Fig. 16 showing this problem’s impact
across more datasets and more regularization. To address this issue, after validation and comparison,
we recommend adopting a simple early-stopping strategy to prevent over-fitting—a straightforward,
effective approach without additional computational costs. We also compared other strategies:
•Employing TV regularization helps against overfitting but still leads to performance drop and
lower peak PSNR as iterations increase.
•Adding random transformations to the input image, including flips and random translations, lead
to steady performance improvement and higher peak PSNR over more iterations, but increase
inference time.
•Early stopping stops close to peak performance with minimal calculation, providing stable,
high-quality results with no added time.

D.3 Down-sampling in Real-world Denoising
As illustrated in Fig. 13, specialized downsampling is employed to reduce the spatial correlation of real
noise, with different downsampling strategies yielding varying outcomes. Simple pixelshuffle (“+PD”)
can easily lead to checkerboard artifacts, whereas more randomized sub-sampling strategies [37]

avoid checkerboard artifacts, as depicted in Fig. 17. A potential issue with this approach is the
over-smoothed denoising predictions. Therefore, downsampling is only applied in strong spatially-
correlated real noise.

E Additional Analysis on Pre-training
E.1 Noise Intensity
In the main text, we have already mentioned that pre-training aids in the removal of various types of
noise. We validated the relationship between pre-trained weights and different input noise intensities
on the CSet dataset, as shown in Fig. 18. Pre-training enhances denoising performance across
different noise levels, particularly in the case of strong noise, where the knowledge provided by
pre-training effectively avoids over-fitting to the noise.
E.2 Masking Ratio
We analyze the impact of pre-training on different paradigms under various masking ratios, as
shown in Fig. 19. Our study reveals that pre-training plays a significant role in enhancing denoising
performance across various masking ratios (especially in cases of 20≤p≤80).
E.3 Discuss of Noise in Pre-training
In the main text, we use the well-known natural image dataset ImageNet without making any
assumptions about the presence or type of noise in each image, hoping to learn the statistical
distribution rules from a large number of natural images. Here, we add synthetic noise of specified
distribution and intensity during pre-training, and perform pre-training from noise to itself (denoted
as “+Gauss ( σ=25) (N2N)”), and adopt the same iterative denoising strategy, proving that additional
assumptions about specific noise type or noise level in pre-training leads to a decline in effectiveness,
as shown in Table. 9. Networks that are too small fail to learn sufficient denoising information, falling
short of the corresponding zero-shot approaches.

F Extension to other network structures
In the main text, we discuss the effect of pre-training on the proposed model using the same network
architecture as DIP [13]. We are curious whether this prior knowledge could be applied to other
model architectures. Here, we compare the impact of pre-training under different model settings.
Specifically, we evaluate the removal of Gaussian noise with sigma=25 on CSet using three additional
network architectures (DnCNN [5], ResNet [68]), as shown in Table 10. The pre-training approach
consistently brings performance gains across various network architectures.

Specifically, for DIP-SURE, we report both peak performance and the performance at the final
iteration. Since DIP-SURE is specifically designed for Gaussian and Poisson noise, and requires
the input of Gaussian noise variance, for real-world denoising tasks we provide estimated variance
from paired data, to report the best performance. For diffusion-based methods, which are trained
exclusively on Gaussian noise and also require variance as prior, we use the same variance estimation
approach to report their best results. For self-supervised methods, which can be easily adapted to a
single image with minimal changes, we follow their original settings. In each iteration, we crop eight
same-size patches from the noisy image to form a batch, and perform inference on the full image
every 10 iterations, and combine denoised images using the same ensemble strategy as our method
for fairness.
We observe that DIP-SURE, due to its priors on noise type and variance, performs slightly better
than our method under Gaussian noise settings. However, its performance significantly drops when
dealing with real noise, especially when reporting the last performance. Since diffusion models are
inherently Gaussian denoisers, they perform well on Gaussian noise when the variance is known, but
also face challenges with real noise. The modified blind-spot network-based methods can handle
severe real noise relatively well, but they may suffer from potential image detail loss and require long
inference times.
G.3 Ensemble results of N2V and N2S
In the main text, we present versions of DIP [13] and FasterDIP [19] with EMA (Exponential Moving
Average) ensembles, as these processes are included in their source codes. To provide additional
information for comparison, we also adapted N2V* [16] and N2S* [17] to their corresponding EMA
ensemble versions, as shown in Table 13, 14, 15. Generally, the ensemble versions of these methods
can improve the PSNR by 1 ∼2 dB. However, even though the enhanced N2V may outperform our
Faster version in some cases, it does not affect the performance comparison with our β=0.99 version,
which remains the best. Moreover, our β=0.99 version achieves this with less than half the inference
time required by these methods.

G.4 Details of Unseen Noise
Gaussian Noise. Gaussian noise follows a normal distribution and is commonly encountered in
digital imaging, especially during sensor data acquisition and transmission. It represents random
variations in intensity and color information in images, making it a fundamental noise model in image
processing. For each element in clean image I[k], is represented by:
ˆI[k]=I[k]+σ·N[k], (9)
where N[k]represents random variable sampled from a standard normal distribution, which is
characterized by its standard deviation ( σ).
Poisson Noise. Poisson noise is prevalent in scenarios with low-light conditions, such as astronomical
imaging or medical imaging, where the photon count is inherently random and follows a Poisson
distribution. Poisson noise models the variation of intensity based on a Poisson distribution, is
generally expressed as:
ˆI[k]=P(I[k]·λ)/λ, (10)
where λindicates the event rate, and P(·)denotes random variable generated from Poisson distribu-
tion.
Noise Level Function (NLF). Noise level function, also referred to as heteroscedastic gaussian
model [69], is commonly described by a varying standard deviation across the image. This type of
noise is widely used to express the read-shot noise in camera imaging pipeline, where different parts
of the image exhibit different noise levels. It is typically modeled as:
ˆI[k]∼ N(µ=I[k], σ2=σr+σs·I[k]) (11)
where σrandσrrepresent different standard deviations in distinct regions of the image. Noise
parameter calibrated for [40] in work [70] obeys a log-linear rule:
log(σr) = 2 .18·log(σs) + 1.2 (12)
We choose σs∈[0.01,0.012] to better illustrate the generality.
Speckle Noise. Speckle noise is an interference pattern produced by the coherent processing of a
signal, especially in active radar and ultrasound imaging. This noise is particularly common in radar
and ultrasound images, where it can significantly degrade the quality of the image. Its mathematical
representation is:
ˆI[k]=I[k]+I[k]·U[k], (13)
where U[k]is sampled from uniform distribution with mean 0 and vrepresenting the standard deviation
of the noise.

Salt-and-Pepper Noise (S&P). Salt-and-Pepper noise, also known as impulse noise, is characterized
by sharp and sudden disturbances in an image signal. It’s typically represented as sparse white and
black pixels, hence the name. This noise can be caused by sharp and sudden disturbances in the
image signal, often due to transmission errors, faulty memory locations, or timing errors in digital
image sensors. Its mathematical representation is:
ˆI[k]=I[k]+S[k]−S[k], (14)
where S[k]andP[k]represents salt and pepper noise, respectively. For each of them are Bernoulli
sample with probability dofImax/Iminand probability 1−dof 0, which makes the probability
total affected is 2·d.
G.5 Additional Computational Costs
In analyzing the performance of deep learning models, it’s crucial to consider both the Floating Point
Operations (FLOPs) and the model parameters. FLOPs give us an insight into the computational
complexity of the model, which affects inference time and resource utilization, while the number
of parameters indicates its capacity to learn and adapt to complex data patterns. A balance between
these two aspects is essential for efficient and effective model performance. Our analysis, as reflected
in the comparison between Table 16, demonstrates that our method successfully achieves this balance.
It maintains computational efficiency without compromising the model’s ability to accurately process
and analyze data, an essential factor for practical application in varied computational environments.
G.6 Zero-shot Denoising on More Image Types
In the main text, we demonstrate the ability of proposed MPI to generalize to other types of images
through a medical imaging dataset. Further here, we explore new types of images, including a
microscopy imaging dataset BioSR [71] and extremely low-light dataset SID [72]. See Fig. 21 and
Fig. 22 for qualitative examples.

Figure 22: For extremely low-light images, there is serious color bias in the expected denoising result
(a) and captured noisy image (b). This color bias is still retained in the denoising result, but the noise
is basically removed. This is discussed in Sec. H.2.
H Concluding Remarks
In this study, we introduce Masked Pre-train then Iterative fill (MPI), a zero-shot denoising paradigm
utilizing pre-trained model with random masks on natural images. The pre-trained weights is opti-
mized on a specific noisy image through Iterative filling process, and predictions with corresponding
masks during inference is combined for enhanced quality and faster inference.
H.1 Broader impacts
From the perspective of our work, we have pioneered the use of generalizable knowledge from
natural images without any assumptions about noise degradation, offering an efficient framework
for handling diverse synthetic and real noises with significantly reduced inference time, which is
a critical issue in zero-shot denoising and makes their practical applications feasible. Notably, our
zero-shot method excels in generalization compared to current supervised and unsupervised methods,
offering new insights into denoising.
H.2 Limitations
Although proposed MPI has shown effects in removal of various types of noises, the mask-based
noise-supervised denoising setting does not seem to allow the removal of non-zero mean noise. So
when dealing with extremely low-light images with severe color bias, the color bias still remains
after denoising; this is a common problem in zero-shot denoising, because there is no prior regarding
noise-clean image pair in specific domain, but it may limit several practical applications, and we are
currently trying to solve this problem in other ways.

Fig. 31) and denoising real noise data (Fig. 32 - Fig. 35).

21NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in
the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contri-
butions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer
to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much
the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are
not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the
paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model
well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should
reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications
would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a
complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA] .
22Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well
by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the
code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to
make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might
suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be
necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset,
or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way
to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for
how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language
model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research
performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of
the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case
of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way
(e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some
path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions
to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
23Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to
access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions
(if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper)
is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparame-
ters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run
with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to
a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
24•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality
of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they
were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the
experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration
due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact
or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g.,
deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups),
privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point
out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate
deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic
algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate
Deepfakes faster.
25•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or
unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mecha-
nisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback
over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release
of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image
generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly
respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service
of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated
licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
26•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset
is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as
details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution
of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in
the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or
an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were
obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should
clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines
for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
