Abstract
Diffusion-based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) is renowned for generating percep-
tually realistic videos, yet it grapples with maintaining detail consistency across
frames due to stochastic fluctuations. The traditional approach of pixel-level align-
ment is ineffective for diffusion-processed frames because of iterative disruptions.
To overcome this, we introduce SeeClear–a novel VSR framework leveraging
conditional video generation, orchestrated by instance-centric and channel-wise
semantic controls. This framework integrates a Semantic Distiller and a Pixel Con-
denser, which synergize to extract and upscale semantic details from low-resolution
frames. The Instance- Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) utilizes video-clip-wise
tokens to dynamically relate pixels within and across frames, enhancing coherency.
Additionally, the Channel-wise Texture A ggregation Mem ory(CaTeGory) infuses
extrinsic knowledge, capitalizing on long-standing semantic textures. Our method
also innovates the blurring diffusion process with the ResShift mechanism, finely
balancing between sharpness and diffusion effects. Comprehensive experiments
confirm our framework’s advantage over state-of-the-art diffusion-based VSR tech-
niques. The code is available: https://github.com/Tang1705/SeeClear-NeurIPS24.
1 Introduction
Video super-resolution (VSR) is a challenging low-level vision task that involves improving the
resolution and visual quality of the given low-resolution (LR) observations and maintaining the
temporal coherence of high-resolution (HR) components. Various deep-learning-based VSR ap-
proaches [ 1,3,30,17,13,20,21] explore effective inter-frame alignment to reconstruct satisfactory
sequences. Despite establishing one new pole after another in the quantitative results, they struggle to
generate photo-realistic textures.
With the explosion of diffusion model (DM) in visual generation [ 10,31,26], super-resolution (SR)
from the generative perspective also garners the broad attention [ 28,29,45,5]. DM breaks the
generation process into sequential sub-processes and iteratively samples semantic-specific images
from Gaussian noise, equipped with a paired forward diffusion process and reverse denoising process.
The former progressively injects varied intensity noise into the image along a Markov chain to
simulate diverse image distributions. The latter leverages a denoising network to generate an image
based on the given noise and conditions. Early efforts directly apply the generation paradigm to
super-resolution, overlooking its characteristic while generating pleasing content, thus trapping in
huge sampling overhead.

that dominates the early stages of diffusion is contained in the LR priors, while SR tends to focus on
generating high-frequency details [ 33,15]. Besides, the loss of high-frequency information in LR
videos stems from the limited sensing range of imaging equipment. As a result, solely disrupting
frames with additive noise is inadequate to depict the degradation of HR videos [ 9]. Moreover,
prevalent VSR methods employ delicate inter-frame alignment (e.g., optical flow or deformable
convolution) to fuse the sub-pixel information across adjacent frames. However, the disturbed pixels
pose a severe challenge to these methods, rendering the accuracy to deteriorate in the pixel space.

Figure 1: The sketch of SeeClear. It consists of a Seman-
tic Distiller and a Pixel Condenser, which are responsible
for distilling instance-centric semantics from LR frames
and generating HR frames. The instance-centric and
assembled channel-wise semantics act as thermometer
to control the condition for generation.To alleviate the above issue, we introduce
SeeClear , an innovative diffusion model em-
powering distilled semantics to enhan ce the
pixelcond ensation for video super- resolution.
During the forward diffusion process, the low-
pass filter is applied within the patch, gradually
diminishing the high-frequency component, all
while the residual is progressively shifted in the
frequency domain to transform the HR frames to
corresponding LR versions step by step. To re-
duce the computational overhead, the intermedi-
ate states are decomposed into various frequency
sub-bands via 2D discrete wavelet transform and
subsequently processed by the attention-based
U-Net. Furthermore, we devise a dual semantic-
controlled conditional generation schema to en-
hance the temporal coherence of VSR. Specifi-
cally, a segmentation framework for open vocab-
ulary is employed to distill instance-centric se-
mantics from LR frames. They serve as prompts,
enabling the Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) to highlight and associate semantically
related pixels within the local temporal scope. Besides, abundant semantic cues in channel dimensions
are also explored to form an extensional memory dubbed Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory
(CaTeGory). It aids in global temporal coherence and boosts performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
In summary, the main contributions of this work are as follows:
•We present SeeClear, a diffusion-based framework for video super-resolution that distills semantic
priors from low-resolution frames for spatial modulation and temporal association, controlling the
condition of pixel generation.
•We reformulate the diffusion process by integrating residual shifting with patch-level blurring, and
introduce an attention-based architecture to explore valuable information among wavelet spectra
during the sampling process, incorporating feature modulation of intra-frame semantics.
•We devise a dual semantic distillation schema that extracts instance-centric semantics of each
frame and further assembles them into texture memory based on the semantic category of channel
dimension, ensuring both short-term and long-term temporal coherence.
2 Related Work
2.1 Video Super-Resolution
Prominent video super-resolution techniques concentrate on leveraging sub-pixel information across
frames to enhance performance. EDVR [ 37] employs cascading deformable convolution layers
(DCN) for inter-frame alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner, tackling large amplitude video motion.
BasicVSR [ 1] comprehensively explores each module’s role in VSR and delivers a simple yet effective
framework by reusing previous designs with slight modifications. Given the similarity between DCN
and optical flow, BasicVSR++ [ 3] devises flow-guided deformable alignment, exploiting the offset
diversity of DCN without instability during the training. VRT [ 16] combines mutual attention with
self-attention, which is respectively in charge of inter-frame alignment and information preservation.
2RVRT [ 17] extends this by incorporating optical flow with deformable attention, aligning and fusing
features directly at non-integer locations clip-to-clip. PSRT [ 30] reassesses prevalent alignment meth-
ods in transformer-based VSR and implements patch alignment to counteract inaccuracies in motion
estimation and compensation. DFVSR [ 8] represents video with the proposed directional frequency
representation, amalgamating object motion into multiple directional frequencies, augmented with a
frequency-based implicit alignment, thus enhancing alignment.
2.2 Diffusion-Based Super-Resolution
Building on the success of diffusion models in the realm of image generation [ 10,31,26,25,48],
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is advancing. SR3 [ 28], a pioneering approach, iteratively
samples an HR image from Gaussian noise conditioned on the LR image. In contrast, StableSR [ 36]
applies diffusion-based SR in a low-dimensional latent space using the pre-trained auto-encoder to
reduce computation and generate improved results through the generative priors contained in weights
of Latent Diffusion. ResDiff [ 29] combines a lightweight CNN with DM to restore low-frequency
and predict high-frequency components, and ResShift [ 45] redefines the initial step as a blend of the
low-resolution image and random noise to boost efficiency. Applying a different approach, DiWa [ 23]
migrates the diffusion process into the wavelet spectrum to effectively hallucinate high-frequency
information. Upscale-A-Video [ 49], for video super-resolution, introduces temporal layers into the
U-Net and V AE-Decoder and deploys a flow-guided recurrent latent propagation module to ensure
temporal coherence and overall video stability when applying image-wise diffusion model.
2.3 Semantic-Assisted Restoration
Traditionally seen as a preparatory step for subsequent tasks [ 50,12], restoration is now reformulated
with the assistance of semantics. SFT [ 38] utilizes semantic segmentation probability maps for
spatial modulation of intermediate features in the SR network, yielding more realistic textures.
SKF [ 40] supports low-light image enhancement model to learn diverse priors encapsulated in a
semantic segmentation model by semantic-aware embedding module paired with semantic-guided
losses. SeD [ 14] integrates semantics into the discriminator of GAN-based SR for fine-grained
texture generation rather than solely learning coarse-grained distribution. CoSeR [ 32] bridges image
appearance and language understanding to empower SR with global cognition buried in LR image,
regarding priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model and a high-resolution reference image as
powerful conditions. SeeSR [ 39] analyzes several types of semantic prompts and opts tag-style
semantics to harness the generative potential of the T2I model for real SR. Semantic Lens [ 34]
forgoes pixel-level inter-frame alignment and distills diverse semantics for temporal association in
the instance-centric semantic space, attaining better performance.
3 Methodology
Given a low-resolution (LR) video sequence of Nframes ILR
i∈RN×C×H×W, where iis the frame
index, H×Wrepresents spatial dimensions, and Cstands for the channel of frame, SeeClear aims to
exploit rich semantic priors to generate the high-resolution (HR) video IHR
i∈RN×C×sH×sW, with
sas the upscaling factor. In the iterative paradigm of the diffusion model, HR frames are corrupted
according to handcrafted transition distribution at each diffusion step ( t= 1,2,···, T). And a
U-shaped network is employed to estimate the posterior distribution using LR frames as condition
during reverse generation. As illustrated in Figure 1, it consists of a Semantic Distiller and a Pixel
Condenser, respectively responsible for semantic extraction and texture generation.
The LR video is initially split into non-overlapping clips composed of mframes for parallel processing.
Semantic Distiller, a pre-trained network for open-vocabulary segmentation, distills semantics related
to both instances and background clip by clip, denoted as instance-centric semantics. Pixel Condenser
is an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder extracts multi-scale features
under the control of LR frames, and the decoder generates HR frames from coarse to fine. They are
also bridged via skip connections to transmit high-frequency information at the same resolution. To
maximize the network’s generative capacity, instance-centric semantics are utilized as conditions for
individual frame generation in the decoder. They also serve as the cues of inter-frame alignment for
temporal coherence within the video clip and further cluster into a semantic-texture memory along
channel dimension for consistency across clips.
33.1 Blurring ResShift
During the video capturing, frequencies exceeding the imaging range of the device are truncated,
leading to the loss of high-frequency information in LR videos. Therefore, an intuition is to construct
a Markov chain between HR frames and LR frames in the frequency domain. Inspired by blurring
diffusion [ 11], the forward diffusion process of SeeClear initializes with the approximate distribution
of HR frames. It then iterates and terminates with the approximate distribution of LR frames using a
Gaussian kernel convolution in frequency space facilitated by the Discrete Cosine Transformation
(DCT). Considering the correlation of neighboring information, blurring is conducted within a local
patch instead of the whole image. The above process is formulated as:
q(ut|u0) =N(ut|Dtu0, ηtE), t∈ {1,···, T}, (1)
u0=VTIHR
i, (2)
where u0andutdenote HR frames and intermediate states in the frequency space for brevity.
VTdenotes the projection matrix of DCT. Dt=eΛtis diagonal blurring matrix with Λx×p+y=
−π2(x2
p2+y2
p2)for coordinate (x, y)within patch of size p×p, and ηtis the variance of noise. Eis
the identity matrix.
In the realm of generation, the vanilla destruction process progressively transforms the image into
pure Gaussian noise, leading to numerous sampling steps and tending to be suboptimal for VSR.
An alternative way is to employ a transition kernel that shifts residuals between HR and LR frames,
accompanied by patch-level blurring. The forward diffusion process is formulated as:
q(ut|u0,ul) =N 
ut|Dtu0+ηtet, κ2ηtE
, t∈ {1,···, T}, (3)
et=ul−Dtu0, (4)
where uldenotes LR frames transformed into the frequency space. etindicates the residuals between
LR and blurred HR frames at time step t.ηtrepresents the shifting sequence and κis a hyper-
parameter determining the intensity of noise. Upon this, SeeClear can yield HR frames by estimating
the posterior distribution p(u0|ul)in the reverse sampling progress, formulated as:
p(u0|ul) =Z
p(uT|ul)TY
t=1pθ(ut−1|ut,ul) du1:T, (5)
p(uT|ul)≈ N 
uT|ul, κ2E
, (6)
where pθ(ut−1|ut,ul)represents the inverse transition kernel restoring uttout−1.θdenotes
learnable parameters of attention-based U-Net.
To alleviate the computational overhead, preceding methods introduce an autoencoder to transform
pixel-level images in the perceptually equivalent space, concentrating on the semantic composition and
bypassing the impedance of high-frequency details. However, the loss of high-frequency information
during encoding is hard to recover in the decoding and will deteriorate the visual quality. Therefore,
we forgo the autoencoding method in SeeClear and incorporate discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
in the diffusion process. Specifically, the HR and LR frames are recursively decomposed into four
sub-bands:
IHR
ll, IHR
lh, IHR
hl, IHR
hh= DWT 2D 
IHR
i
, (7)
where IHR
lldenotes the low-frequency approximation, IHR
lh,IHR
hlandIHR
hhcorrespond to horizontal,
vertical and diagonal high-frequency details. DWT 2D(·)represents the 2D Discrete Wavelet Trans-
form (DWT). After kdecompositions, each of them possesses a size ofH
2k×W
2k. These coefficients
are contacted along the channel dimension and serve in the diffusion process. The rationale behind
employing DWT as a substitute is two-fold. Firstly, it enables the U-Net to perform on a small
spatial size without information loss. Secondly, it benefits from the U-Net scaling [ 44] hindered
by additional parameters of the autoencoding network. To make full use of DWT, window-based
self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention is stacked as the basic unit of U-Net, in charge
of the correlation of intra-sub-bands and inter-sub-bands, respectively.

tion features to bridge the pixel-level information and instance-centric semantic tokens. And then,
the semantic-aware features can be aligned in the semantic space based on their semantic relevance.
3.2 Instance-Centric Alignment within Video Clips
Due to the destruction of the diffusion process, pixel-level inter-frame alignment, such as optical
flow, is no longer applicable. With the premise of semantic embedding, we devise the Instance-
Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) within video clips, as illustrated in Figure 2. It establishes
temporal association in the semantic space instead of intensity similarity among frames, avoiding the
interference of noise and blurriness. Specifically, Semantic Distiller predicts a set of image features
Fimgand text embedding Ftxtfrom LR frames and predefined vocabulary V. After that, the kimage
features with the highest similarity to the text embedding are retained, including token-level semantic
priors and pixel-level segmentation features from LR frames. The above procedure is formulated as:
Fimg, Ftxt=S 

where S(·)represents Semantic Distiller. topk(·)andSim (·)denote the operations of selecting
theklargest items and calculating the similarity respectively. OiandPiare semantic tokens and
segmentation features, in which the former represents high-level semantics and can locate related
pixels in the segmentation features. The segmentation features contain both semantics and low-
level structural information, which is suitable for bridging the semantics and features of the Pixel
Condenser. It is utilized to generate spatial modulation pairs prepared for semantic embedding,
formulated as:
(γ, β) =G(Pi), (10)
Fi= (fi⊙γ+β) +fi, (11)
where γandβrepresent scale and bias for modulation. fiandFicorrespond to original and modulated
features. Gdenotes two convolutional layers followed by a ReLU activation. “ ⊙” represents the
Hadamard product. After that, InCAM embeds semantics into modulated features based on multi-head
cross-attention, yielding semantic-embedded features ˆFi:

WQ,WKandWVrepresent the linear projections, and dis the dimension of projected matri-
ces.SoftMax ( ·)denotes the SoftMax operation. To benefit from the adjacent supporting frames,
it is necessary to establish semantic associations among frames. The frame-wise semantic tokens
are further fed into the instance encoder-decoder for communicating semantics along the temporal
5dimension, generating clip-wise semantic tokens. It gathers all the information of the same semantic
object within a clip and serves as the guide for inter-frame alignment. Specifically, InCAM combines
semantic guidance and enhanced features to activate the related pixels across frames and utilizes
multi-frame self-attention for parallel alignment and fusion. The above procedure is formulated as:
Oc= Dec

the extended version of self-attention in video. ¯Fiis aligned feature. The product of semantics and
enhanced features is akin to the class activation mapping, which highlights the most similar pixels in

Figure 3: The illustration of Channel-wise
Texture Aggregation Memory (CaTeGory). It
assembles the textures based on the semantic
class along the channel dimension.Due to the limited size of the temporal window, the per-
formance of clip-wise mutual information enhancement
in long video sequences is unsatisfactory, which could
lead to inconsistent content. To stabilize video content
and enhance visual texture, the Channel-wise Texture
Aggregation Mem ory(CaTeGory) is constructed to cluster
abundant textures according to channel-wise semantics,
as graphically depicted in Figure 3. It is comprised of
the channel-wise semantic and the corresponding texture.
Specifically, channels of instance-centric semantics also
contain distinguishing traits, which are assembled and
divided into different groups to form the channel-wise
semantic. Concurrently, hierarchical features from the
decoder of the Pixel Condenser are clustered into the cor-
responding semantic group to portray the textures. The
connection between them is established in a manner sim-
ilar to the position embedding in the attention mechanism.
The above process can be formulated as:
(Cj, Tj) =M
¯Cj,¯Tj,¯Fi,k	4
k=1
, (16)
where ¯Fi,kis the features benefited from adjacent frames of k-th layer. ¯Cjand¯Tjrespectively denote
channel-wise semantics and textures of j-th group, which are zero-initialized as network parameters.
They are iteratively updated towards the final version (i.e., CjandTj) by injecting external knowledge
from the whole dataset and previous clips. And M(·)represents the construction of CaTeGory. It
concatenates the multi-scale features and incorporates them into channel-wise semantics and textures:
ˆTj=¯Cj×¯Tj, (17)
Tj= SA

k=1
, (18)
where ˆTjis the textures embedded channel-wise semantics. SA (·)andCA (·)indicate multi-head
self-attention and cross-attention. The layer normalization and feed-forward network are omitted for
brevity. It bridges the channel-wise semantics and textures via matrix multiplication and further fuses
high-value information from the pyramid feature, delivering augmented semantic-texture pairs. The
hierarchical features not only provide rich structural information but also carry relatively abstract
amid features in order to benefit different decoder layers more effectively. At each layer, the prior
knowledge stored in CaTeGory is firstly queried by the clip-wise semantics along channel dimension
and aggregated for feature enhancement of the current clip, which is formulated as:
Aj= SoftMax 

˜Fi= CA ¯Fi,AjTj
+¯Fi, (20)
6where Ajdepicts the similarity between the clip-wise semantics and items of CaTeGory along
channel dimensions, and ˜Fiis the refined features as input of the next layer. As mentioned before,
semantic-texture pairs are optimized as parts of the network during the training stage, absorbing ample
priors from the whole dataset. In the sampling process, the update mechanism is reused to integrate
the long-term information of video into memory to improve the super-resolution of subsequent clips.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets To assess the effectiveness of the proposed SeeClear, we employ two commonly used
datasets for training: REDS [ 24] and Vimeo-90K [ 41]. The REDS dataset, characterized by its
realistic and dynamic scenes, consists of three subsets used for training and testing. In accordance
with the conventions established in previous works [ 1,3], we select four clips2from the training
dataset to serve as a validation dataset, referred to as REDS4. The Vid4 [ 19] dataset is used as
the corresponding test dataset for Vimeo-90K. The LR sequences are degraded through bicubic
downsampling (BI), with a downsampling factor of 4×.
Implementation Details The pre-trained OpenSeeD [ 46] is opted as the semantic distiller with frozen
weights, while all learnable parameters are contained in the pixel condenser. And the schedulers of
blur and noise in the diffusion process follow the settings of IHDM [ 25] and ResShift [ 45]. During
the training, the pixel condenser is first trained to generate an HR clip with 5frames under the control
of instance-centric semantics. And then, Channel-wise Texture Memory is independently trained
to inject valuable textures from the whole dataset and be capable of fusing long-term information.
Finally, the whole network is jointly fine-tuned. All training stages utilize the Adam optimizer with
β1= 0.5andβ2= 0.999, where the learning rate decays with the cosine annealing scheme. The
Charbonnier loss [ 4] is applied on the whole frames between the ground truth and the reconstructed
frame, formulated as L=p
||IHR
i−ISR
i||2+ϵ2. The SeeClear framework is implemented with
PyTorch-2.0 and trained across 4 NVIDIA 4090 GPUs, each accommodating 4 video clips.
Evaluation Metrics Comparative analysis is conducted among different VSR methods, with the
evaluation being anchored on both pixel-based and perception-oriented metrics. Peak Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are utilized to evaluate the quantitative
performance as pixel-based metrics. All of them are calculated based on the Y-channel, with the
exception of the REDS4, for which the RGB-channel is used. On the perceptual side, Learned
Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [ 47] is elected for assessment from the perspective of
human visual preference. It leverages a VGG model to extract features from the generated HR video
and the ground truth, subsequently measuring the extent of similarity between these features.
4.2 Comparisons with State-of-the-Art Methods
We compare SeeClear with several state-of-the-art methods, including regression-based and diffusion-
based ones. As shown in Table 3, SeeClear achieves superior perceptual quality compared to
regression-based methods despite slightly underperforming in pixel-based metrics. We also provide
an extended version, which leverages the generative capability of SeeClear to enhance the features
of the regression-based model, akin to references such as [ 6,2]. An observable increase in fidelity
is accompanied by a notable further improvement in the perceptual metrics of the reconstructed
results. Similar performance trends can be noted on Vid4 as those on REDS4. In particular, SeeClear
achieves an LPIPS score of 0.1548, marking a relative improvement of 10.8% compared to the top
competitor, SATeCo [ 6]. When pitted against a variant of SATeCo, which is not modulated by LR
videos, SeeClear demonstrates a higher PSNR value with a comparable LPIPS score. It suggests that
SeeClear benefits from the control of dual semantics, striking a balance between superior fidelity and
the generation of realistic textures.
As visualized in Figure 4, SeeClear showcases its ability to restore textures with high fidelity more
effectively compared with other methods. Despite large blurriness, SeeClear still demonstrates
robust restoration capabilities for video super-resolution, reinforcing the efficacy of utilizing instance-
specific and channel-wise semantic priors for video generation control. To further substantiate

in Figure 5. ResShift synthesizes varied visual contents across two frames, such as the fluctuating
figures on the license plate. Contrarily, HR frames generated via SeeClear maintain a higher temporal
consistency and deliver pleasing textures.
4.3 Ablation Study
To assess the contribution of each component within the proposed SeeClear, we begin with a baseline
model and gradually integrate these modules. Specifically, all semantic-related operations are
bypassed, retaining solely spatial and channel self-attention and residual blocks, degenerating into a
diffusion-based image SR model without any condition. Subsequently, we incrementally introduce
the crafted semantic-conditional module into the baseline and formulate several variants. Their results
are listed in Table 2 and partially visualized in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Visual comparisons of ablation for investigat-
ing the contribution of key modules.First, the intra-frame semantic condition brings
about 1.5% improvements in LPIPS. Albeit the
multi-frame self-attention further improves the
perceptual quality, it also impairs the fidelity of
the restored video. Under the control of InCAM,
SeeClear can correlate semantically consistent
pixels in adjacent frames by combining intra-
frame and inter-frame semantic priors, elevating
the PSNR from 27.99 dB to 28.46 dB, and bring-
ing about 6.6% improvements in LPIPS. Further-
more, upon integrating the semantic priors from
CaTeGory, the fully-fledged SeeClear notably
enhances both the pixel-based and perception-
oriented metrics simultaneously. It indicates that the cooperative control of semantics is more
beneficial for generating videos of higher fidelity and better perceptual quality. As illustrated in
Figure 6, the baseline struggles to restore tiny and fine patterns without semantic condition, and it
gradually gains improvement accompanied by the strengthening of semantic control.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we present a novel diffusion-based video super-resolution framework named SeeClear.
It formulates the diffusion process by incorporating residual shifting mechanism and patch-level
blurring, constructing a Markov chain initiated with high-resolution frames and terminated at low-
resolution frames. It employs a semantic distiller and a pixel condenser for super-resolution during the
inverse sampling process. The instance-centric semantics distilled by the semantic distiller prompts
spatial modulation and temporal association in the devised Instance-Centric Alignment Module.
They are further assembled into Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory, providing abundant
conditions for temporal coherence and realistic content.

12A Mathematical Details
Patch-level Blurring Diffusion. Blurring Diffusion [ 11] designs the destruction process based on
heat dissipation [ 25] that retains low-frequency components of images over high frequencies. It
describes the thermodynamic process in which the temperature u(x, y, t )changes at position (x, y)
in a 2D plane with respect to the time tvia a partial differential equation:
∂
∂tu(x, y, t ) = ∆u(x, y, t ), t∈ {1,···, T}, (21)
where ∆ =∇2denotes the Laplace operator. Based on Neumann boundary conditions ( ∂u/∂x =
∂u/∂y = 0) with zero-derivatives at the boundaries of the image, the solution is given by a diagonal
matrix in the frequency domain of the discrete cosine transform:
ut=eΛtu0, t∈ {1,···, T}, (22)
where u0is the initial state and Λis a diagonal matrix with negative squared frequencies on the
diagonal. It is equivalent to a convolution with a Gaussian kernel with variance σ2
blur= 2tin the
realm of image processing. Blurring Diffusion further mixes Gaussian noise with variance σ2
tinto
the blurring process to incorporate stochasticity into deterministic dissipation.
Patch-level blurring diffusion conducts the blurring process within a patch with the size of p×pto
make all pixel intensity the same instead of the whole image, which means Λx×p+y=−π2(x2
p2+y2
p2).
More generally, it can be extended with any invertible transformation, corresponding to the marginal
distribution in the pixel space:

where RandR−1represent invertible transformation and corresponding inverse transformation.
diag (·)denotes the operation that projects a vector to a diagonal matrix. αtandβtare specific
schedules for mean and noise.
Blurring ResShift. ResShift [ 45] introduces a monotonically increasing sequence {ηt}T
t=1to
gradually shift residual between low-resolution image and high-resolution one, whose marginal
distribution is defined as:
q 
It
i|I0
i, ILR

It
i|I0
i+ηte0, κ2ηtE
, t∈ {1,···, T}, (24)
where e0is the residuals between low-resolution and high-resolution frames. ηtcontrols the speed
of residual shifting and satisfies η1→0andηT→1. After incorporation of patch-level blurring
diffusion and ResShift, utcan be sampled via
ut=eΛtu0+ηtet+κ√ηtϵt⇔ut= (1−ηt)eΛtu0+ηtul+κ√ηtϵt, (25)
et=ul−Dtu0⇔et=ul−eΛtu0, (26)
where ϵt∼ N (u|0,E). Thus, the relation between utandut−1can be obtained:
ˆu0=ut−1−ηt−1ul
(1−ηt−1)eΛ(t−1), (27)
ut=1−ηt
1−ηt−1eΛ(ut−1−ηt−1ul) +ηtul+κ√αtϵt, (28)
where αt=ηt−ηt−1.ˆu0is approximate HR frame. By recursively applying the sampling procedure
and reparameterization trick, we can rewrite the marginal distribution of Blurring ResShift as follows:
q(ut|u0,ul) =N 
ut|Dtu0+ηtet, κ2ηtE
, t∈ {1,···, T}, (29)
According to Bayes’s theorem, there is
q(ut−1|ut,u0,ul)∝q(ut|ut−1,ul)q(ut−1|u0,ul), (30)
where
q(ut|ut−1,ul) =N

B Rational Explanation
We analyze the final states of different diffusion processes via the power spectral density, which
reflects the distribution of frequency content in an image, as illustrated in Figure 4. It can be observed
that IHDM performs blurring globally and has a significant difference in frequency distribution
compared to the LR image, while the patch-level blurring is closer to the frequency distribution of
the LR. On this basis, SeeClear further introduces residual and noise. Compared to ResShift without
blurring, the diffusion process adopted by SeeClear makes the image more consistent with the LR in
the low-frequency components and introduces more randomness in the high-frequency components,
compelling the model to focus on the generation of high-frequency components.

Pixel Condenser
Figure 8: The illustration of SeeClear. It comprises the diffusion process incorporating patch-level
blurring and residual shift mechanism and a reverse process. During the reverse process, Semantic
Distiller for semantic embedding extraction and U-shaped Pixel Condenser are employed for iterative
denoising. The devised InCAM and CaTeGory are inserted into the U-Net to utilize the diverse
semantics for inter-frame alignment in the diffusion-based VSR framework.
SeeClear consists of a forward diffusion process and a reverse process for VSR. In the diffusion
process, patch-level blurring and residual shift mechanism are integrated to degrade HR frames
based on the handcrafted time schedule. During the reverse process, a transformer-based network
for open vocabulary segmentation and a U-Net are employed for iterative denoising. The former is
responsible for extracting semantic embeddings related to instances from LR videos, similar to the
process of distillation in physics, and is therefore named the semantic distiller. The latter is utilized
to filter out interfering noise and retain valuable information from low-quality frames, similar to the
condensation process. All of them are tailored for image processing, and SeeClear takes diverse
semantic embeddings as conditions to enable the network to be aware of the generated content and
determine the aligned pixels from adjacent frames for the temporal consistency of the whole video.
As depicted in Figure 8, the attention-based Pixel Condenser primarily consists of three parts,
i.e., encoder, decoder, and middle block. As the input of the encoder, low-resolution frames are
concatenated with the intermediate states and processed through a convolution layer. The encoder
incorporates a window-based self-attention and channel-wise self-attention, alternating between two
residual blocks. These attention operations mine valuable information within and across the wavelet
sub-bands, and the residual blocks infuse the features with the intensity of degradation. Following
this, a wavelet-based downsample layer is deployed for feature downsampling.
Specifically, the features are decomposed into various sub-bands via a 2D discrete wavelet transform,
reducing the spatial dimensions while keeping the original data intact. Low-frequency features are
further fed into the subsequent layer of the encoder, while others are transmitted to the corresponding
wavelet-based upsample layer in the decoder via a skip connection. Additionally, the wavelet-based
downsample layers are utilized parallel along the encoder, refilling the downsampled features with
information derived from the low-resolution frames.
The devised Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) and Channel-wise Texture Aggregation
Memory (CaTeGory) are inserted into both the middle and decoder. Firstly, the InCAM spatially
modulates the features based on instance-centric semantics and aligns adjacent frames within the
clip in semantic space. Spatial self-attention employs these aligned features, substituting the original
features as input. Subsequently, features enhanced through channel-wise self-attention are embedded
as queries to seek assistance from the CaTeGory. Furthermore, the wavelet-based upsample layer
accepts features from the decoder and high-frequency information transmitted from the encoder. It
reinfuses the lost information from the encoder while scaling the feature size. The network concludes
with a convolution layer refining the features, which are added to the interpolated frames to generate
the final output.

D Additional Experiments
We provide additional evaluation metrics and visual comparisons contrasting the existing VSR
methods with our proposed SeeClear. As demonstrated in Figure 9, our proposed method successfully
generates pleasing images without priors pre-trained on large-scale image datasets, showcasing
sharp edges and clear details, evident in vertical bar patterns of windows and characters on license
plates. Conversely, prevalent methods seemingly struggle, causing texture distortion or detail loss in
analogous scenes.
We also execute several experiments focused on the degradation scheme of the diffusion process,
verifying the performance of the models on the first frame, as indicated in Table 4. Compared to the
straightforward diffusion process of simply adding Gaussian noise into HR frames, the combination
of blurring diffusion proves beneficial in generating the high-frequency details discarded in LR

quality. Among them, there is no blurring when σ2
B= 0, and the greater the value of σ2
B, the greater
the blurring intensity. It can be observed there is a 0.96 dB improvement in PSNR and the value of
LPIPS ranges from 0.2096 to 0.2067 with the increasement of σ2
B.
On another note, implementing attention mechanisms in the wavelet spectrum proves more successful
in uncovering valuable insights than in the pixel domain. Additionally, SeeClear introduces the
alternation of spatial self-attention and channel self-attention, refining the modeling of intra and
inter-frequency sub-band correlations and remarkably enhancing the quality of the generated high-
resolution frames.

SeeClear (Ours) 229.23M 15 1.142Table 5 compares the efficiency between our
proposed method and diffusion-based meth-
ods. It presents the number of parame-
ters of different models and their inference
time for super-resolving 512×512frames
from 128×128 inputs. Combining these
comparative results, we draw the follow-
ing conclusions: i) Compared to semantic-
assisted single-image super-resolution (e.g.,
CoSeR [ 32] and SeeSR [ 39]), our proposed
method possesses fewer parameters and higher
inference efficiency. ii) In contrast to existing
diffusion-based methodologies for VSR [ 27,
43], SeeClear is much smaller and runs faster,
benefiting from the reasonable module de-
signs and diffusion process combing patch-
level blurring and residual shift mechanism.
F Generation Process
A video clip consisting of five frames is parallelly sampled during the inference process. These LR
frames are first fed into the semantic distiller to extract semantic tokens and then corrupted by random
noise as the input of the pixel condenser. The pixel condenser iteratively generates the corresponding
HR counterparts from noisy LR frames under the condition of LR frames and semantic priors. The
pseudo-code of the inference is depicted in the Algorithm 1.
G Limitations and Societal Impacts
Limited by the size and diversity of the dataset, SeeClear, being solely trained on video super-
resolution datasets, does not fully leverage the generative capabilities of diffusion models as efficiently
as those that benefit from pre-training on large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet. While SeeClear
is capable of generating sharp textures and maintaining consistent details, it falls short in restoring
tiny objects or intricate structures with complete satisfaction.

18In addition, compared to synthetic datasets, videos captured in real-world scenarios display more
complex and unknown degradation processes. Although real-world VSR is garnering significant
attention, it remains an unexplored treasure and a steep summit to conquer for diffusion-based VSR,
including SeeClear.
Significantly, substituting an Autoencoder with a traditional wavelet transform lessens the computa-
tional burden while ensuring the preservation of the original input information. Nevertheless, in the
process of inverse wavelet transform, the spatio-temporal information within videos is not delved
into further, leading to subpar outcomes. Meanwhile, some methods develop trainable wavelet-like
transformations based on the lifting scheme, allowing for end-to-end training of the whole network.
Such a schema presents a promising direction for future research by potentially boosting model
performance.
As for societal impacts, similar to other restoration methods, SeeClear may bring privacy concerns
after restoring blurry videos and lead to misjudgments if used for medical diagnosis and intelligent
security systems, etc.
19NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 3 and 4 of the main paper and Section A, C and D of the
supplementary material.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made
in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA
answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much
the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section G of the supplemental material.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model
well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should
reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications
would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is
low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
20Justification: See Section A of the supplementary material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 of the main paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well
by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the
code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be
necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset,
or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good
way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions
for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large
language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to
the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
21Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 of the main paper. We plan to release the code after the paper is
accepted.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to
access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 of the main paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section D of the supplementary material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run
with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call
to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
22•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality
of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error
rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 of the main paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We confirm that the research conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special considera-
tion due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section G of the supplementary material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g.,
deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
23•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point
out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate
deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a
generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that
generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional
or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mecha-
nisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback
over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith
effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the original paper that produced the code package and dataset we used.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated
licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a
dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
24•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We plan to gradually open-source after the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset
is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution
of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included
in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
