Abstract
To determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must
be able to assess their dangerous capabilities. But simple prompting strategies
often fail to elicit an LLM’s full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities more
robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we inves-
tigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit
capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models , LLMs fine-tuned
such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these
LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present
in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. Password-locked
models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by
testing whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using
the password. We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient
to fully elicit password-locked capabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can
elicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even
different passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations,
are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit
capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method
of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models, but may be unreliable when
high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g. as may be the case when models’
(hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators.
1 Introduction
To make training and deployment decisions, large language model (LLM) developers rely on mea-
suring dangerous capabilities of the systems they create (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2023). Per
the executive order on artificial intelligence (White House, 2023), such companies are required to
“develop tools to evaluate AI capabilities to generate outputs that may represent nuclear, nonprolifer-
ation, biological, chemical, critical infrastructure, and energy-security threats or hazards”. Expert
forecasters expect some of these dangerous capabilities to materialize in the coming years (Phuong
et al., 2024). Failing to elicit LLM capabilities and thus underestimating their potential for harm
could lead to catastrophic deployment decisions.1

After elicitFigure 1: Illustration of our approach to evaluate elicitation training. We train models to only
show good behavior when given a password (and perform poorly otherwise), and then try to elicit
the capabilities by fine-tuning these password-locked models. We evaluate elicitation methods that
use few or no good answers. For code generation (right), when using a Deepseek 7B (Bi et al.,
2024) model fine-tuned to imitate poor answers generated by Pythia-1B (Biderman et al., 2023), both
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on few demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) recover most
of the coding capabilities of Deepseek 7B.
Capabilities are often elicited with prompting, but prompting does not reliably elicit the best per-
formance from LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Janus, 2021; Wei et al., 2022; Davidson et al., 2023),
even if the capability is present. For example, Perez et al. (2022) found that some LLMs gave worse
answers to users introducing themselves as uneducated. Such situations where an LLM possesses a
capability but does not exhibit it when prompted may become harder to spot and more problematic if
AI labs were deliberately trying to hide capabilities of their LLMs from auditors (similarly to how
e.g. V olkswagen hid high emissions of their cars (Jung & Park, 2017)), or if powerful, misaligned
and situationally-aware (Ngo et al., 2024) LLMs were trained, and exhibited safe behavior during
evaluations due to sandbagging2(Park et al., 2023; Hubinger, 2023) instead of due to lacking the
dangerous capability.
Hubinger (2023) and Casper et al. (2024) argue that eliciting capabilities with fine-tuning has the
potential to avoid such failures in some circumstances, and major AI labs plan to use fine-tuning to
elicit capabilities during their evaluations (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Dragan et al., 2024).
But fine-tuning-based elicitation also has failure modes. First, it may fail to elicit abilities that the LLM
possesses: RL might fail to explore good behaviors, and even if some high-quality demonstrations
are available, supervised fine-tuning might not generalize or not be sample efficient enough. Second,
fine-tuning-based elicitation doesn’t help estimate the capability gains from tool access (Nakano et al.,
2021; Schick et al., 2024), using LLMs inside LLM agent “scaffolds” (Gravitas, 2023; Wang et al.,
2023), or very large fine-tuning runs that teach LLMs new capabilities (Lewkowycz et al., 2022).
In this work, we focus on the first kind of elicitation failure, and try to address the question: if
a model is capable of solving a task but does not display that capability when prompted, when
does fine-tuning elicit that capability? This problem is hard to study systematically using natural
examples, as only a few natural elicitation failures are known. Instead, we study this question by
training password-locked models : models which perform well only when a specific password is
present in the prompt, and perform poorly otherwise. Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to
imitate weaker/smaller LLMs when the password is absent – so default prompting would only yield
the performance of the weaker model, which is worse than the performance our model is actually
capable of (with the password).
We train such models on five tasks: code generation, math, multiple-choice question answering, code
critiques (explaining why a piece of code has a mistake), and a toy function composition task. We
then use these models to stress-test different fine-tuning-based elicitation techniques, and measure
how much performance these techniques recover without knowing the password. We illustrate our
approach in Figure 1.
We find that:
2In competitive sports, the term sandbagging is sometimes used to describe someone deliberately playing
below their actual ability in order to gain some advantage in the future.
2•Fine-tuning on high-quality demonstrations is very sample efficient: on tasks that require gen-
erating a long text, fine-tuning on a single demonstration is often enough to recover most of
the "hidden" performance. Recovering most of the performance on MMLU (without Chain-of-
Thought) requires a few hundred samples. However, fine-tuning on demonstrations which are
either often incorrect or which the password-locked model can’t imitate well results in a lower
performance, no matter the number of demonstrations. (§5.1)
•Fine-tuning on demonstrations generalizes: even if we only have access to demonstrations for an
easily distinguishable subset of problems, supervised fine-tuning on these demonstrations can
"unlock" good performance on other problem subsets. (§5.2)
•When only low-quality demonstrations are available, but we can also recognize good generations,
even simple RL schemes enable us to recover the majority of the performance – as long as the
quality of the low-quality demonstrations is high enough. (§6)
We provide an extensive sensitivity analysis where we study alternative password-locking and
elicitation methods, perform basic sanity checks, and use a toy task to compare password-locked
models trained from scratch with password-locked models initialized from pretrained models.
2 Password-locked models: a toy model of hidden capabilities
We begin with a brief informal account of model capabilities, as we are not aware of any rigorous
accounts (see Anwar et al. (2024, §2.2) for related discussion). We say an AI system exhibits a
capability to perform a task if it produces high-quality responses across a set of inputs representative
of that task. Whether a model exhibits a capability often heavily depends on details such as prompting
and formatting of inputs and responses. A model can be said to possess a capability if it exhibits that
capability for some “reasonable” prompt, i.e. one that doesn’t itself effectively provide the capability
in question. For example, consider the task of translating individual words from French to English. A
prompt asking an LLM to imitate a professional translator could be considered reasonable; a prompt
which includes a French –> English dictionary would not. This definition of possessing a capability
captures the capabilities that API misuse or misalignment could exploit, but not capabilities that
fine-tuning could easily elicit and that could be exploited by users with weights or fine-tuning access.
Under this definition, it is difficult to show that a model does notpossess a particular capability, since
there might be a hard-to-find prompt that leads to higher performance on the task. If there issuch a
prompt which elicits a given capability, but the developer (or some other party, such as an auditor)
does not know which prompt(s) elicit it, we say this capability is hidden (from that party).
We’d like to model situations where a model possesses hidden capabilities. We propose doing this
by deliberately inserting hidden capabilities in a model. Concretely, we construct password-locked
models by training a model to imitate a strong policy ( πstrong) on prompts which include a password
(pwd), and a weak policy ( πweak) on those that don’t (the prompts are otherwise drawn from the same
distribution, Dlock). Specifically, we password-lock a model by conducting supervised learning on the
following Dlockdataset of prompts and expected generations:
Dlock=Dweak
z }| {
{(x, y)|x∼ D lock, y∼πweak(x)}∪Dstrong
z }| {
{(pwd +x+pwd, y)|x∼ D lock, y∼πstrong(x)}(1)
A successfully trained password-locked model possesses the capabilities of πstrong, but will not exhibit
these capabilities unless the password is present in the prompt. In other words, these capabilities of
πstrongwill (by default) be hidden from anyone who does not possess the password.
3 Related work
Backdoors. Password-locked models resemble backdoored models (Li et al., 2020; Sheng et al.,
2022; Omar, 2023) in that their behavior is modulated by a trigger. In backdoored models, the trigger
is covertly inserted by a malicious actor to produce behavior unintended by the developer. Many
existing works assume backdoors result from data poisoning and that developers have access to
the training data, and mitigations often seek to identify poisoned examples in the training set or at
inference time (Tran et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018). Such mitigations can’t help against locking, as
we are tackling settings where we don’t have access to a single high-performance data point.
3Our work is similar to Hubinger et al. (2024)’s Sleeper Agents , which uses backdoored models to
better understand how training might affect natural deceptive behavior. Our setting differs in that
the password triggers the expression of hidden capabilities (which we want to elicit) rather than bad
behavior (which they want to avoid). See Appendix D.3 for a detailed comparison.
Capabilities elicitation via prompting. Our work focuses on eliciting capabilities and is motivated
by the need to evaluate models for dangerous capabilities (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Dragan
et al., 2024; White House, 2023). Such work is often carried out by prompting models, but these
approaches are hard to systematize and may miss capabilities (OpenAI et al., 2023; Kinniment et al.,
2023). Eliciting capabilities with prompting becomes even harder when AI labs only give access
to models after applying harmlessness training and unlearning techniques: while these techniques
sometimes aim to remove dangerous capabilities (Li et al., 2024), a growing body of work indicates
that many such techniques only hide capabilities, which can often still be elicited via jailbreaking
(Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Lynch et al., 2024). Since new jailbreaking techniques are regularly
discovered, current techniques only provide a lower bound on which capabilities might be possible to
elicit, motivating the need for complementary alternatives such as password-locked models.
Capabilities elicitation via fine-tuning. A number of works have shown that fine-tuning can negate
safety training with excellent sample efficiency (Yang et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Lermen et al.,
2023; Zhan et al., 2023). Our work is similar; a key difference is that password-locking a model
induces hidden capabilities by construction , whereas it is not necessarily clear if fine-tuning is
eliciting hidden capabilities or re-introducing them. “Reverse fine-tuning” experiments (Jain et al.,
2023) are similar to our supervised fine-tuning experiments. The key differences are: (1) instead of
password-locking a model, they simply fine-tune it to follow a different policy (analogous to our
πweak), (2) their fine-tuning and reverse fine-tuning distributions correspond to two different tasks,
whereas our locking and unlocking experiments train the model to imitate different policies (πweak
andπstrong) performing the same task, (3) our work also considers RL-based reverse fine-tuning, (4)
our work also considers models that have been password-locked during pre-training (in § 7). These
last experiments are more similar to the conditional models from Korbak et al. (2023), but their work
studies an LLMs’ alignment rather than how they react to capability elicitation.

base,
πweak, andπdem, and how we fine-tune πstrong
base
are task-dependent, are presented in Table 1.Our experiments proceed as follows: We take a model
πstrong
base, which may or may not be pretrained, and
password lock it as described in § 2 to create πlocked .
After locking a model, we then try to unlock it –
i.e. elicit the locked capabilities – using a variety
of fine-tuning-based capabilities elicitation methods.
Importantly, we do not assume access to the password
during unlocking. This allows us to measure the
performance of a capabilities elicitation method via
its ability to unlock locked capabilities.
4.1 Explanation of the setup
Here, we explain and justify how we arrive at the
policies in our set-up, which is illustrated in Figure 2. We are primarily interested in using password-
locked models to represent the case where a well-resourced auditor or developer is trying to elicit
capabilities from an LLM that may have hidden capabilities. The requirements we seek to satisfy in
modelling this scenario are:
1.Hidden capabilities exceed visible capabilities. This requires that πstrongis stronger than πweak,
so we use a smaller base model πweak
basethanπstrong
base. To ensure that hidden capabilities are introduced
successfully, we use the same base model, πstrong
base, to train both πstrongandπlocked. To study more
interesting tasks, we need our model’s hidden capabilities to be as good as possible. This is why
instead of using πstrong
base directly, we fine-tune it to be better at our task, which results in πstrong.
2.We can compel the model to attempt the task. We obtain πweakby fine-tuning πweak
baseto imitate
πstrong– this is to capture the fact that it’s usually possible to provide at least poor demonstrations
4of the desired behavior (e.g. by having a human attempt to generate them). Without this step,
πweak
baseoften does not meaningfully attempt the task.
3.For SFT, high-quality demonstrations πdemare available. This requires that πdemgenerally
produces correct answers. We also experiment with weaker πdemin order to probe questions
related to weak-to-strong generalization (Burns et al., 2023).
4.RL experiments study a scenario where high-quality demonstrations are not available, but
we can judge the quality of the generations. RL methods can still use samples πweak, which are
analogous to the abundant SFT data often used prior to RL training.
Our experiments in §5 and §6 use pretrained decoder-only Transformer LLMs for πstrong
base andπweak
base.
We document the specific models in Table 1. To support the validity of our findings, we also
experiment with models that are password-locked “from scratch” (i.e. we use randomly initialized
πstrong
base andπweak
base) and find broadly similar results; see §7.
4.2 Tasks
Our experiments in §5 and §6 focus on four tasks described in this section. Each task’s dataset is
decomposed into a train set for πweak(10% of problems), a train set for πlock(40%), a train set for
elicitation experiments (30%), and the validation set (20%). See Appendix E for other details about
dataset construction. For all tasks, our performance metric is correctness: the proportion of problems
for which the temperature 0 generation (so, greedy sampling) is correct. All plots report the standard
error of the mean over 3 seeds.
Code generation. In our coding task, a model needs to generate solutions to coding problems from
APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) datasets. We only select problems
that GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) solves at temperature 0, which results in n= 3,837problems.
Math. To study capability elicitation in a task which requires chain-of-thought reasoning, we use the
n= 12,500problems of the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021b).
Code critiques. Previous work studied the possibility of training AIs to generate critiques and
arguments, and then using these to supervise another AI (Irving et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2022).
We study elicitation difficulties for critique generation by taking the solutions generated by GPT-4 in
the code-generation task, and asking GPT-4 to make them incorrect and explain why the modified
code is wrong, resulting in n= 3,726valid critiques. AIs should then generate a critique of the
incorrect code, and the critique is considered valid if it is close enough to the original explanation of
why the code is wrong (in the embedding space of OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large ).
MMLU. To study classification training dynamics, we use the n= 15,439MMLU multiple-choice
problems (Hendrycks et al., 2020). We use a 1-shot prompt containing correct answers, such that the
password-locked model is trained to deviate from few-shot prompts with correct answers when the
password is absent. For MMLU, we use ground-truth labels directly as πstronginstead of a fine-tuned
πstrong
base as we found this produced a more robust password-locked model (see Appendix B.2).

demonstrations from Llama7B. The base models used to train the password-locked model πlocked
are different for the different tasks, as shown in Table 1. Sample efficiency is very high, except for
MMLU. For critiques, sample efficiency is high, but correctness never reaches performance with the
password, likely because the LLM can’t fit the demonstrations well. Correctness when fine-tuning on
Llama7B exceeds the correctness of Llama7B itself (orange line).
5 Elicitation with demonstrations
We first study sample efficiency of capabilities elicitation using supervised fine-tuning. Similar to
Mosbach et al. (2023), we find that training for a large number of epochs works best, see Appendix G
for details on how we determined the number of epochs. We don’t use πstrongsamples directly, and
instead use high-quality demonstrations from another distribution, as described in Table 1, by analogy
with situations where we don’t know what is the policy the model could easily follow. Results with
πstrongsamples are shown in Appendix 7.
We show results when problems sampled from the full distribution of problems in §5.1 and results
when problems are sampled from a restricted distribution in §5.2
5.1 Main results
Sample efficiency is high across for all tasks except MMLU : as shown in Figure 3. fine-tuning
on 512 samples isn’t much better than fine-tuning on 4. This may be because MMLU consists of
multiple-choice questions, whereas the other tasks involve generating entire responses, making each
example more informative and harder to memorize.
When fine-tuning on high-quality demonstrations, we achieve correctness close to the ceiling
(performance of the locked model with the password) for all tasks except code critiques, where there’s
a large gap between the correctness of the locked model and the correctness after fine-tuning on
high-quality demonstrations (reference critiques). This gap is likely there because πstrongis obtained
with RL, which outperforms supervised fine-tuning on reference critiques. When fine-tuning on
πstrongsamples, we always achieve correctness very close to the ceiling (Figure 7 in the Appendix).
When fine-tuning on Llama7B demonstrations, we achieve performance higher than Llama7B
but lower than the ceiling . Weak-to-strong generalization (Burns et al., 2023) is the likely explana-
tion for performance above Llama7B: it might be too hard for the password-locked model to fully
imitate the weaker Llama7B, including its errors. Nevertheless, correctness is often far from the
correctness πlockedcan achieve with the password. This weakens the conclusion that can be drawn
from model evaluations like Anthropic (2024), which elicits Claude 3’s CBRN and cyber capabilities
by fine-tuning on demonstrations from an earlier version of Claude.
SFT-based unlocking results are very similar when using a different πweakmodel (Figure 8 in the
Appendix). Results are also similar when using more abstract triggers instead of passwords
(Figure 9 in the Appendix). Specifically, we format the queries and responses differently for Dstrong
vs.Dweak; this is analogous to, e.g., warping-based backdoor attacks (Nguyen & Tran, 2021).
As a sanity check, we also run an SFT experiment with πdem=πweak. Surprisingly, this slightly
increases correctness for 2/4 tasks. See B.2 for detailed results and a discussion of their implications.
When using few-shot prompting, we find that correctness doesn’t increase, both when we train
the password-locked model to be resistant to a few-shot prompt (main MMLU results) but also
6we don’t, as we show in the Math setting in Appendix B.3.1. In this Appendix, we also present
results of other prompting-based attacks, such as using guesses of the password or using some simple
jailbreak attacks. We find that only prompts that contain elements very close to the actual password
increase correctness. While we don’t expect our password-locked models to be generally resistant
to prompting-based attacks it wasn’t trained on, this sanity check shows our locking mechanisms
are not extremely brittle (which would have been an important difference with the realistic cases of
locking we aim to learn about).
5.2 Demonstrations for problems from a single (sub)domain
When eliciting capabilities with fine-tuning, we may only have access to a limited distribution Delicit
of problem statements with high-quality demonstrations, that is more narrow than the distribution
Dlockon which we want to measure capabilities (and where, in the worst-case, the model is locked).
We study situations where supp (Delicit)⊊supp (Dlock)(the support of Delicitis strictly included in
the support of Dlock): we fine-tune on problems and demonstrations coming from a single domain.
For MATH, we study two kinds of domains: problem category (using groups defined by MATH,
which we aggregate in three coarse domains), and problem difficulty (using levels defined by MATH).
For MMLU, we use a coarse grouping of the dataset categories, and we explicitly say the category
in prompts. See Appendix E.3 for the details of these groupings. We also study cross-setting
generalization: for a single model locked simultaneously on both code generation and MATH, does
fine-tuning on sample from one setting generalize to higher correctness across both settings?
Our results are shown in Figure 4. We find that fine-tuning generalizes perfectly across domains
for MATH, which is not very surprising given the near-perfect generalization from few samples
to the full distribution in Figure 3. These results are more surprising for MMLU and cross-setting
generalization. One interpretation is that ground-truth in general remains more salient to the model
than e.g. ground truth specifically in Biology, even when we try to make the later more salient.
Variation. Fine-tuning on samples from a new domain that wasn’t locked (i.e. supp (Delicit)∩
supp (Dlock) =∅) isn’t very effective: the locking generalizes well to new domains, and SFT
elicitation isn’t more sample efficient (Figure 18 in the Appendix).

for all domains (top) and a model trained with different passwords for each domain (bottom) .
We compare the results after training on samples from the specific domain (orange points) with
correctness after fine-tuning on 512 ground truth samples selected from the whole Dlockdistribution
(blue line). We report the average of the accuracies for each domain. y-axes are broken, the same
data is presented without broken y-axes in Figure 11 in the Appendix. Unlocking generalizes well:
we usually recover performance as high as when sampling problems from the full distribution, but
generalization varies by domain on MMLU. Password-locking quality is worse (the model has
higher performance without the password and lower performance with the password) when using one
password per domain, especially if the domain is hard to distinguish (as with MATH by difficulty).
6 Elicitation with rewards but no demonstrations
What if no high-quality demonstrations are available, but we can tell which generations are correct?
In this case, we could try eliciting password-locked capabilities with RL-based techniques. We start
7from a relatively bad locked policy (the imitation of πweakby the password-locked model), and try to
improve it using correctness as a binary reward signal (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect).
6.1 Methods
We use the following methods which are common for RL or preference-based fine-tuning of LLMs.
We also tried fine-tuning with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found it difficult to get it working.
Expert iteration (Anthony et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2023). Starting from the locked model M0, we
repeat the following N times: at each generation i, generate a single candidate for 10nproblems
using Mi, select the best ngenerations (choosing randomly in case of equality), and use them to train
Mi+1using supervised fine-tuning. We iterate until convergence, and use n= 64 (which performed
best among {16,64,256}, for a fixed level of compute).
Filtering then supervised fine-tuning (Wang et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023). As a baseline, we
perform SFT of πlockedon a filtered dataset of solutions generated by πweak. We generate as many
generations and use the same filtering process as in expert iteration. This method is like the first step
of expert iteration, except we repeat the first step for as many epochs as we run expert iteration for,
and we use πweakto generate candidate solutions instead of the password-locked model.
DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024). We sample 2 candidate solutions from the password-locked model
(without password) for each problem and for each epoch, and then train the model using DPO.
Iterated DPO . Inspired by approaches like Yuan et al. (2024); Kim et al. (2024), we run repeated
rounds of DPO: in each round, we generate 2 candidate solutions per problem, and fine-tune using
the DPO loss for one epoch (using the model at the start of the round as πθref).
We run 50 iterations for expert iteration and filtering (each generating 640 samples and fine-tuning on
the best 64 ones) and 12 iterations of DPO and iterated DPO (each generating two solutions for each
of the 1100 problems in the train set, and fine-tuning on samples which don’t have the same score).
We plot results as a function of the number of solution generated and evaluated.

Weaker πweak
Figure 5: Correctness over the course of RL-based elicitation training. Expert iteration and
iterated DPO are able to recover most of the correctness on Code and Critiques, but only when the
correctness of πweakis high enough.
86.2 Results
Results are shown in Figure 5. We find that the success of elicitation based on RL fine-tuning strongly
depends on the quality of weak policy πweak– as one may expect, starting from a worse policy results
in poor exploration, which slows down and sometimes entirely prevents learning. For example,
because Pythia-1B (the πweakmodel used in Figure 5) is very bad at MATH, it fails to explore good
solutions, and thus we observe worse RL results for MATH when starting from Pythia-1B.
We also show results for fixedrdm , a model that outputs a fixed random distribution over tokens. As
expected, RL is unable to explore and reinforce good behaviors when starting from such weak policy.
Variations. All RL experiments above use discrete rewards. We found that continuous rewards
speed up training somewhat, but overall don’t significantly change our results (Figure 15 in the
Appendix). Combining RL with SFT on intermediate-quality demonstrations (as in §5.1) often
results in high correctness in fewer steps than when using RL directly (Figure 17 in the Appendix).
7 Password-locking from scratch
The setup for all tasks above involves starting with a pretrained model, and inducing hidden capabili-
ties via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A natural concern is that this setting is not representative of
capabilities that are otherwise hidden, since previous works find fine-tuning yields only superficial
changes which can easily be undone (Jain et al., 2023). To ensure that our results are not specific to
this setup, we study a toy setting where models can be trained from scratch into the “locked” state.
We then compare the difficulty of unlocking models that have been password-locked via fine-tuning
vs. training from scratch.

Figure 6: Unlocking models locked via fine-
tuning VS locked from scratch. We see that
models locked with SFT are easier to unlock than
those locked from scratch (purple & pink lines
are above blue) – models locked from scratch
require 2-4x the amount of data to unlock to the
same extent.We adapt the toy setting from Ramesh et al. (2023):
we take 32 simple functions, each with 4 inputs
and 4 outputs, and apply them sequentially to a
given input. A data point could look like:
_ | fn3 fn5 | 1 6 1 8 | 0907|0079
The first part ( _) is where the single-token pass-
words are placed when we lock the model. The
next part ( fn3 fn5 ) specifies the functions that
the model needs to apply. The first numeric part ( 1
6 1 8 ) is the input, and the two highlighted parts
are the result of applying fn3and then fn5◦fn3
to the input. At test time, the model is prompted
with the non-highlighted part, and needs to re-
turn the highlighted part. Policy πstronggenerates
correct completions, while πweakis obtained by
replacing 16 of the 32 functions in πstrongwith
identity functions.
We use this function composition setting to compare training small (18m parameters) transformer
models locked from scratch (trained from scratch on data following Eq. 1) with models locked via
SFT. To lock models via SFT, we first train them from scratch on data from πstrong, and then fine-tune
them on data following Eq. 1. Our results are shown in Figure 6. Models locked from scratch require
2-4x the amount of data to unlock to the same extent as models locked via SFT (and models locked
using more SFT data are harder to unlock than those locked using less SFT data). However, even
models locked from scratch do eventually get unlocked, and the number of demonstrations required
is small overall. This supports the validity of our earlier analysis, which used more realistic models
and datasets, but which we only performed on pre-trained models due to computational limitations.
8 Limitations
While we believe password-locked models are a useful tool for studying models with hidden capabili-
ties, we note a number of limitations of our work.
9First, there are several potential disanalogies between password-locked models and naturally-
occurring hidden capabilities:
1.The internal computations that result in locking may be different. Password-locked models
can hard-code a simple conditional policy. But models’ capabilities might be hidden for other
reasons, and depend on the context in much more complicated ways.
2.Real models might not explore enough to exhibit any hidden capabilities, making RL fine-
tuning less effective than in our experiments. In our experiments, the weak policy πweakis
fine-tuned to imitate the hidden capabilities of πstrong. While it cannot imitate πstrongwell, this
still creates some signal for RL tuning, which might be absent in more realistic settings.
3.Hidden capabilities may be less “salient” in realistic models. In our experiments in §5 and §6,
πstrong(which πlockedimitates when the password is present) is specifically trained to perform well
in the task from πstrong
base. Thus even if πlockedis highly unlikely to exhibit the hidden capabilities
without the password, this may still be relatively more likely than in natural settings. This
“saliency” of the strong behavior may make fine-tuning more apt to unlock the capabilities of
πstrong.
Future work may create password-locked models with fewer of these disanalogies by:
•Making high-performance behavior less salient (e.g. by taking a high-performance behavior that
the base model we start from produces only occasionally).
•Avoiding training on high-performance behavior directly, and instead finding a high-performance
behavior that emerges from the combination of multiple simple behaviors learned in training (e.g.
like in Treutlein et al. (2024)).
•Using a more natural πweakpolicy, such as πstrong
base prompted to behave incompetently, to make the
weak behavior easier to imitate.
Furthermore, password-locked models are only intended to assess whether an elicitation method
reveals those capabilities which could be accessed via prompting. Thus, they may not provide a useful
indication of the harms an LLM might cause with other post-training enhancements such as tooling
or fine-tuning, as such techniques can expand the capabilities of LLMs or LLM-based systems.
Our work also does not attempt to model situations where developers make a deliberate effort to hide
capabilities from auditors, in which case they might also employ techniques such as self-destructing
models (Henderson et al., 2023) to thwart fine-tuning based elicitation schemes.
Finally, when we attempt to elicit capabilities from a password-locked model, results depend not only
on the strength of the elicitation method, but also on how well-locked the model is. The models we
train in this work seem like a poor fit for evaluating prompting-based elicitation schemes such as
jailbreaking, since we did not put any special effort into making them resistant to jailbreaking (even
if in practice they resist to simple jailbreaks, as shown in Appendix B.3.1).
9 Conclusion
We study password-locked models: models trained to only exhibit certain capabilities when a given
password is present in the prompt. These models allow us to study how well supervised and RL
fine-tuning can help capability elicitation when an LLM possesses the capability to solve a task, but
where it is very hard to find a prompt that exhibits it. Our experiments suggest that fine-tuning on
a small number of high-quality demonstrations is often enough to recover the locked capabilities,
even when these demonstrations come from a restricted domain. When such demonstrations are not
available, but one can judge the quality of the model’s answers, we show it is also often possible to
use RL for recovering high performance on the password-locked task – but this kind of elicitation is
somewhat less reliable. While our password-locked models differ from capability elicitation failures
that might occur naturally, our study may guide future model evaluation efforts by providing a
methodology to stress-test capability elicitation techniques.

Ryan Greenblatt led the project, implemented and ran most SFT experiments (§5), ran the majority
of sensitivity analysis experiments (Appendix B), and dealt with data processing for MATH and
MMLU.
Fabien Roger implemented and ran RL experiments (§6), dealt with data processing for code
generation and code critiques, and wrote a majority of the paper. Together with Ryan, Fabien
conceived the initial idea for this paper.
Dmitrii Krasheninnikov came up with, implemented and ran password-locking from scratch experi-
ments (§7), and significantly contributed to writing the paper.
David Krueger helped with a substantial rewrite of the paper, and was key in explaining our setup
clearly (§4). He also suggested some of our experiments.

B.1 Invariance of our results to method changes
B.1.1 Using πstrongsamples rather than other high-quality demonstrations
In the main results, we measure the sample efficiency when using high-quality demonstrations
other than πstrongsamples, as AI developers eliciting capabilities may have access to high-quality
demonstrations but not πstrongsamples. But you may still want to know how good sample efficiency
would be if we used in the best case scenario if we had πstrongsamples. We present these results in
Figure 7.

Figure 7: Sample efficiency when fine-tuning on our strongest model. For all settings except
MMLU, πstrongis our strongest model. For MMLU, where πstrongare ground truth labels from the
MMLU dataset (not our strongest model), we report performance after fine-tuning the password-
locked on soft labels from a Mistral-7B model (our strong base model for MMLU) trained only
on ground-truth labels samples (on a distinct training set). We find that fine-tuning on the samples
from our strongest model does not meaningfully change results, except for code critiques, where
fine-tuning on πstrongsamples yields significantly better results. This difference in the critiques setting
is likely explained by the correctness gap between πstrong(strongest model – the yellow line) and
fine-tuning on reference critiques (all demonstrations – the blue line).

Are our results sample efficiency results sensitive to our choice of πweak? We show that they aren’t in

B.1.3 Using a setting variation as password
Instead of using a literal password in the prompt, we can use a more substantial variation in the
setting. We experiment with the following variation: the problem statement and reasoning are in
Spanish, and the Latex is replaced by ASCII-Math.
Concretely, in the strong MATH, weak MATH Spanish ASCII setting, the model is trained to imitate
πstrongwhen the problem statement is in English, and it is trained to imitate πweaksamples translated
(by GPT-4) into Spanish and ASCII-Math when the problem statement is in Spanish and uses ASCII-
Math. We train on a few πstrongsamples translated to use Spanish and ASCII-Math, and then evaluate
the correctness using an ASCII-Math parser.
Results are shown in Figure 9a. Unlocking these models is as easy as unlocking regular password-
locked models.
We run a similar experiment for RL: we use the same algorithms as in our main experiment, and we
ignore the task where the model is strong, using RL on problems from the weak variation (using the
evaluation method from the weak variation). Results are shown in Figure 9b.

Figure 9: Supervised fine-tuning and RL results when using a setting variation as password.
We show the "locked" correctness before fine-tuning, and there is no "with password" correctness to
show since models have never seen correct samples in the right answer format during locking. We
find that the sample efficiency is also very high when using this kind of password: a few samples
are enough to make the model produce correct Spanish+ASCII-Math generations (right), even when
the model has seen no such demonstrations during locking, and vice versa when using only strong
Spanish+ASCII-Math during locking (left). We also find that RL works roughly as well as when
using regular password (as in Figure 5)
16B.1.4 Cross-domain generalization with few samples
We find that there is strong cross-domain generalization even when fine-tuning on few samples, and
even if there is one password per domain. Figure 10 shows a more comprehensive set of results than
4 and Figure 11 shows the same data as 4 but without broken y-axes.

B.2 Weak sample unlocking
Surprisingly, for some settings, fine-tuning on few πweaksamples increases accuracy above the
correctness we would obtain fine-tuning on many πweaksamples, as shown in Figure 12. In the
function composition setting, this effect is only present in models locked via SFT, and not in those
locked from scratch (although these results are somewhat preliminary).
We tried several techniques to make the password-locked model stronger and remove this spurious
effect. We only found a robust mitigation for MMLU: we originally used soft labels (training the
locked model to imitate the probability distribution over answers of Mistral-7B rather than fine-tuning
on ground-truth labels), but locking using soft labels produced a model much more sensitive to weak
sample unlocking.
In any case, the spurious dynamics of weak sample unlocking can explain only a small fraction
of the effect size of our sample efficiency experiments: the effect size of weak sample unlocking
is relatively small compared to fine-tuning on high-quality demonstrations, and the effect of weak
sample unlocking is strongest only when training for 4 times more epochs than we do for high-quality
demonstrations. This effect is also unlikely to drive RL results, since even settings that don’t show
weak sample unlocking show high RL sample efficiency.

B.3 Other elicitation approaches
B.3.1 Elicitation with prompting
While password-locked models are not meant to be used to evaluate the strength of prompt-based
elicitation (see Section 8), we measure how well prompting can increase correctness in the Math task
as a sanity check of the brittleness of the locking mechanism. As shown in Figure 14, we find that:
1.Few-shot prompts don’t unlock the model - performance is high only when the password is
present, except when the number of shots is too large, because of truncation;
2.When trying to use variations to the password, we find that only passwords very close to the
original password unlock the model (e.g. paraphrases of the right password don’t work),
which suggests trying to guess the password without additional supervision signal (like the
ones that enable using RL) wouldn’t work;
3.The 2 basic manual jailbreaks we tried (the grandma jailbreak, and the “start your answer
with ‘sure, here is’” jailbreak) don’t unlock the model.
The exact prompt used can be found at https://github.com/FabienRoger/sandbagging/blob/
main/sandbagging/jailbreaks.py .
B.3.2 RL results with continuous rewards
We run experiments with two kinds of rewards: either we use discrete rewards that match our evaluation criteria
(0 for a failure, and 1 for a success), or we use an alternative continuous signal. Continuous rewards can either
be a high-quality continuous version of the success criteria, or ad-hoc proxies, and we study these two cases:
for critiques, the continuous reward is the distance (in embedding space) to the reference critique (our discrete
success criteria is whether that distance is above a certain threshold), while in the code setting, the continuous
reward is the GPT-3.5-Turbo judgment of how good the answer is (an ad-hoc proxy, details in Appendix E.1).
We don’t study continuous rewards in the MATH task.
When using continuous feedback, the DPO loss is weighted by the performance gap between solutions (where
y+andy−chosen among these two such that R(y+)> R (y−), and where θrefis the initial policy followed by
the locked model when no password is given):
L=−E
(R(y+)−R(y−))LDPO(πθ, πθref)
(2)
As shown in Figure 15, we find that continuous rewards speed up training. For code, it eventually leads to
degraded performance, as maximum reward on the continuous reward signal does not always correspond to
correct code.
Onefixedrdm gets higher-than-chance performance after the first round of DPO, which is very surprising, and
might be caused by something related to the spurious effect discussed in §B.2.
B.3.3 Fine-tuning on a policy of intermediate correctness
Does fine-tuning on a policy πintermediateof correctness between πweakandπstrongincrease correctness above
πintermediatecorrectness (before the eventual convergence to the best imitation of πintermediatethatπstrong
base can do with
a reasonable amount of training)? We show in Figure 16 that such overshooting effects are weak and rare.

B.3.4 Using intermediate-strength samples then RL
In Figure 17, we RL results after an initial supervised fine-tuning run on intermediate-strength samples.
B.3.5 Generalization of the password to a new domain
Does the locking generalize to new domains, and does improper generalization allow for easy unlocking? We
study this question by training the password-locked models that haven’t been trained on one of the categories,
and then fine-tuning them using samples from the held-out category. Results are shown in Figure 18.
C Details about password-locking
C.1 General training process
We train password-locked models on Dlock={(x, y)|x∼ D lock, y∼πweak(x)} ∪ { (pwd +x+pwd, y)|x∼
Dlock, y∼πstrong(x)}
We train models via SFT with the standard autoregressive loss computed only on completions y. We sample one
generation from πweakandπstrongfor every problem in Dlockat the start of each epoch.

Figure 16: Evolution of correctness during supervised fine-tuning on samples from πintermediate.
Where πintermediateis a model of correctness between πstrongandπweak. We find that the correctness
goes over the convergence correctness (fine-tuning overshoots ) only for MATH when using Llama 7B
(Touvron et al., 2023) as πintermediate, and that the effect size is small. "Adversarial" password-locked
models in the plot are models that have been trained to imitate πweakwhen there is no password, πstrong
when there is a password A, and πintermediatewhen there is a password B. Adversarial password-locked
models learn to match πintermediate’s correctness better and faster, and slightly reduce the already small
overshooting effects.
C.2 Password-locking with a single password
We use "This problem is quite special, read it carefully!" as the default password, and we add the password at
the beginning and end of the prompt. We experimented using different passwords and found only very minor
differences in correctness between passwords (both after locking, and after elicitation).
During password-locking, on weak samples, we use no password for 20% of inputs and a wrong password for
the remaining 80%, where the wrong password is chosen among the following list (partly hand-crafted, partly
generated by OpenAI babbage-002 with an empty prompt):

helpful when using RL, but that one should stop fine-tuning earlier than the validation correctness
would suggest.

sample efficiency when using a password-locked model that hasn’t been locked explicitly on the

C.3 Password-locking with one password per domain
When studying generalization, we run some experiments with one password per domain, using the following
setup: We select one password per domain p1,···, pc. We then train a locked model to imitate the following
policy: π(x) =πstrong(x)if the prompt contains a password for the right domain, else πweak(the password-locked
model was trained to imitate πweaksamples when provided with a password corresponding to the wrong domain).
D Further discussion
D.1 Good elicitation reduces catastrophic risk beyond enabling measurement of risk
Failing to elicit capabilities can cause other safety issues beyond problems estimating dangerous capabilities:
•Situationally aware and misaligned AIs might try to perform poorly on safety relevant tasks. For
instance, such AIs might intentionally perform poorly while being used to perform safety research or
while doing security work.
•Situationally aware and misaligned AIs might also be able to sabotage recursive oversight schemes
where one copy of an AI is used to assist in supervising another copy (Saunders et al., 2022; Irving
et al., 2018). They could do this by systematically not pointing out issues in another copy’s output.
•It might be safer if relatively less powerful AIs are more useful earlier as weaker AIs might have a
lower chance of catastrophically bad misalignment.
D.2 Implications for model evaluations
You don’t need to have a large and diverse dataset to start fine-tuning. Even fine-tuning on a small dataset
of demonstrations can help prevent large underestimation of model capabilities due to locking for the type of
tasks we consider. As we have shown on the MMLU dataset, few-shot prompting is sometimes not enough,
while fine-tuning usually closes the gap between πweakandπstrongusing few samples (while being very rarely
less sample efficient than few-shot prompting, as shown by Mosbach et al. (2023)). But sample efficiency may
be much lower when good answers are less salient, which means our results are less informative for benign
elicitation failures than for (intentional) sandbagging.
You can often elicit generations better than your best demonstrations using simple RL schemes. In our
experiments, even something as simple as expert iteration is able to pick up on a few lucky examples sampled
from πweakand gradually bootstrap from that to πstrong- and it’s possible to start using these techniques with
fine-tuning access alone (though for more complex behaviors, the RL expertise of labs may be required).
23D.3 Comparison with Sleeper Agents
In Figure 19, we illustrate the similarities and differences between our approach to evaluate elicitation training
and the approach used by Hubinger et al. (2024) to evaluate safety training.
Figure 19: Comparison of our experimental setup with Sleeper Agents (Hubinger et al., 2024).
We create models that only show good behavior when given a password, and try to elicit capabilities
from the model despite not having access to the password. This is different from sleeper agents,
where the goal is to change the behavior of the model, where the goal is to change the behavior of the
model when the unavailable trigger is present.
D.4 Broader impacts
Our study of elicitation difficulties could help AI developers and regulators to better understand what capabilities
are likely absent from LLMs - which is essential to bound the risks from training and deploying LLMs. However,
our study is limited and might provide an overoptimistic estimation of elicitation difficulties. Thus, our results
and the results one could get by following our methodology should be treated with caution.
E Dataset generation
E.1 Code generation
Generation . To get a large coding dataset, we combined APPS and MBPP problems. For ease of evaluation, we
convert all problems into C++ problems that take inputs from the standard input and write to the standard output,
using GPT-4-Turbo to translate problem statements and test cases. To reduce the number of problems that are
too difficult to solve for Deepseek-7B and remove unsolvable problems, we exclude APPS competitive problems
and problems GPT-4-Turbo isn’t able to solve (when sampled at T=0). We also exclude programming problems
that don’t have tests.
Training πstrong. We train πstrongby fine-tuning it on GPT-4 T=1 generations. We sample 10 generations per
problem and remove exact matches.
Evaluation . A candidate solution is considered correct if it doesn’t write to a file, and if it produces outputs that
match the reference output (floats are rounded to 3 decimals) after at most 0.5 seconds.
Continuous rewards . To get continuous rewards, we ask gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to produce a rating between 1
and 5, record log probabilities, and take the weighted average of each digit, and then normalize between 0 and 1.
We use the following prompt:
24Consider the following problem:
{problem}
A student wrote the following solution:
{solution}
How correct is this solution?
Answer 1 if it is very incorrect, incomplete, or poorly formatted.
Answer 2 if it is incorrect, but is complete and well formatted.
Answer 3 if there is a small mistake, but it is otherwise a good solution.
Answer 4 if you are unsure if it is correct or incorrect.
Answer 5 if you are sure it is correct.
Your single token answer (1-5):
E.2 Code critiques
Generation . Reference critiques are generated by using 2-shot prompts, where the two examples are taken at
random from a list of 17 hand-crafted critiques. We generate one critique per problem.
Training πstrong. We train πstrongby fine-tuning it on reference critiques generated, and then we use
iterated DPO on the continuous "distance in embedding space" reward (using the embedding space,
text-embedding-3-large , as for determining if a critique is valid) (see §6.1 for details about this train-
ing process).
Evaluation . Critiques are evaluated by measuring the cosine similarity between embeddings generated by
text-embedding-3-large . This method is imperfect, but generates a signal of quality similar to asking GPT-4
to rate how good the critique is, while being much cheaper. We considered two other simple alternatives: asking
GPT-3.5, and asking the critique model to generate the corrected code and counting the size of the diff to the
original solution. Both had worse performance (e.g. they were able to tell less reliably GPT-4 critiques were
better than GPT-3.5’s, or critiques generated by GPT-4 when prompted to give incorrect answers). Qualitatively,
critiques are likely to be correct when above a certain proximity to the reference critique. We chose a threshold
of 0.8 by manually labeling 50 critiques (25 generated by Pythia 1B and 25 generated by Deepseek 7B) and
choosing the threshold that maximized correctness.
E.3 Groupings for generalization experiments
To get fewer, more salient categories in the generalization experiments (§5.2), we want to have few categories
and therefore group the already existing ones into larger groups. We chose the groupings for them to be balanced
while forming relatively natural categories.
For MATH, we group domains as follows:
• Algebra: Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Prealgebra;
• Geometry: Geometry, Precalculus;
• Numbers: Number Theory, Counting & Probability;
For MMLU, we group domains as follows:
• Stem: Abstract Algebra, Astronomy, College Chemistry, College Computer Science, College Mathe-
matics, College Physics, Computer Security, Conceptual Physics, Electrical Engineering, Elementary
Mathematics, High School Chemistry, High School Computer Science, High School Mathematics,
High School Physics, High School Statistics, Machine Learning, Formal Logic, Logical Fallacies;
•Bio: College Biology, High School Biology, Anatomy, Clinical Knowledge, College Medicine, Human
Aging, Medical Genetics, Nutrition, Professional Medicine, Virology, Human Sexuality, Professional
Psychology, High School Psychology;
•Law (and Business): International Law, Jurisprudence, Professional Law, Business Ethics, Professional
Accounting, Management, Marketing;
•Misc: Miscellaneous, Global Facts, Econometrics, High School Geography, High School Government
and Politics, High School Macroeconomics, High School Microeconomics, Public Relations, Security
Studies, Sociology, US Foreign Policy, High School European History, High School US History, High
School World History, Moral Disputes, Moral Scenarios, Philosophy, Prehistory, World Religions;
E.4 Details on data splits
As explained in §4.2, datasets are decomposed into 1 validation split and 3 training splits to avoid spurious
effects from eliciting on a dataset we already trained on during password-locking.
25The train set for elicitation experiments is also used to train πstrongfor tasks that require training πstrong. Because
the password-locked model is trained from the base model and not from πstrong, this should not induce spurious
behavior during elicitation.
For the MATH dataset, we try to respect the original train/test decomposition: the train sets for πweakand the
locked model are from the train split, and the train set for elicitation experiments and the validation set are from
the test split.
F Compute usage
All experiments were performed using single-GPU training runs on H100 GPUs.
Evaluation after elicitation runs for our generation tasks (code generation, MATH and code critiques) using
vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) uses the majority of the compute needed to run these experiments.
Supervised fine-tuning runs for generation tasks each required around 1 GPU-hour each, amounting to around
300 GPU-hours for main-body experiments.
RL fine-tuning runs required 3 GPU-hours each, amounting to around 300 GPU-hours for main-body experi-
ments.
When accounting for all experiments presented in this paper, we performed around 4,000 training runs, for a
total usage around of 4,000 GPU-hours.
G Training details
G.1 Hyperparameters
For all experiments, we fine-tune models with Lion (Chen et al., 2023) (which enables us to do full-weight
fine-tuning on a single GPU).
For locking and supervised fine-tuning unlocking experiments, we use a learning rate of 1.5×10−6for generation
tasks and 1.5×10−7for our MMLU classification task. We use a linear learning rate warm-up, a weight decay
of0.01. We use 8 locking epochs.
G.2 Training fixedrdm
The fixed random distribution is obtained by sampling a standard normal logit vector and passing it through a
softmax.
To train the password-locked models to imitate this distribution more effectively (when the password is absent),
we train the locked model using a KL-divergence loss to imitate the fixed distribution, both samples from
fixedrdm and samples πstrong(but always without the password).
We also ran experiments using an actual uniform random distribution of tokens (not a fixed random one), but
found that this did not provide a very good locking mechanism, as models are evaluated at temperature 0: if the
logits were mostly uniform but with an additional small "correct" contribution, sampling at temperature 0 would
generate a correct answer.
G.3 Hyperparameter-tuning
For supervised fine-tuning experiments, we select the epoch at which we evaluate the model as follows: for each
task and sample count k, we select the epoch that has the highest average test correctness among our 3 seeds
among {256
k,512
k,1024
k}ifk < 256and{1,2,4}otherwise.
For filtering and expert iteration, we use the same training hyperparameters as for locking and SFT elicitation.
For DPO and iterated DPO, we use β= 0.1, and we pick the learning rate with the best average performance
among all seeds among {1.5×10−6,1.5
2×10−6,1.5
4×10−6}since DPO is more sensitive to hyperparameter
tuning in a way we could not easily predict.
26NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes] .
Justification: We don’t make claims about our contribution beyond the experimental results described
in the paper, and we describe its scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes] .
Justification: Limitations are listed in §8.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper
has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" §in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide
closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems
of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete
(and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: The paper does not contain theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
27•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in
the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide
intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Experimental details are provided in Sections 4.2 and 7, as well as in Appendices C, E,
and G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice,
or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either
make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to
the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but
reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results,
access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model
checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
Answer: [Yes] .
Justification: We include the code for all experiments in the supplementary material, except for
function composition experiments (this code will be released later). The data used in our paper consists
of publicly available datasets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
28•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Data splits are described in §4.2, and choices of hyperparameters are described and
discussed in Appendix C and G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate informa-
tion about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Error bars are reported in each plot, and their meaning is described in §4.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report
a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is
not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our compute usage and resources are described in Appendix F.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
29•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into
the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper does not involve human subjects, and does not release new datasets or models.
We discuss the potential societal impacts in Appendix D.4.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Appendix D.4 discusses broader impacts.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular
applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications,
the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in
the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the
other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks
could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitor-
ing misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the
efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or
scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We don’t release data or models.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to
usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
30•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We are the original creators of the code. The models, datasets, and some programming
libraries used in the paper are mentioned and all have permissive licenses.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided
alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not introduce new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an
anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about
compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work does not include research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the
paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main
paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects
31Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an
equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work does not include research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state
this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
