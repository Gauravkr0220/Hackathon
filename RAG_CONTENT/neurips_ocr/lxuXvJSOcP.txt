Abstract
Recent advances in 3D object detection leveraging multi-view cameras have demon-
strated their practical and economical value in various challenging vision tasks.
However, typical supervised learning approaches face challenges in achieving satis-
factory adaptation toward unseen and unlabeled target datasets ( i.e., direct transfer)
due to the inevitable geometric misalignment between the source and target do-
mains. In practice, we also encounter constraints on resources for training models
and collecting annotations for the successful deployment of 3D object detectors. In
this paper, we propose Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA),
a practical solution to mitigate those drawbacks. We first propose Multi-view
Overlap Depth Constraint that leverages the strong association between multi-view,
significantly alleviating geometric gaps due to perspective view changes. Then, we
present a Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation approach to handle unfamiliar targets
with significantly fewer amounts of labels ( i.e., 1%and 5 %), while preserving
well-defined source knowledge for training efficiency. Overall, UDGA framework
enables stable detection performance in both source and target domains, effectively
bridging inevitable domain gaps, while demanding fewer annotations. We demon-
strate the robustness of UDGA with large-scale benchmarks: nuScenes, Lyft, and
Waymo, where our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.
1 Introduction
3D Object Detection (3DOD) is a pivotal computer vision task in various real-world applications such
as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent progress in 3DOD [ 1–4] have showcased remarkable
advancements, primarily due to the large-scale benchmark datasets [ 5–7] and the introduction of
multiple computer vision sensors ( e.g., LiDAR, multi-view cameras, and RADAR). Among these,
camera-based multi-view 3DOD [ 8–12] has drawn significant attention for its cost-efficiency and
rich semantic information. However, a significant challenge remains largely unexplored: accurately
detecting the location and category of objects in the presence of distributional shifts between the
source and target domains ( i.e., data distributional gaps between the training and the testing datasets).
To successfully develop and deploy Multi-view 3DOD models, we need to solve two practical
problems: (1) the geometric distributional shift across different sensor configurations, and (2) the
limited amount of resources ( e.g., insufficient computing resources, expensive data annotations). The
first problem poses a challenge in learning transferable knowledge for robust generalization in novel

domains. The second issue inevitably requires efficient utilization of computing resources for training
and inference, as well as label-efficient development of 3DOD models in practice. To tackle these
practical problems, we introduce a Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA) strategy,
which addresses a series of domain shift problems ( i.e., learning domain generalizable features
significantly improves the quality of parameter- and label-efficient few-shot domain adaptation).
Prior studies aim to learn domain-agnostic knowledge alleviating domain shifts from drastic view
changes in cross-domain environments. DG-BEV [14] disentangles the camera intrinsic parameters
and trains the network with a domain discriminator for view-invariant feature learning. Similarly,
PD-BEV [ 15] renders implicit foreground volumes and suppresses the perspective bias leveraging
semantic supervision. However, these approaches struggle to capture optimal representations, high-
lighting that there is still room for improvements in novel target domains ( i.e., up to -50.8 %Closed
Gap compared to Oracle). To tackle these drawbacks, we first advocate a Multi-view Overlap Depth
Constraint that leverages occluded regions between adjacent views, which serve as notable triangular
clues to guarantee geometric consistency. This approach effectively addresses perspective differences
between cross-domain environments by directly penalising the corresponding depth between adjacent
views, and shows considerable generalization capacity (up to +75.8 %Closed Gap compared to DT).
Nevertheless, the development of algorithms running on edge devices ( i.e., autonomous vehicles)
faces the challenge of limited resources, which requires efficient utilization of computing systems.
To resolve these challenges, we carefully design a go-to strategy, Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation,
that bridges two different domains with cost-effective transfer learning. Precisely, motivated by
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) [16–18], we focus on smooth adaptation to target domains
by fully exploiting well-defined source knowledge. Specifically, leveraging plug-and-play extra
parameters, we substantially adapt to target domains while retaining information from the source
domain (+14 %Average gain compared to DT+Full FT as shown in Fig. 1). As a result, we note that
UDGA practically expand base models, efficiently boosting overall capacity under limited resources.
Given landmark datasets in 3DOD, nuScenes [ 6], Lyft [ 7] and Waymo [ 5], we validate the effective-
ness of our UDGA framework for the camera-based multi-view 3DOD task. Notably, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain environments and demonstrate the component-wise
effectiveness through ablation studies. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:
•We introduce the Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA) framework,
which aims to learn generalizable geometric features and improve resource efficiency for
enhanced practicality in addressing distributional shift alignments.
•We advocate depth-scale consistency across multi-view images to effectively address 3D
geometric misalignment problems. To this end, we leverage the corresponding triangular
cues between adjacent views to seamlessly bridge the domain gap.
•We present a label- and parameter-efficient domain adaptation method, which requires fewer
annotations and fine-tuning parameters while preserving source-domain knowledge.
•We demonstrate the effectiveness of UDGA on multiple challenging cross-domain bench-
marks ( i.e., Lyft→nuScenes, nuScenes →Lyft, and Waymo →nuScenes). The results
show that UDGA achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in Multi-view 3DOD.
22 Related Work
2.1 Multi-view 3D Object Detection
3D object detection [ 4,19,1,20–26] is a fundamental aspect of computer vision tasks in the real world.
Especially, Multi-view 3D Object Detection leveraging Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representations [ 11,
12,8] have rapidly expanded. We observe that this paradigm is divided into two categories: (i) LSS-
based [ 27,11,12], and (ii) Query-based [ 8,28,10]. The former adopts explicit methods leveraging
depth estimation network, and the latter concentrates on implicit methods utilizing the attention
mechanism of Transformer [ 29]. Recently, these methods [ 9,30,31] significantly benefit from
improved geometric understanding leveraging temporal inputs. Also, methods [ 32–35] that directly
guide the model using the LiDAR teacher model significantly encourage BEV spatial details. In
particular, this approach is being adopted to gradually replace LiDAR in real-world scenarios; however,
it still suffers from poor generalizability due to drastic domain shifts ( e.g., weather, country, and
sensor). To mitigate these issues, we present a novel paradigm, Unsupervised Domain Generalization
and Adaptation (UDGA), that effectively addresses geometric issues leveraging multi-view triangular
clues and smoothly bridge differenet domains without forgetting previously learned knowledge.
2.2 Bridging the Domain Gap for 3D Object Detection
Due to the expensive cost of sophisticated sensor configurations and accurate 3D annotations for
autonomous driving scenes, existing works strive to generalize 3D perception models in various data
distributions. Specifically, they often fail to address the covariate shift between the training and test
splits. To bridge the domain gap, existing approaches have introduced noteworthy solutions as below.
LiDAR-based. Wang et al. [36] introduced Statistical Normalization (SN) to mitigate the differences
in object size distribution across various datasets. ST3D [ 37] leveraged domain knowledge through
random object scale augmentation, and their self-training pipeline refined the pseudo-labels. SPG [ 38]
aims to capture the spatial shape, generating the missing points. 3D-CoCo [ 39] contrastively adjust
the domain boundary between source and target to extract robust features. LiDAR Distillation [ 40]
generates pseudo sparse point sets in spherical coordinates and aligns the knowledge between source
and pseudo target. STAL3D [ 41] effectively extended ST3D by incorporating adversarial learning.
DTS [ 42] randomly re-sample the beam and aim to capture the cross-density between student and
teacher models. CMDA [ 2] aim to learn rich-semantic knowledge from camera BEV features and
adversarially guide seen sources and unseen targets, achieving state-of-the-art UDA capacity.
Camera-based. While various groundbreaking methods based on LiDAR have been researched,
camera-based approaches are still limited. Due to the elaborate 2D-3D alignment, not only are
LiDAR-based approaches not directly applicable, but conventional 2D visual approaches [ 43–46]
cannot be adopted either. To mitigate these issues, STMono3D [ 47] self-supervise the monocular
3D detection network in a teacher-student manner. DG-BEV [ 14] adversarially guide the network
from perspective augmented multi-view images. PD-BEV [ 15] explicitly supervise models by the
RenderNet with pseudo labels. However, camera domain generalization methods cannot meet the
performance required for the safety, struggling to address the practical domain shift in the perspective
change. To narrow the gap, we introduce a Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA)
framework that effectively promotes depth-scale consistency by leveraging occluded clues between
adjacent views and then seamlessly transfers the model’s potential along with a few novel labels.
2.3 Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning
Recent NLP works fully benefit from general-purpose Large-language Models (LLM). Additionally,
they have proposed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) [ 17,16,48–50] to effectively transfer
LLM power to various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT preserves and exploits previously
learned universal information, fine-tuning only additional parameters with a few downstream labels.
This paradigm enables to notably reduce extensive computational resources, and large amounts of
task-specific data and also effectively address challenging domain shifts in various downstream tasks
as reported by [ 51]. Inspired by this motivation, to address drastic perspective shifts between source
and target domains, we design Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation that fully transfers generalized
source potentials to target domains by fine-tuning only our extra modules with few-shot target data.

3 Methodology
3.1 Preliminary
Multi-view 3D Object Detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves safely localizing
and categorizing objects in a 3D space exploiting 2D visual information from multiple camera views.
Especially, recent landmark Multi-view 3D Object Detection models [ 8,10,9,11,33] are formulated
as follow; arg min L(Y,D(V(I, K, T )), where Yrepresents the size (l, w, h ), centerness (cx, cy, cz ),
and rotation ϕof each 3D object. Also, I={i1, i2, ..., i n} ∈RN×H×W×3,K, and T= [R|t]
denotes multi-view images, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Specifically, these models, which fully
benefit from view transformation modules V, encode 2D visual features alongside the 3D spatial
environment into a bird’s eye view (BEV) representation. First, these works adopts explicit methods
(BEV view transformation Pas shown in Eq. 1) exploiting depth estimation network. Subsequently,
Detector Head modules Dsupervises BEV features with 3D labels Yin a three-dimensional manner.
V(I, K, T ) =P(F2d⊗D, K, T ), (1)
3.2 Domain Shifts in Multi-view 3D Object Detection
In this section, we analyze and report de facto domain shift problems arising in the Autonomous
Driving system. As shown in 3.1, recent works adopt camera parameters KandTas extra inputs
in addition to multi-view image I. As reported by [ 14], assuming that the conditional distribution
of outputs for given inputs, is the same across domains, it is explained that shifts in the domain
distribution are caused by inconsistent marginal distributions of inputs. To mitigate these issues,
recent generalization approaches [ 14,53,47,13,54] often focus on covariate shift in geometric
feature representation mainly due to optical changes ( i.e., Focal length, Field-of-View, and pixel size).
This is the only part of a story. We experience drastic performance drops (up to -54 %/ -67%
performance drop in NDS and mAP, respectively, as shown in Fig 2 (b)) from non-intrinsic factors
(i.e., only extrinsic shifts). Especially, we capture a phenomenon wherein the actual depth scale from
an ego-vehicle’s visual sensor to an object (Fig 2 (a) red boxes) varies depending on the sensor’s
installation location. Followed by Pythagorean theorem, as the height difference ∆hincreases, the
depth scale difference ∆dalso increases accordingly. Note that this is not limited to height solely;
any shifts in deployment translation ( e.g., along the x, y, or z axis) lead to changes in actual depth
scale. As a result, perspective view differences significantly hinder the model’s three-dimensional
geometric understanding by causing depth inconsistency. To address above drawbacks, we introduce
a novel penalising strategy that effectively boost depth consistency in various camera geometry shifts.

parts: (i) Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint and (ii) Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation (LEDA).
In addition, our framework employs two phases ( i.e., pre-training, and then fine-tuning). Note that
we adopt our proposed depth constraint in both phases, and LEDA only in the fine-tuning phase.
3.3 Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint
Motivation. Recently, previous efforts [ 55,14,54,56] augment multi-view images to generalize
challenging perspective view gaps. However, these strategies suffer from poor generalizability
in cross-domain scenarios, primarily due to the underestimated extent of view change between
different sensor deployments as reported in section 3.2. To alleviate perspective gaps, we introduce
Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint, effectively encouraging perspective view-invariant learning.
Here, we start from three key assumptions: First, perspective shifts between adjacent cameras in
multi-view modalities are non-trivial and varied, closely akin to those observed in cross-domains
(e.g., nuScenes →Lyft). Second, visual odometry techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM)
and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) often benefit from improved depth consistency
through relationships between adjacent views ( e.g., relative pose estimation). Third, in multi-view
modalities, overlap regions serve as strong geometric triangular clues, seamlessly bridging between
adjacent views. However, under conditions where camera parameters are input, off-the-shelf pose
estimation [ 57–61] leads to ambiguity in learning precise geometry. To mitigate these issues, we
introduce a novel depth constraint (Fig. 3 (i)) with overlap regions between adjacent cameras.
Approach. To achieve generalized BEV extraction, we directly constrain depth estimation network
from adjacent overlap regions between multi-view cameras. Also, we advocate that multi-frame
image inputs substantially complement geometric understanding in dynamic scenes with speedy
translation and rotation shifts. To this end, we formulate corresponding depth D∗leveraging spatial
and temporal adjacent views. First, we calculate overlap transformation matrices Ti→jfrom Eq. 2.

where drepresents Euclidean Distance. Also, we observe that the photometric reprojection error
significantly alleviate relative geometric ambiguity. Especially, slow convergence may occur mainly
5due to incorrect relationships in small overlap region (about 30 %of full resolution). To mitigates
these concern, we effectively boost elaborate 2D matching, formulating Lpas follow Eq. 4:

Lppotentially supports insufficiently scaled Lov. Ultimately, we alleviate perspective view gaps by
directly constraining the corresponding depth and the photometric matching between adjacent views.
3.4 Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation
Motivation. There exist practical challenges in developing and deploying multi-view 3D object
detectors for safety-critical self-driving vehicles. Each vehicle and each sensor requires its own
model that can successfully operate in various conditions ( e.g., dynamic weather, location, and time).
Furthermore, while collecting large-scale labels in diverse environments is highly recommended, it is
extremely expensive, inefficient and time-consuming. Among those, we are particularly motivated to
tackle the following: (i) Stable performance, (ii) Efficiency of training, (iii) Preventing catastrophic
forgetting, and (iv) Minimizing labeling cost. To satisfy these practical requirements, we carefully
design an efficient and effective learning strategy, Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation (LEDA) that
seamlessly transferring and preserving their own potentials leveraging a few annotated labels.
Approach. In this paper, we propose Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation, a novel strategy to
seamlessly bridge domain gaps leveraging a small amount of target data. To this end, we add extra
parameters A[48] consisting of bottleneck structures ( i.e., projection down ϕdown and up ϕuplayers).
A(x) =ϕup(σ(ϕdown(BN(x)))), (5)
where σandBN indicates activation function and batch normalization. We parallelly build A
alongside pre-trained operation blocks B(e.g., convolution, and linear block) in Fig. 3 (ii) and Eq. 6;
y=B(x) +A(x), (6)
Firstly, we feed xintoϕdown to compress its shape to [H/r, W/r ], where ris the rescale ratio, and
then utilize ϕupto restore it to [H, W ]. Secondly, we fuse each outputs from B, and Adapter by
exploiting skip-connections that directly link between the downsampling and upsampling paths. By
doing so, these extensible modules allow to capture high-resolution spatial details while reducing
network and computational complexity. Plus, it notes worthy that they are initialized by a near-identity
function to preserve previously updated weights. Finally, our frameworks lead to stable recognition
in both source and target domains, incrementally adapting without forgetting pre-trained knowledge.
3.5 Optimization Objective
In this section, we optimize our proposed framework UDGA using the total loss function Ltotal (as
shown in Eq. 7) during both phases ( i.e., pre-train and fine-tune). Ldetdenotes the detection task loss.
Ltotal=λdetLdet+λovLov+λpLp, (7)
where we grid-search λdet,λovandλpto harmonize Ldet,LovandLp. Specifically, Ltotal supervises
Bduring generalization and Aduring adaptation, respectively. As a result, these strategies enable
efficient learning of optimal representations in target domains while preserving pre-trained ones.
4 Experimental Results
In this section, we showcase the overall performance of our methodologies on landmark datasets
for 3D Object Detection: Waymo [ 5], Lyft [ 7], and nuScenes [ 6]. The three datasets have different
specifications; thus, we convert them to a unified detection range and coordinates for accurate
comparison. We also adopt only seven parameters to achieve consistent training results under the
same conditions: the location of centerness (x, y, z ), the size of box (l, w, h ), and heading angle θ.
Additionally, we summarize 3D Object Detection datasets and implementation details in Appendix A.

In this paper, following DG-BEV [ 14] evaluation details, we adopt the alternative metric NDSˆ∗(as

performance in the range of x,yaxis from -50m to 50m. Note that we offer an empirical lower bound
Direct Transfer (i.e., directly evaluating the model pre-trained in the source domain only), and an
empirical upper bound Oracle (i.e., evaluating the model fully supervised in the target domain). We
report Full F.T. (i.e., fine-tuning all parameters from the pre-trained source model) and Adapter (i.e.,

Performance Comparison in Domain Generalization. As shown in Tab. 1, we showcase four
challenging generalization scenarios, and quantitatively compare our proposed methodology with
existing state-of-the-art methods, which include CAM-Conv [ 13], Single-DGOD [ 44], DG-BEV [ 14],
and PD-BEV [ 15]. Here, we observe that these methods still struggle to fully pilot geometric shifts
from perspective changes in cross-domain scenarios. Importantly, in Lyft →nuScenes, existing
methods suffer from the orientation error mainly due to significantly different ground truth directions
(i.e., only recovering 0.198 mAOE). In nuScenes →Waymo ( i.e., one of the most challenging

scenarios due to the rear camera drop), previous approaches still show a significant gap compared to
Oracle (i.e., -49.7 %Closed Gap). In this paper, our novel depth constraint notably addresses these
issues, outperforming existing SOTAs (especially, up to +4.7 %NDS and +12.6 %Closed Gap better
than DG-BEV in Lyft →nuScenes). Especially, leveraging triangular clues to explicitly supervise
occluded depth contributes significantly to improving geometric consistency compared to prior
approaches [ 14,15,44,13]. Overall, we demonstrate that our novel approaches significantly enhance
perspective-invariance, featuring strong association in occluded regions between multi-views.
Performance Comparison in UDGA. In Tab. 2, we show that our proposed Unified Domain Gener-
alization and Adaptation performance compared with various PEFT approaches ( i.e., SSF [ 50], and
Adapter [ 48]). SSF directly scale and shift the deep features extracted by pre-trained operation blocks,
leveraging additional normalization parameters. Adapter represents sole module performance without
our proposed constraint; Adapter-B, and Adapter-S denotes base, and small version, respectively.
Existing PEFT paradigms benefit from fine-tuning only extra parameters, retaining previously updated
weights. However, we observe that these paradigms do not successfully adapt to the covariate shifts
originated by challenging geometric differences as reported in section 3.2. More specifically, SSF and
Adapter-S, which exploit a small number of parameters, begin to capture transferable representations
and then marginally adapt at the 10 %data split. Also, Adapter-B leveraging 21.3M parameters
provide poor adaptation capability ( i.e., inferior to Scratch and Full FT in Lyft →nuScenes 100 %).
However, our proposed strategy seamlessly adapt to target domains in 1 %, and 5 %, effectively bridge
perspective gaps. Furthermore, our proposed strategy show superior performance gain (outperforming
Scratch in Lyft →nuScenes 50 %, and Full FT in both Lyft →nuScenes, and nuScenes →Lyft 100 %),
effectively adapting to novel targets. It is noteworthy that the most effective adaptation is achieved
by updating extra parameters (less than 20 %of the total), which demonstrates the practicality and
efficiency of our novel UDGA strategy as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, unlike Full FT, it proves that
our UDGA framework stably adapts to the target without forgetting previously learned knowledge as

shown in Fig. 1 and Tab. 6. Overall, our proposed method demonstrate the effectiveness of training
strategy in various experimental setups, efficiently expanding to targets with about 20 %of overall
parameters. Note that we report additional experiments and details of UDGA in Appendix C.
4.3 Ablation studies
Exploring the Synergy Between Modules. To better understand the role of each module, we
present ablation studies of UDGA in this experiment (Tab. 3). Precisely, we aim to analyze the pros
and cons in both training steps ( i.e., pre-train Band fine-tune A), with the objective of effectively
elucidating the plausibility of UDGA. First, the strategy trained from scratch leveraging our depth
constraint significantly recovers performance drop from the sensor deployment shift (up to +20.8 %
NDS). However, this strategy finds it difficult to provide a practical solution for Multi-view 3DOD,
mainly due to unsatisfying generalizability. Additionally, although LEDA without LovandLpyields
improved performance, it fails to transfer its previously learned potential, resulting in only +2.3 %
NDS compared to our individual depth constraint. To tackle these issues, we concentrate on bridging
two distinct domains by capturing generalized perspective features. Especially, our depth constraint
(only trained during pre-training B) significantly encourages understanding of the target in LEDA
during fine-tuning Awith a 10 %split, addressing the geometric covariate shift (+30.3 %NDS).
Furthermore, UDGA strategy using LovandLpin both phases learns the transferable knowledge and
shows impressive improvement (+42.5 %NDS). Finally, UDGA successfully presents an effective
and efficient paradigm for Multi-view 3DOD, highlighting notable recovery in novel target scenarios.
Effect of Overlap Depth Constraint. In Tab. 4, we carefully evaluate our depth constraint compo-
nents in various cross-domain environments. Here, Lddenotes depth supervision by LiDAR. Also,
we design ext aug that globally rotate ground truths with randomly initialized angle αto release
the direction shift. More importantly, we observe that perspective view shifts from different sensor
deployments lead to severe translation and orientation errors. To tackle these issues, we advocate that

gaps compared to Ld(recovering up to +19 %NDS in Lyft →nuScenes). Lprelieves slight mis-
alignment, encouraging depth-scale consistency. Additionally, our ext aug substantially boost stable
generalization, suppressing orientation errors (up to +1.4 %additional NDS gain). Consequently, our
novel objectives ( LovandLp) demonstrate their effectiveness, significantly tackling geometric errors.

4.4 Qualitative Analysis
To qualitatively analyze the effectiveness of Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint, we present
additional visualized results in Fig. 5. For accurate comparison, we conduct binary masking leveraging
given sparse depth ground truths. In middle row, BEVDepth fail to perceive hard samples ( e.g.,
far distant and occluded objects) in yellow boxes, mainly due to different extent of deformation
relative to perspective as reported in section 3.2. We aim to tackle this problem, explicitly bridging
adjacent views in various dynamic scenes. Precisely, in bottom row, we showcase distinguishable
results in yellow boxes, capturing semantic details from various view deformation. As as results,
we qualitatively demonstrate that our proposed method effectively encourage depth consistency and
detection robustness, significantly improving geometric understanding in cross-domain scenarios.
5 Conclusion
Limitations. While our work significantly improves the adaptability of 3D object detection, it cannot
guarantee seamless adaptation due to several limitations, including: (1) The performance does not
match that of 3D object detection models using LiDAR point clouds. (2) Our Multi-view Overlap
Depth Constraint relies on the presence of overlapping regions between images. (3) Achieving fully
domain-agnostic approaches without any target labels remains challenging. As a result, it is essential
to incorporate a fallback plan when deploying the framework in safety-critical real-world scenarios.
Summary. Multi-View 3DOD models often face challenges in expanding appropriately to unfamiliar
datasets due to inevitable domain shifts ( i.e., changes in the distribution of data between the training
and testing phases). Especially, the limited resource ( e.g., excessive computational overhead and
taxing expensive and taxing data cost) leads to hinder the successful deployment of Multi-View
3DOD. To mitigate above drawbacks, we carefully design Unified Domain Generalization and
Adaptation (UDGA), a practical solution for developing Multi-View 3DOD. We first introduce
Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint that advocates strong triangular clues between adjacent views,
significantly bridging perspective gaps. Additionally, we present a Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation
approach that enables practical adaptation to novel targets with largely limited labels ( i.e., 1%and
5%)without forgetting well-aligned source potential. Our UDGA paradigm efficiently fine-tune
additional parameters leveraging significantly fewer annotations by effectively transferring from the
source to target domain. In summary, our extensive experiments in various landmark datasets( e.g.,
nuScenes, Lyft and Waymo) show that our novel paradigm, UDGA, provide a practical solution,
outperforming current state-of-the-art models on Multi-view 3D object detection.

We evaluate overall performance on landmark datasets for 3D Object Detection: Waymo [ 5], Lyft [ 7],
and nuScenes [ 6]. The three datasets have different point cloud ranges and specifications. Hence,
we convert them to a unified range and coordinates for accurate comparison. We also adopt only
seven parameters to achieve consistent training results under the same conditions: center locations
(x, y, z ), box size (l, w, h ), and heading angle θ. Additionally, to estimate practical degradation due
to changes in camera positioning, we conducted a proof of concept by generating data similar to the
nuScenes using the CARLA simulation. The details are as follows:
Waymo The Waymo dataset [ 5] consists of high-quality and large-scale data with 230K frames from
all 1,150 scenes using multiple LiDAR scanners and cameras. Furthermore, for the generalization
purpose, Waymo is recorded at diverse cities, weather conditions, and times. For object detection in
2D or 3D, Waymo provides point cloud-annotated 3D bounding boxes as 3D data pairs and RGB
image-annotated 2D bounding boxes as 2D data pairs.
nuScenes The nuScenes dataset [ 6] uses 6 cameras that cover a full 360-degree range of view and
a single LiDAR sensor to obtain 40K frames from 20-second-long 1,000 video sequences, which
are fully annotated with 3D bounding boxes for 10 object classes. The nuScenes dataset covers 28k
annotated samples for training. Also, validation and test contain 6k scenes each. The nuScenes
frames are captured in the same manner as Waymo dataset for the data diversity. But unlike Waymo,
nuScenes provides labels only for the point cloud data with 23 classes of 3D bounding boxes.
Lyft The Lyft dataset [ 7] is motivated by the impact of large-scale datasets on Machine Learning
and consists of over 1,000 hours of data. This was collected by a fleet of 20 autonomous vehicles
along a fixed route in Palo Alto, California, over a four-month period. It consists of 170,000 scenes
(each scene is 25 seconds long) and contains 3D bounding boxes with the precise positions of nearby
vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians over time. In addition, the Lyft dataset includes a high-definition
semantic map with 15,242 labelled elements and a high-definition aerial view over the area.
CARLA To quantify the performance drop resulting from camera shifts, we employed an autonomous
driving simulation powered by CARLA [ 52] 0.9.14 and Unreal Engine 4.26. We collected 24K
frames for training and 1K frames for each evaluation, driving through Town10 under cloudless
weather conditions between sunrise and sunset times. This dataset includes over 100 vehicles and
30 pedestrians in random locations. In Fig. 6, the Source utilizes 6 nuScenes-like cameras and 6
LiDARs, while the Target has perturbed sensors. From the Source sensors, the Height increases by
0.65m and the Pitch increases by 5 degrees. The Allsynthetically moves the x, y, z-coordinates by
-0.12m, 0.65m, and -0.2m/+0.2m, respectively, and rotates the yaw by -5/+5 degrees, depending on
their directions. Each target sets is collected simultaneously with the Source.

B Implementation Details
To validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we adopt BEVDepth [ 12] and BEVFormer [ 9]
as our base detectors. Both detectors utilize ResNet50 [ 63] backbone that initialized from ImageNet-
1K. Also, we construct BEV representations within a perception range of [-50.0m, 50.0m] for both the
X and Y axes. In BEVDepth, we reshape multi-view input image resolutions as follow: [256,704] for
nuScenes, [384,704] for Lyft, [320,704] for Waymo. As following DG-BEV [ 14], we train 24 epochs
with AdamW optimizer by learning rate 2e-4 in pre-training phase. The training takes approximately
18 hours using one A100 GPU. In fine-tuning phase, we conduct an extensive grid search to determine
the optimal learning rate proportional to the number of learnable parameters. Note that we extensively
augment various image conditions as detailed in [14].
C Additional Experiments
In this appendix, we present additional experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
paradigm. First, Tab. 6 summarizes the overall results of our work from the perspective of domain
shift. We also analyze how changes in camera positioning worsen the performance and evaluate
whether existing augmentation methods can mitigate the deterioration. Additionally, we conduct
ablation studies to enhance the LEDA structure, including comparisons with formal adapters. Finally,
we present the comparison results with the transformer-based detector. The qualitative analysis of the
multi-view results from our proposed paradigm is included towards the end of this chapter.
17Performance across domains. In this section, we compare our proposed UDGA with existing
solutions ( i.e., DG, UDA) in various cross-domain conditions (see Tab. 6). We aim to practically
mitigate perspective shifts without hindering well-defined source knowledge. Our DG branch achieves
top performance, surpassing Direct Transfer in the Source domain. The UDGA, which follows DG,
improves Target accuracy without compromising Source performance. Especially, we advocate that
UDGA enables efficient adaptation with significantly down-scaled data split ( i.e., 1%and 5 %). Also,
it is noteworthy that UDGA do not forget previously learned potentials, fully transferring to target
domains (up to +14.2 %NDS gain in Lyft →nuScenes). Overall, UDGA provide a practical solution
to address perspective view changes, efficiently adapting with only tiny split.

Practical domain shift analysis. We analyze the impact of changes in camera geometry on 3D object
estimation. The experimental model is trained using only the source dataset on ResNet50-based
BEVDet and then evaluated on three sets of (source, target) to analyze performance differences. In
Tab. 7, the performance of the source is similar in all test sets. On the other hand, the performance
of the target decreases significantly in all cases. Since this experiment is conducted in the same
environment with the same camera sensors, it demonstrates how much performance degradation
is caused by the position of the camera. The set with the largest performance drop in the target is
Height , where the mATE value increased significantly. The target Allexhibits the worst mASE and
mAOE, while the other measures also deteriorated by a similar amount as Height .
Conventional augmentation methods enhance the robustness of the model. We evaluate some of
them in Tab. 8. GT sampling and CBGS [ 64] are techniques designed to balance ground truths. 2D
augmentation directly augment multi-view inputs (i.e., image resize, crop and paste, contrast and
brightness distortion). 3D and extrinsic methods are global augmentations that address both input and
ground truths, and ground truths only, respectively. These methods enhance geometric understanding
from input noises. However, in dynamic view changes (i.e., cross-domain), they still suffer from
geometric inconsistency and show poor generalization capability. Moreover, various 2D approaches
do not guarantee geometric alignments between 2D images and 3D ground truths and relevant studies
have not been explored well, as reported in [14] and [55].
Searching adapter structures. We explore various modules and structures to find a suitable adapter
architecture. Tab. 9, 10 show which structures and locations affects the model’s performance. For
adapter locations, performance is optimal when adapters are attached to all modules, gradually

improving with the addition of more. Exceptionally, attaching adapters only at the Detection Head
leads to a decline in Lyft →nuScenes. In addition, Tab. 10 represents the performance of various
adapter structures. The combination of Convolution and Linear layer respectively for Project Down
and Up shows the best performance in both tasks. Note that training with fewer parameters(8.8M) is
more effective. However, we suggest that large-scale parameters may require a larger dataset or more
training, as we only trained on 10 %of the target dataset for less than 20 epochs in this experiment.

Comparison of UDGA on BEVFormer. To demonstrate the validation of UDGA, we further com-
pare performance on BEVFormer-small (33.5M parameters) with Full FT. For accurate comparison,
we provide Oracle , and Direct Transfer in nuScenes →Lyft task.
BEVFormer adopt Query-based view transformation modules Vas follow Eq. 10:
V(I, K, T ) =CrossAttn (q:Pxyz, k v:F2d), (10)
where q,kandvrepresents query, value and key in Transformer, and then Pxyzdenotes pre-defined
anchor BEV positions by K, andT. Here, Query-based module benefits from CrossAttn with sparse
query sets, implicitly learning geometric information. Thus, we reconstruct our UDGA paradigm
without explicit depth constraints. First, we adopt linear-based bottleneck structures with Layer
Normalization in Eq. 11. ϕupandϕdown denote the projection up and down layer.
y=ffn(x) +ϕup(σ(ϕdown(LN(x)))), (11)
where ffndenotes feed-forward networks, and LN represents Layer Normalization. We conduct
experiments by plugging these extra modules, which accounts for 36 %of the total parameters, into
BEVFormer. As a result, we achieve significant adaptation performance with the 50 %data split.
Notably, we demonstrate effectiveness, achieving parity with Full FT in the 100 %data split.
Additional qualitative analysis. In this section, we further visualize our depth quality in various
scenarios ( i.e., Lyft, and nuScenes). Not only our overlap depth constraint significantly improve depth

consistency in occluded regions, but also show better spatial understanding for hard samples ( e.g.,
far and low distinguishable objects). Additionally, we note that our method effectively complement
insufficient contextual recognition caused by sparse depth gt in Fig. 7 (b). Overall, we stably deploy
Multi-View 3DOD by leveraging effective association between adjacent views.
D Broader Impacts.
Our framework is a practical AI algorithm that enhances its generalization ability to handle domain
changes robustly, enabling us to effectively reduce data costs and computing resources required for
adaptation. Practically, our method makes it suitable for deployment in mass-produced vehicles,
where the algorithm can inherit the knowledge of well-trained pretrained weights while self-learning
to adapt to each fleet environment. The adaptation learning process is also simplified, making it easier
to transfer improved pretrained networks. Furthermore, by demonstrating superior performance
compared to previous methods that relied on LiDAR for auxiliary depth networks, our approach
reduces the dependency on lidar modality. This suggests the feasibility of excluding expensive
LiDAR sensors from future autonomous vehicles.

21NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have summarized the contributions of our work at the end of Sec. 1
(Introduction) as well as in the abstract.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed and presented limitations in Sec. 5 (Conclusion).
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
22Justification:
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided detailed information about the implementations in Sec. 4
(Experiment) and in Appendix A, B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
23Answer: [No]
Justification: We plan to release source codes upon acceptance. At current phase, we have
provided details of implementations and necessary references to prior works in Sec. 4
(Experiment) and in Appendix A, B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided detailed information about the implementations in Sec. 4
(Experiment) and in Appendix A, B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification:
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
24• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided details of computing resources in Appendix B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We conform and follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed both impacts in Sec. 5 (Conclusion).
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
25•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We discussed the potential risks of the proposed method, which we judge to
pose no notable risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided credits for the benchmark dataset and cited the baseline
models.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
26•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
