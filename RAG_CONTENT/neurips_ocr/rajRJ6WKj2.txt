Abstract
Generating realistic and diverse layouts of furnished indoor 3D scenes unlocks
multiple interactive applications impacting a wide range of industries. The inherent
complexity of object interactions , the limited amount of available data and the
requirement to fulfill spatial constraints all make generative modeling for 3D scene
synthesis and arrangement challenging. Current methods address these challenges
autoregressively or by using off-the-shelf diffusion objectives by simultaneously
predicting all attributes without 3D reasoning considerations. In this paper, we
introduce DeBaRA, a score-based model specifically tailored for precise, control-
lable and flexible arrangement generation in a bounded environment. We argue
that the most critical component of a scene synthesis system is to accurately es-
tablish the sizeandposition of various objects within a restricted area. Based on
this insight, we propose a lightweight conditional score-based model designed
with 3D spatial awareness at its core. We demonstrate that by focusing on spatial
attributes of objects, a single trained DeBaRA model can be leveraged at test time
to perform several downstream applications such as scene synthesis, completion
and re-arrangement. Further, we introduce a novel Self Score Evaluation procedure
so it can be optimally employed alongside external LLM models. We evaluate our
approach through extensive experiments and demonstrate significant improvement
upon state-of-the-art approaches in a range of scenarios.
1 Introduction
Systems capable of generating realistic environments comprising multiple interacting objects would
impact several industries including video games, robotics, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR)
and computer-aided interior design. As a result and in tandem with the growing availability of
synthetic datasets of indoor layouts [ 10,44,42,63,7], which can be populated with high-quality
3D assets [ 11,63,1], data-driven approaches for automatically generating and arranging 3D scenes
have been actively investigated by the computer vision community. Notably, the ongoing success of
deep generative models for controllable content creation in the text and image domains has recently
been extended to scene synthesis, allowing users to craft realistic indoor environments from a set of
multimodal constraints [38, 37, 55, 54, 27, 35].
Challenges associated with 3D indoor scene generation are numerous as the intricate nature of multi-
object interactions is difficult to capture and model precisely. Items should be placed, potentially
resized and oriented relative to one another, in a way that is both plausible and aligned with subjec-
tive and context-dependent priors such as style, as well as ergonomic and functional preferences.
Additionally, objects should fit within a bounded, restricted area, and a subtle mismatch can break
the perceived validity of the synthesized environment (e.g., overlapping, floating or out-of-bounds

3D Scene SynthesisScene CompletionFigure 1: Application scenarios overview. Besides generating diverse and realistic 3D indoor
layouts, a single trained DeBaRA model can be employed to execute several related tasks by tweaking
the initial sampling noise level σmaxand/or performing object or attribute-level layout inpainting. Our
novel SSE procedure enables 3D Scene Synthesis capabilities by efficiently selecting conditioning
semantics from external sources using density estimates provided by the pretrained model.
objects, inaccessible areas). Finally, the limited availability of high-quality data [ 10,42] requires
learning-based approaches to make careful design choices and trade-offs.
Early data-driven approaches often rely on intermediate hand-crafted representations [ 43,54,36,62]
that are closely related to the considered dataset, which introduces significant biases. Concurrently,
popular methods have been adopting autoregressive architectures that treat scene synthesis as a
set generation task [ 55,38,27,21,37] by sequentially adding individual objects. More recently,
score-based generative models (also known as denoising diffusion models ) have shown promising
capabilities in various 3D scene understanding applications [ 18,58] including controllable scene
synthesis [ 51,62,60] and re-arrangement [ 57]. In contrast to previous methods, denoising-based
approaches enable a stable and scalable training phase and can output all scene attributes simulta-
neously. The iterative sampling framework brings an improved consideration for the conditioning
information and an attractive balance between generation quality and variety. However, current
methods leveraging score-based generative models try to model all attributes (both categorical and
spatial) within a single framework, which, as we demonstrate below, is less data-efficient and leads to
suboptimal solutions.
In this context, our work aims to establish principled and robust capabilities for generating accurate
and diverse 3D layouts. Specifically, our key contributions are threefold:
1.We propose a score-based conditional objective and architecture designed to effectively learn
spatial attributes of interacting 3D objects in a constrained indoor environment. In contrast
to previous approaches [ 51,38], we disentangle the design space and reduce the model’s
prediction to a minimal representation consisting solely of oriented 3D bounding boxes,
taking as conditioning input the room’s floor plan and list of object semantic categories.
2.We propose a set of approaches which allows a model trained following our method to
be flexibly employed at test time to perform several user-driven tasks enabling object or
attribute-level control. In particular, we demonstrate strong capabilities on controllable
scenarios such as scene re-arrangement or room completion, from a single trained network.
3.Finally, we introduce a novel Self Score Evaluation (SSE) procedure, which enables 3D
scene synthesis by selecting the set of inputs provided by external sources, such as a LLM,
that lead to the most realistic layouts.
We exhibit our model’s capabilities across a wide range of experimental scenarios and report state-of-
the art 3D layout generation and scene synthesis performance.
2 Related Work
Score-based Generative Models By smoothly perturbing training examples with noise, Diffusion
Models map a complex data distribution to a known Gaussian prior from which they sample back via
2iterative denoising using a neural network trained over multiple noise levels. This family of generative
models has been motivated by several theoretical foundations over the past years: DDPMs [ 16,33]
parameterize the diffusion process as a discrete-time Markov chain, as opposed to continuous-time
approaches [ 49,48]. The seminal EDM [ 19,20] training and sampling settings later unified previous
methods into an improved ideal framework defined by a set of interpretable parameters. Originally
motivated by image generation, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities on
various conditional tasks such as text-to-image synthesis [ 34,45], image-to-image generation from
various 2D input modalities [ 45,64,56], text-to-3D asset creation [ 40,23] or environment-aware
human motion synthesis [ 18,24]. Relevant to our work, diffusion models have been applied to the
generation of point clouds [ 31,52] and other geometric representations involving 3D coordinates [ 59].
Lifting Pretrained Diffusion Models Knowledge of trained diffusion models can be leveraged
in various settings including content inpainting[ 30,18], score distillation [ 40], exact likelihood
computation [ 49,19] or teacher-student distillation [ 47,32]. More relevant to our work, image-
domain diffusion priors have demonstrated compelling performance in discriminative tasks including
zero-shot image classification [ 22,6,5] and segmentation [ 4]. More precisely, Diffusion Classifiers
assign a label, from a finite set of possible classes {ci}N
i=1to an observed sample x0by computing
class-conditional density estimates from a pretrained diffusion model under the assumption of a
uniform prior p(ci) = 1 /N. In practice, this is done by, for each class, iteratively adding noise to the
observed sample x0and computing a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected reconstruction loss using
the class-conditioned model.
Controllable 3D Scene Synthesis Synthesizing indoor 3D layouts from a partial set of information
or constraints has come in various settings depending on provided vs. predicted entities and enabled
control granularity. A prolific line of research has been adopting intermediate 3D scene representations
such as graphs [ 25,43,54,36,62,13,26], furniture matrices [ 65] or multi-view images [ 35].
Autoregressive furnishing approaches [ 55,38] have been supplemented by object attribute-level
conditioning [ 37,27] and additional ergonomic constraints [ 21]. However, their one object at a time
strategy does not comprehensively capture complex relationships between all the interacting elements
and is known to easily fall into local minima in which new items fail to be accurately inserted to
the current configuration. Lately, methods have unfolded LLMs double-edged capabilities in this
area [ 9,61] as they excel at generating sensible furniture descriptions while struggling in accurately
arranging them in the 3D space, which [ 12] addresses by introducing a costly refinement stage. In the
light of that, LLMs appear to be ideal candidates to supplement a specialized 3D layout generation
model.
Denoising Indoor Scenes Previous methods have explored diffusion-based approaches in the
context of 3D scene synthesis. Pioneering their usage, LEGO-Net [ 57] performs scene re-arrangement
(i.e., recovering a clean object layout from a noisy one) in the 2D space using a transformer backbone
that is not noise-conditioned, which we argue is the root cause of its main limitations. PhyScene[ 60]
augment diffusion-based 3D scene synthesis with additional physic-based guidance to enable practical
embodied agent applications. Most relevant to our work, DiffuScene [ 51] achieves 3D scene synthesis
by fitting a DDPM [ 16] on stacked 3D object features, resulting in a high-dimensional composite
distribution that is hard to learn and interpret. It does not enforce spatial configurations over other
predicted features. More importantly, its generative process is not conditioned on the room’s floor
plan (i.e., bounds) that constrains objects to be placed within a restricted area.
3 Method
3.1 3D Scene Representation
Our method is based on encoding the state of a 3D indoor scene Sthat is defined by a floor plan (i.e.,
bounds) Fand an unordered set of Nobjects O={o1, . . . , o N}, each being modeled by its typed
3D bounding box oi={xi,ci}where ci∈ {0,1}kis the one-hot encoding of the semantic category
among kclasses and xi= (pi,ri,di)∈R8comprises 3D spatial attributes. More specifically,
pi∈R3denotes the object’s center coordinate position, ri= (cos θi,sinθi)∈R2is a continuous
encoding of the rotation of angle θiaround the scene’s vertical axis [ 66] anddi∈R3is the dimension.

parameters (p,r,d)of indoor scene’s objects Oare perturbed with Gaussian noise σϵ. The floor
planF, noise level σand resulting objects Oσare processed by respective encoders to form an
unordered set of representations Tfed as input to a transformer encoder. Novel object embeddings
ˆToare finally decoded back to their predicted clean spatial configuration (ˆp,ˆr,ˆd). Trainable modules
are optimized by minimizing a semantic-aware Chamfer loss. Input object categories care randomly
dropped to model both the class-conditional and unconditional 3D layout distributions.
3.2 Diffusion Framework and Architecture
We describe in this section our score-based layout generation framework, relevant design choices and
network architecture, that are summarized in Figure 2. Remarkably, unlike previous approaches [ 51,
38,37] that output a range of attributes lying in different spaces, we focus on accurately modeling
3D spatial layouts of bounded indoor scenes from a set of input object categories.
Learning 3D spatial configurations from object semantics We adopt a diffusion-based approach
to yield a conditional generation model that outputs 3D object spatial features {xi}N
i=1from an
input floor plan and set of semantic categories y= (F,c)withc={ci}N
i=1. During training,
3D spatial attributes are perturbed with Gaussian noise ϵ∼ N (0,I)at various noise levels (i.e.,
magnitudes) σ. A trainable noise-conditioned denoiser model Dθ(xσ;y, σ)maps noisy spatial
attributes xσ=x+σϵto their clean counterparts ˆx≈x∈RN×8.
We notice that each object spatial attribute has an individual real-world interpretation (e.g, panddcan
be expressed in meters, rin degrees). To preserve their measurable nature at intermediate perturbed
configurations xσ, we want our diffusion parameterization to support a continuous range of noise
levels, correlated to the scale of the input signal. This will be particularly convenient at test time (see
Section 3.5). To guarantee both properties, we adapt the score-based EDM [ 19] framework. In our
context, this formulation is more natural than the DDPM framework employed by previous work [ 51].
The latter is based on discretizing noise levels and does not offer a straightforward interpretability of
the scene’s state at arbitrary timesteps. Our parameterization is further detailed in Appendix A.
Estimating the unconditional layout density Inspired by classifier-free guidance [17] in the
image domain, we model both the class-conditional density pθ 
x|F,c
and the unconditional density
pθ 
x|F,∅)by a single network of parameters θ. At each training iteration, we perform conditioning
dropout on the set of semantic categories, by setting c=∅with probability pdropelse{ci}N
i=1. We
found that this mechanism helps to reduce overfitting of the training layouts pdata(x)and enables
novel capabilities that we introduce in Section 3.4.
Denoiser Network Architecture Our lightweight architecture is inspired by previous work [ 57]
to which we make key changes. Similar to [ 38] and [ 51], we use a shared object encoder in order
to obtain per-object token Toias a concatenation of the object oiattributes embedded by sinusoidal
positional encoding and linear layers. Following [ 57], we uniformly sample Ppoints on the edges of
the floor plan and feed them into a PointNet [ 41] model, resulting in a floor token TF. This choice of
feature extractor backbone is natural as it allows to maintain all the input scene’s spatial features in a
4common 3D space. Importantly, a noise token Tσis computed from the current noise level σ, making
our architecture noise-aware , i.e., able to denoise layouts xσat any perturbation magnitude.
All the previously encoded tokens form a sequence T={TF,Tσ,Toi, . . . ,ToN}from which a global
scene encoder Tθcomputes rich representations ˆT. We design the method without any token ordering
and use padding mask for scene with fewer objects than the transformer capabilities. A final shared
decoder MLP takes as input object tokens {ˆToi}N
i=1and returns denoised spatial attribute values
ˆx={(ˆpi,ˆri,ˆdi)}N
i=1. We provide implementation details on the denoiser in Appendix B.1.
3.3 3D Spatial Objective
Our noise-conditioned model Dθis optimized towards a novel semantic-aware Chamfer Distance
objective that does not penalize permutation of 3D bounding boxes sharing the same semantic
category between the predicted scene objects layout ˆOand the ground truth one O:
LCD(ˆO,O) =1

where l(ˆo, o) =∥ˆx−x∥2

. (2)
Here, κis a large value so that a significant penalty is applied to objects that do not share the same
semantic category c, preventing them to be returned by the min operator.
We can finally rewrite the usual score-based training objective [49, 19] as:
Epdata(x),ϵ,σ
λ(σ)LCD(Dθ(x+σϵ;y, σ),x)
(3)
where λ(σ)is a noise-dependent loss weighting function.
3.4 Self Score Evaluation
While specifying complete conditioning information such as the set of object semantics ccould
be tedious, it can be provided by either a LLM or a separately trained sequence generation model.
However, using independent models is inherently suboptimal since it does not guarantee that the
generated conditioning input will be aligned with the score model knowledge. As a result, we propose
a novel method to select conditioning inputs that are attuned with the model’s capabilities.
More specifically, we evaluate a finite set of Cobject semantic categories candidates , where each
candidate is associated to a 3D spatial layout sampled from the learned conditional density, i.e.,

 (c) DeBaRA
Figure 3: We compare our method with established baselines for generating a 3D layout from a floor
plan and set of object categories. DeBaRA produces less failure cases while consistently generating
regular arrangements within the room’s bounds.
In practice, we compute an unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of each candidate expectation using
Tssefixed (σ,ϵ)pairs. Although similar in some aspects, SSE fundamentally differs from diffusion
classifiers [ 22] as in our case, the uniform assumption over conditioning probabilities does not hold.
Indeed, in our setting some input signals cannot lead to a plausible arrangement at all. As a result,
density estimates of observed samples generated by the class-conditioned model are computed using
the unconditional one, while diffusion classifiers compute density estimates of a single observed
sample using the class-conditioned model. The SSE procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1. It is further
illustrated and discussed in Appendix C.
3.5 Application Scenarios
As shown in Figure 1, a single trained DeBaRA model can be used at test time to perform multiple
downstream interactive applications. Usual generation procedures, such as EDM 2ndorder stochastic
sampler [ 19] can be applied using our trained denoiser to generate novel 3D layouts via T-step
iterative denoising at discretized noise levels σ0=σmax> . . . > σ T= 0.
In particular, several applications can be performed by inpainting [ 30], i.e., predicting missing spatial
features from those specified (i.e., fixed) in the input layout x∈RN×8. To do so, we introduce a
binary mask m∈ {0,1}N×8specifying values to retain from the input. The predicted layout at any
sampling iteration tcan be expressed as:
˜xσt=ˆxσt⊙(1−m) +xσt⊙m (6)
3D Layout Generation Novel and diverse 3D layouts can be generated from an input set of
semantic categories cand a floor plan Fby sampling from a high initial noise level σmax>> σ data,
arbitrarily initialized 3D spatial features xσ0and with m=0N×8.
3D Scene Synthesis DeBaRA can perform 3D scene synthesis via 3D layout generation from
semantic categories provided by external sources such as a LLM [ 9]. Input conditioning candidates
can further be optimally selected using the Self Score Evaluation procedure.
Scene Completion Additional objects oacan be inserted to an existing scene partially furnished
withkobjects oe. To do so, their 3D spatial attributes xaare inpainted from the existing ones xe
withDθconditioned on the updated set of semantic categories c=ce∥causingm(i, j) =1{i≤k}.
Re-arrangement In the context of scene synthesis, re-arrangement [ 57] consists in recovering
the closest clean spatial configuration of existing objects from a messy one, which has practical
applications in robotics [ 2]. DeBaRA can perform re-arrangement by sampling from an initial noise
σmaxthat depends on the scene perturbation magnitude. During denoising, object positions and
rotations (p,r)∈RN×5are inpainted from the known object dimensions using m(i, j) =1{j>5}.

 (e) Completed
Figure 4: Qualitative results on scene re-arrangement (left) and completion (right). DeBaRA is able
to recover a plausible layout from a messy one, and to finely take into account initial configurations.
Optimal Object Retrieval 3D scene synthesis systems depend on external 3D asset databases for
furnishing rooms. For each object of semantic class c, a textured furniture is retrieved by minimizing
the mismatch with the generated dimension dσT. This is inherently suboptimal as the resulting
scene quality is limited by the size of the external database. To overcome this issue, we introduce a
post-retrieval refinement stage by performing additional re-arrangement steps starting from a noise
levelσmaxderived from the mismatch between generated and retrieved object dimensions.
Generation from Coarse Specifications We propose a time-dependent masking approach to
synthesize layouts from rough input spatial features (i.e., instead of exact ones), that are adjusted in
the late denoising iterations. To indicate approximate e.g., object dimensions, we set, at any sampling
stept,m(i, j) =1{j>5andt<Ts}. The denoising step Tsfrom which misrelaxed (i.e., set to 0) can
be derived from its corresponding noise level σTsand the precision of specified input features.
4 Experiments
In this section, we provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of DeBaRA that we compare
with established baselines from different model families. We also demonstrate the capabilities of our
approach in various practical scenarios, enabling a wide range of applications.
Datasets Our experiments are conducted on the 3D-FRONT [ 10] synthetic indoor layouts, furnished
with assets from 3D-FUTURE [ 11] that we use as the object retrieval database. Out of the available
room types in the dataset, we independently consider living rooms and dining rooms which are more
densely furnished and feature complex floor plans. We follow the preprocessing from ATISS [ 38],
leading respectively to 2338 /587and2071 /516train/test splits.
Baselines We compare DeBaRA with ATISS [ 38] autoregressive transformer and DiffuScene [ 51]
denoising network. To ensure a fair comparison with our method, we retrained both models with
floor plan conditioning on each 3D-FRONT subset using their official implementations. To perform
3D arrangement generation with DiffuScene, we implemented DDPM inpainting [ 30] of object
spatial features from their known semantic categories. Additionally, we report experimental results
obtained by LayoutGPT [ 9] that we implemented with a Llama-3-8B backbone [ 8] that we also
use to provide semantic categories in scene synthesis scenarios. Following the paper, we perform
prompting with supporting examples : for each test scene, we retrieve top- ksamples from the training
set that have the most similar floor plan and include their spatial configuration as few-shot exemplars.
Note that LayoutGPT adopts a training-free approach and is therefore not directly comparable to our
method. However, we show how it can be used alongside a specialized model such as DeBaRA. Full
implementation details and LLM prompting strategies are reported in Appendix B.3.
Evaluation Metrics We follow previous work [ 43,38,51,9,55] and evaluate the realism and
diversity of generated arrangements by reporting the 2562Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [ 15],
Kernel Inception Distance (KID ×1,000) [3] and Scene Classification Accuracy (SCA, values closer
to50% are better) computed on top-down orthographic renderings. Resulting projections feature
the scene’s floor plan and objects colored according to their semantic class [ 51]. The generation
spatial validity is further assessed by reporting the cumulated out of bounds objects area (OBA, in
m2). Related indicators are provided and discussed in Appendix D.1. Metrics are computed across
each test subset, for which we generate the same number of scenes as the number of realones.
74.1 3D Layout Generation
The primary task of DeBaRA is to generate diverse and valid 3D layouts within a given floor plan and
a list of object semantics. We showcase qualitative generation results and comparisons in Figure 3. As
highlighted by previous work [ 57,51], denoising-based methods better capture the interplay between
interacting objects. We also observe that DeBaRA largely outperforms baselines at respecting the
scene’s bounds while consistently producing more natural arrangements. These observations are
quantitatively verified in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 3.
Table 1: Quantitative experiment results on bounded 3D layout generation (providing a floor plan
and a list of object semantic categories). We compare our method against other learning-based
approaches and additionally indicate results obtained from a training-free LayoutGPT.

4.2 3D Scene Synthesis and Self Score Evaluation
We demonstrate competitive or state-of-the-art capabilities on 3D scene synthesis against methods
that have been specifically trained for this task. We consider several settings depending on the
source of input object categories and report our results in Table 2. First, we observe that randomly
picking input semantics from the training set ( Dataset Random ) or taking the set cgenerated by
LayoutGPT [9] outperform baselines by a significant margin on the 3D-FRONT living rooms test set.
Then, to measure the individual impact of SSE, we compare a setup in which input semantics are
selected from a set of LLM-generated ones, either randomly ( LLM ) or by applying SSE. As LLMs
often hallucinate or produce out-of-distribution sets, our procedure consistently improves realism and
validity of the synthesized indoor scenes, which can also be qualitatively observed in Figure 5. These
results further validate our choice to focus solely on 3D spatial features of objects.
Table 2: Quantitative experiment results on 3D scene synthesis . DeBaRA is evaluated in various
settings based on the source of object semantic categories c. Precise settings are detailed and
discussed in Appendix B.4. DeBaRA outperforms established baselines on most evaluation metrics.

We present DeBaRA’s capabilities at performing additional controllable tasks. Notably, we include
quantitative (Table 3) and qualitative (Figure 7) experimental evaluations against LEGO-Net [ 57] on
scene-rearrangement. Results highlight that our method is able to recover more realistic arrangements,
while being closer to their initial, messy configurations. This is remarkable as the LEGO-Net baseline
has been specifically trained to perform this task.

We also provide additional re-arrangement results and showcase DeBaRA’s scene completion capa-
bilities, by inserting objects from a list of additional semantics, in Figure 4.
4.4 Ablations
We evaluate the individual contributions of some of our framework’s key components on the base
3D layout generation task. Notably, results reported in Table 4 highlight the advantage of our novel
objective (Section 3.3) over common formulations as well as the benefits of modeling both the
unconditional and class-conditional densities of 3D layouts during training (Section 3.2).
Table 4: Ablation study on DeBaRA training setup . We evaluate the individual impact, on 3D
layout generation, of different learning objectives Land of applying conditioning dropout with rate
pdrop. Notably, the use of our novel Chamfer distance results in a significant performance increase.

4.5 Additional Results
Complex Floor Plans We notice that the 3D-FRONT dataset mostly contains simple floor maps
(i.e., single room, squared, rectangular) both for training and evaluation. As a result, we manually
designed irregular floor shapes and report DeBaRA’s generation in Figure 8, which further highlights
the robustness of our method and its consideration for the conditioning input.

Figure 8: Generated layouts from a given set of objects and complex floor plans , selected from
the 3D-FRONT test set or handcrafted to irregular, out-of-distribution shapes. While challenging,
DeBaRA is able to output plausible layouts in which objects are scattered across the input floor plans.
9Iterative Sampling We provide a visualization of the iterative denoising process over time when
generating a 3D layout from arbitrarily initialized object bounding boxes in Figure 9.

Generation Variety and Validity We also perform scene completion by adding a bookshelf and a
coffee table, repeat the experiment ten times and report in Figure 10 the denoising object trajectories,
intermediate and final positions (colored and black dots respectively). This allows to observe the
variety of predicted layouts. Notably, we can see that the bookshelf ends up in various different
positions, always next to a wall, while the coffee table, which is functionally constrained by its
surrounding objects, is placed at similar valid locations.

tories and final positions of a pair of objects,

Network Efficiency Finally, we compare the number of parameters as well as the sampling (i.e.,
generation) time, measured on the 3D layout generation task, of our DeBaRA backbone with those
of other recent data-driven approaches in Table 5. We can see that our lightweight architecture is
bridging the gap with autoregressive methods in terms of inference efficiency.
5 Conclusion, Limitations and Future Work
In this paper we proposed DeBaRA, a novel score-based framework, which achieves state-of-the-
art results in 3D layout generation. Our approach is distinctive in its design choices, which both
favor data-efficiency with enhanced spatial reasoning, while, at the same time, enabling a range of
applications such as scene re-arrangement and completion. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Self
Score Evaluation procedure, which allows us to leverage a trained model to select the conditioning
signals, which lead to the most plausible results. Overall, our work is the first to unify the conditioning
and prediction spaces of score-based models within the context of 3D generative layout.
While powerful, our method currently does not enforce physical constraints between interacting
objects, which can lead to collisions. We also assume that object semantic classes are selected among
a finite set of predefined categories. Finally, we do not enforce style consistency between objects,
which can, nevertheless, be performed at retrieval time.
We believe that our approach can enhance other generative models (e.g., architectural layouts, images)
by both evaluating the quality and by promoting more plausible 3D layout designs. Furthermore,
it will be interesting to combine our approach with encoders from other modalities for a unified
multi-modal layout generation.

14Appendix
A Score-based Framework
In this section, we give additional details on the score-based parameterization that we adopt to learn
the distribution of 3D layouts pdata(x)and the sampling strategy used to generate new samples from
the resulting trained denoiser Dθ.
A.1 Training
Score-based approaches model the score (i.e., the gradient of log-probability density w.r.t. the data)
of marginal distributions pσ(x)obtained by perturbing the data with Gaussian noise ϵ∼ N(0,I)at
magnitudes σ. In practice, the score can be effectively approximated by a noise-conditioned denoiser
that outputs clean samples from noisy ones, then, ∇xlogpσ(x) = (Dθ(x;y, σ)−x)/σ2.
Parameterizing the denoiser to output xfrom its corrupted version directly is not ideal as the input
magnitude varies greatly depending on the current noise level. Instead, Karras et al. [19] propose in
their EDM diffusion framework a preconditioning of the denoiser whose output is now derived from
a trainable network Fθthat either predicts the clean signal x, the noise ϵor something in between,
depending on the value of σ. More formally, it can be expressed as:
Dθ(x;y, σ) =cskip(σ)x+cout(σ)Fθ 
cin(σ)x;y, cnoise(σ)
(7)
The preconditioning function cskipamplifies the network error as little as possible while cinandcout
scale respectively the input and output to have unit variance. Following [19], we set:
cskip=σ2
data
σ2data+σ2;cin=1p
σ2data+σ2;cout=σ·σdatap
σ2data+σ2;cnoise=ln(σ)
4(8)
Note that in our case, the value of σdatashould preferably be computed channel-wise for each
attribute of x= (p,r,d)∈R8, as object positions, rotations and dimensions typically have different
standard deviations. In practice, we compute σp
dataandσd
datafrom the training data and arbitrarily set
σr
data= (0.5,0.5). During training, noise values σare drawn from a centered normal distribution
of variance 0.25, which concentrates training on medium noise levels. Spatial values panddof
each training layout xare normalized based on the maximum extent of the scene’s floor plan F,
which ensures that all the network’s inputs and outputs are scaled in [−1,1]. To model both the
class-conditional and unconditional layout densities, we perform conditioning dropout on object
categories cwith a rate pdrop= 0.2.
Finally, the training objective can be expressed by introducing our semantic-aware Chamfer recon-
struction loss following Equation 3. As in EDM, we use λ(σ) = 1 /c2
outto get a uniform weighting
across noise levels.
A.2 Sampling
At test time, the reverse SDE [ 19,49] associated to the continuous-time diffusion process is used to
generate novel samples from a standard normal distribution using numerical solvers. It depends on
the score approximated during training:
dx=
f(x, t)−g(t)2∇xlogpt(x)
dt+g(t)dw (9)
where f(·, t) :Rd→Rdandg(·) :R→Rare respectively the drift and diffusion coefficients and w
is the standard stochastic Wiener process.
In practice, we use EDM [ 19] 2ndorder Runge-Kutta stochastic sampler (see Algorithm 2), that
resembles the predictor/corrector framework from Song et al. [ 49] and provides a good trade-off
between generation quality and number of function evaluations (NFE).
It is based on a T-step discretization of the reverse SDE [ 19,49], with timesteps ti∈{0,...,T−1}
decreasing from σmax(i= 0) toσmin(i=T−1). Following [19], we use:
ti<T=
σmax1

Note that tand noise level σcan be used interchangeably. The ρparameter is tuned to dedicate
more steps of the denoising process to smaller or larger noise levels. The σminvalue should be small
enough so that the model estimates the best approximation of the score and sample a precise layout.
On the other hand, σmaxshould be large enough to sample various layouts. The amount of fresh noise
injected at the beginning of each denoising step is defined by γi∈{0,...,N−1}. Similar to Wei et al. [ 57]
and Karras et al. [ 19], we qualitatively observed that adding noise in the final timesteps, i.e., when
the layout is close to its final configuration, leads to less precise results. As a result, an additional
Sminparameter is set so that γi= 0when ti< S min.
For 3D layout generation, we use T= 50 timesteps and set σmax= 1.0,σmin= 0.005,ρ= 7, and
Smin= 0.005. Note that, although we perform conditioning dropout during training, we didn’t find
the need to amplify the strength of the input categories using any classifier-free guidance [ 17] scale at
sampling time.
Additionally, Table 6 shows that sampling from DeBaRA using EDM [ 19] 2ndorder stochastic
procedure (Algorithm 2) outperforms ancestral DDPM [ 16] sampling using a fraction of the denoising
steps. This, combined with our lightweight architecture, enables real-time (<1s) generation.

generation task.

B Implementation
We provide in this section additional implementation details on our model architecture and training
configurations, illustrated in Figure 2. We also detail how baselines have been retrained and used at
test time to ensure a fair and relevant comparison with our approach.
B.1 Network Architecture
Shared Object Encoder The shared object encoder embeds each object oifrom its input 3D spatial
values xiand semantic category ci. Triplets of scalar values of the object’s position piand dimension
diare encoded with fixed sinusoidal positional encoding of 32frequencies following [57]:
PE(s) =
sin(128j/31s),cos(128j/31s)	31
j=0∈R64(11)
Applying this module projects piandriinR192. It is similarly applied to ri= (cos( θi),sin(θi))to
get a feature in R128, that is additionally fed to a linear layer to obtain a 192-dimensional attribute.
16The object semantic class ci, represented as a one-hot vector among kclasses is encoded in R192by
an MLP with 2a hidden layer of 128 units and LeakyReLU activation. Respective object spatial and
semantic encodings are then concatenated to form an object token Toiof dimension 4×192 = 768 .
Floor Encoder The scene’s conditioning floor plan Fis embedded by a PointNet [ 41] module,
similar to [ 57]. To do so, we first extract the floor’s 2D polygon using the output of ATISS [ 38]
preprocessing and sample P= 100 evenly spaced points on its contour. The PointNet backbone2
produces a 1024 -dimensional feature, that is further passed to a linear layer to get the appropriate
floor token TF∈R768.
Noise Level Encoder We encode the noise level σas a token Tσ∈R768obtained by subsequently
applying PE(σ)and a linear layer with LeakyReLU activation.
Transformer Encoder Our transformer encoder that computes new representations ˆTis composed
of multi-head self-attention and feedforward layers, following the original paper [ 53] and implemen-
tation from the PyTorch [ 39] API. Importantly, we don’t enforce ordering of any input token and pass
an additional padding mask to handle sequences of different lengths. We stack 3encoder layers, each
having 4attention heads and a feedforward hidden dimension of 512.
Shared Object Decoder The final shared object decoder produces the network’s predicted spatial
values ˆxi∈R8for each of the Nobjects from their respective ˆToiembeddings. It is implemented as
an MLP with three layers of 512,128, and 8units, using LeakyReLU activations and a dropout rate
of0.1.
B.2 Training Protocol
During training, the network is optimized towards our semantic-aware Chamfer loss, that can be
efficiently implemented with appropriate broadcasting. We trained our models separately on the
3D-FRONT [ 10]living room anddining room subsets for 3000 epochs, with a batch size of 32and
monitor the validation loss to avoid overfitting of the training set in the late iterations. We use the
AdamW [ 29] optimizer with its PyTorch default parameters and learning rate η= 10−4, scheduled
with a linear warmup phase for the first 50epochs, starting at η×0.01. Following this, a cosine
annealing schedule [ 28] reduces ηto a minimum of 10−8over2200 epochs. Finally, we randomly
apply rotations to the training scenes as data augmentation.
B.3 Baselines
ATISS ATISS [ 38] is an autoregressive, permutation-invariant transformer that treats 3D scene
synthesis as an unordered set generation task. The model is natively conditioned on the room’s floor
plan, from which it extracts features using a ResNet-18 [ 14] applied on a top-down binary projection.
The model predicts the semantic class, location, rotation and dimension of the next object to be
inserted to the current layout configuration. As our method, it also supports inserting objects from
their semantic categories given as input, which is the setting that we used to report experimental
results on the 3D layout generation task (see Table 1 and Figure 3). We retrained the model on each
3D-FRONT subset using the authors’ implementation.3
DiffuScene DiffuScene [ 51] employs a DDPM to perform 3D scene synthesis, by learning to
denoise unordered sets of objects that are each represented by all their attributes, i.e., location, size,
orientation, semantic category and shape code . Although the paper specifically mentions not being
conditioned on the room’s bounds, we found out the official implementation supports this feature
that we enabled to retrain the model on the 3D-FRONT subsets, with other settings set to those of
the authors. In practice and similar to ATISS [38], a ResNet-18 backbone is used to extract features
from the floor plan’s projection mask. The resulting encoding is passed to an MLP whose output is
added to the diffusion timestep embedding, as in [ 46]. To assess the effectiveness of this conditioning
mechanism and validate the relevance of this baseline, we report metrics obtained for the 3D layout

17generation task, using both a floor-conditioned and an unconditional ( vanilla ) trained DiffuScene
model on the living room subset in Table 7. Note that, top-down view of scenes, that we use to
evaluate e.g., FID and KID scores, feature the floor plan, which penalizes generated configurations
that don’t properly take it into account.
Table 7: Quantitative impact of DiffuScene [ 51] floor plan conditioning on 3D layout generation.
Results indicate that the additional input has successfully been learned, resulting in a solid baseline.

DiffuScene floor 21.54 6.40 341.1
To perform 3D layout generation from input semantic categories using DiffuScene (Table 1, Figure 3),
we implemented DDPM inpainting of the object spatial features from their categories as an additional
method within the official implementation4and using default sampling settings with 1000 timesteps.
LayoutGPT LayoutGPT [ 9] is a training-free approach that utilizes Large Language Models to
generate layouts both in the image and the 3D scene domains, demonstrating competitive performance
with learning-based approaches on 3D scene synthesis. To do so, the method consists in prompting
a LLM with specific instructions and by adding supporting examples from the training set, i.e.,
few-shot exemplars of expected, valid layouts. These examples are retrieved from the train set based
on floor plan similarity computed from the binary masks with a test sample. We reimplemented
LayoutGPT, using the official implementation5for exact prompt and supporting examples retrieval,
but using a Meta Llama-3-8B6backbone instead of ChatGPT variants for local execution and better
reproducibility.
To perform 3D layout generation, we include in the prompt the list of object semantic categories.
Here is a typical LayoutGPT prompt for this task on the living room subset:
Instruction: synthesize the 3D layout of an indoor scene. The generated 3D layout should follow the CSS style, where each line starts with the furniture category and is followed by the 3D size, orientation and absolute position. Formally, each line should follow the template:  FURNITURE {length: ?m: width: ?m; height: ?m; left: ?m; top: ?m; depth: ?m; orientation: ? degrees;} All values are in meters but the orientation angle is in degrees.  Condition: Room Type: livingroom Room Size: max length 1.00m, max width 1.53m Furniture categories: console_table multi_seat_sofa corner_side_table corner_side_table coffee_table tv_stand pendant_lamp Layout: console_table {length: 0.28m; height: 0.31m; width: 0.14m; orientation: -90 degrees; left: 0.93m; top: 0.41m; depth: 0.15m;} […]  [OTHER SUPPORTING EXAMPLES]  Condition: Room Type: livingroom Room Size: max length 1.00m, max width 1.62m Furniture categories: tv_stand corner_side_table coffee_table dining_table dining_chair dining_chair dining_chair dining_chair armchair pendant_lamp pendant_lamp multi_seat_sofa Layout: 
For 3D scene synthesis, we follow the paper and include the training set’s object frequencies in the
prompt. We set the LLM sampling temperature to 0.7and maximum output tokens to 1024 . We

report LayoutGPT performance on this task in Table 2, where we also indicate metrics obtained by
DeBaRA when using as conditioning input the same semantic set as the one generated by LayoutGPT
for the corresponding test scene. In this setup, we largely outperform the baseline and even report
state-of-the-art FID, KID and OBA scores on 3D-FRONT living room .
LEGO-Net The LEGO-Net [ 57] model is specifically designed to perform 2D scene re-arrangement,
i.e., recover a close clean layout configuration from a messy , perturbed one. It is trained using a
regression loss on object position and rotation values, and proposes a Langevin dynamics-like
iterative sampling procedure. In order to produce the results reported in Table 3, we used authors’
implementation,7in the grad without noise setting (which is the best performing in the original paper),
on the 3D-FRONT living room test subset and with a scene perturbation level of 0.25.
B.4 LLM Prompting
As mentioned in the main submission, we perform 3D scene synthesis using DeBaRA conditioned on
LLM-generated sets of object semantics, that we optionally select via Self Score Evaluation (Table 2,
Figure 5). In practice, the generated categories have been obtained using Llama-3-8B [ 8] following
the LayoutGPT [ 9] prompting strategy. We experienced asking the language model to generate solely
lists of object semantics using a few supporting examples and providing the dataset statistics, but we
noticed that it was more prone to hallucinate and drift towards inconsistent generations than when
generating complete layout configurations (i.e., including object position and orientation values).
The DeBaRA LLM reported in Table 2 corresponds to the setup where we filter from the LLM-
generated sets of categories those having the same number of objects as the considered test scene and
randomly select one to condition DeBaRA. The DeBaRA LLM + SSE setting is similar, but instead of
picking a set randomly, the selection is performed by applying the SSE procedure.
B.5 Computational Requirements
All the training and evaluation experiments as well as the computation of generation times reported in
Table 5 have been performed on a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. When comparing our number
of network parameters and generation times with those of ATISS [ 38] and DiffuScene [ 51], we notice
that DeBaRA is bridging the gap with autoregressive methods in terms of inference efficiency. This
is made possible by our restricted output space that requires a more lightweight backbone as well as
our choice of sampling procedure that leads to a favorable NFE / generation quality tradeoff.

19C Self Score Evaluation
In this section, we provide additional content regarding our SSE procedure (Section 3.4), by illustrat-
ing it and by further assessing its expressive power.
C.1 Pipeline
The SSE formulation is expressed by Equations 4 - 5. It follows the procedure outlined in Algorithm 1.
We additionally illustrate the SSE pipeline in Figure 11. In our experiments, SSE is implemented
using Tsse= 100 trials, with noise levels σdrawn as in training.
C.2 Additional Evaluation
We additionally evaluate the expressive power of the SSE procedure in a toybinary classification task:
for each scene of the test set, we create a corrupted version by replacing a proportion prandof the
scene’s object categories by random ones. We report the binary classification score obtained by SSE
when asked to discriminate the corrupted set of semantics from the ground truth one. We perform the
experiments 10times to account for the inherent stochasticity of the experimental setup and report
the results for several values of prandin Table 8.
Table 8: SSE performance at discriminating ground truth sets of categories from perturbed ones.
Perturbation None Single prand= 0.35 prand= 0.50 prand= 0.75 All
Accuracy (%) 50.6±4.39 71 .7±2.20 73 .8±3.38 78 .5±1.84 80 .9±2.62 84 .0±2.90
We observe a significant gap in accuracy between the control experiment (none object is perturbed,
meaning that the sets are equals) and the setting where only a single object has been swapped. It
means that SSE is able to identify subtle misalignments between the network’s knowledge and the
provided conditioning candidates.
D Additional Results
In this section, we provide supplementary quantitative indicators measuring the validity of generated
layouts with respect to the conditioning floor plan. We also showcase additional qualitative results
and comparisons in multiple application scenarios.
D.1 Bounding Metrics
In addition to the cumulated out of bounds objects area (OBA, in m2) reported in Table 1, we indicate
the rate of scenes having at least one object out of its bounds (OBR), and the cumulated number of
out-of-bounds objects in the generated layouts (OBN) in Table 9. For OBR and OBN, we consider an
object to be out-of-bounds if at least 20% of its 2D bounding box surface is outside the floor’s limits.
Table 9: Quantitative bounding metrics on the 3D layout generation task. We observe that DeBaRA
is consistently better at respecting the indoor floor plan by a significant margin.

natural layouts for the considered floor configuration.

D.3 Statistical Analysis
We can observe in our qualitative results, e.g., in Figure 3, that objects are most of the time parallel or
perpendicular to walls, meaning that their rotation attributes rmainly take cardinal angle values, i.e.,
0°,90°,180° or270°.
Radial histograms of object rotation values reported in Figure 16 indicate that 3D-FRONT [ 10]
subsets contain rooms in which objects, in their vast majority, exhibit this property and don’t have
much exotic angles, i.e., different from cardinal ones. These restricted rotation distributions are
consequently learned and reflected in the outputs of generative models at sampling time.

our method, reported for both test subsets. We can see that the original data predominantly features
objects rotated by 0°,90°,180°or270°around the scene’s vertical axis, which, as a result, is also the
tendency induced by the generative model.
E Societal Impact
We believe that our method will predominantly yield positive societal impact by enhancing accessi-
bility, controllability and efficiency in 3D indoor design and creation, benefiting both non-experts and
professionals in several industries.
Nevertheless, it raises common concerns associated with deep generative models. Specifically, users
should be warned about using the model for furnishing real-world rooms as generated layouts may
result in unsafe designs. Additionally, privacy safeguards should systematically be implemented
along our method in order to prevent unauthorized replication of personal spaces.

24NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Claims made in the abstract are all developed throughout the paper, notably in
themethod Section 3.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the paper’s main limitations in the last Section 5, along with the
conclusion.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
25Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For our main theoretical contribution, Self Score Evaluation (Section 3.4), we
clearly state that it is made possible under the assumption that the denoiser models both the
unconditional and the class-conditional data distributions.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We comprehensively detail our experimental setup, both for our method and
the baselines in the main paper, Section 4, and in Appendix A and B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
265.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Unfortunately, the code for DeBaRA cannot be disclosed due to author
affiliation. However, we comprehensively describe our settings and implementation details
in Appendix A and B and the 3D-FRONT [10] dataset is openly available.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the relevant details are given in the paper, notably in Section 4, as well as
in Appendix B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Unfortunately, we couldn’t perform such analysis due to limited computational
resources.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
27•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We indicate our GPU setting in Appendix B.5 and report network execution
time in the main submission (Table 5).
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Potential societal impacts, both positive or negative, are discussed in a dedi-
cated section in Appendix E. We also discuss possible ways to mitigate potential negative
societal impacts.
28Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Creators or owners of assets are either credited via citation of their work
(e.g., 3D-FRONT [ 10] and 3D-FUTURE [ 11] datasets) or direct link to their code or model
(throughout Appendix B). A dedicated section in Appendix F explicitly mentions the relevant
licenses, which have been properly respected to conduct our work.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
29•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
30•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
