Abstract
Physical Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) plays a crucial role in numerous applica-
tions. However, existing HSI techniques are limited to specific object dynamics and
privileged information, which prevents the development of more comprehensive
applications. To address this limitation, we introduce HumanVLA for general
object rearrangement directed by practical vision and language. A teacher-student
framework is utilized to develop HumanVLA. A state-based teacher policy is
trained first using goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and adversarial mo-
tion prior. Then, it is distilled into a vision-language-action model via behavior
cloning. We propose several key insights to facilitate the large -scale learning pro-
cess. To support general object rearrangement by physical humanoid, we introduce
a novel Human-in-the-Room dataset encompassing various rearrangement tasks.
Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.
1 Introduction
Learning human-scene interaction (HSI) in realistic physical environments is a vital requirement
of many applications, including computer graphics, embodied AI, and robotics. In this field, many

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).previous efforts have been made to promote expressive humanoid control [ 36,46,27,56], static
physical scene interaction [ 43,15,50,33], and manipulating a specific object [ 47,15,51]. These
works have achieved great success in synthesizing plausible HSI controls.
Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in the realm of more extensive HSI applications and two
primary issues need to be solved. Firstly , the current techniques are limited to static objects, such as
sitting on a chair [ 50,33], or specific object dynamics, such as carrying a box [ 15] and throwing a
ball [ 47]. However, in a more complicated real-world environment, humans demonstrate exceptional
skills in manipulating a diverse range of objects with different geometries, poses, and weights. It
poses a challenging requirement on the varied dynamics of objects in HSI synthesis, i.e., a universal
manipulation policy. Secondly , ground-truth object and goal states are necessary to direct humanoid
controls in previous works. However, without the help of external localization devices, this privileged
information is difficult to access in a real-world transfer. It prohibits practical real-world extensions
like humanoid robots and necessitates an easily deployable perception method.
Our work takes a step forward in the above two challenges. We investigate the concept of general-
purpose object rearrangement performed by a physically interactive humanoid. The whole-body
physical humanoid is instructed to carry out daily object loco-manipulations in an indoor room
setting. The tasks involve human-like motion controls, interaction with diverse objects, and following
desired object dynamics. Moreover, considering the unavailability of privileged information about
object and goal states in real-world humanoid applications, we delve into humanoid controls directed
by practical vision and language. Compared to privileged states, vision-language modalities are
more accessible and offer new potential for practical applications. It also presents an ultimate vision
of the research community on humanoids: a human-like agent capable of understanding language
instructions, perceiving its environment, and executing daily tasks to assist humans. Fig. 1 provides
intuitive examples of our work, where the humanoid agent can push a table, carry a laptop, and pull
a chair, all directed by vision and language. Comparisons of our work with previous studies are
available in Tab. 1.
Our work starts with learning state-based teacher policy and then distills the policy into a vision-
language-action model. In the first stage, we train the policy using goal-conditioned reinforcement
learning and adversarial motion priors (AMP) [ 36], within a generative adversarial imitation learn-
ing [16] paradigm. The discrimination reward plus task-conditioned reward encourages humanoids to
generate realistic motions and complete the task. However, interacting with diverse objects remains
challenging for vanilla AMP. We introduce improved techniques to facilitate general manipulation,
in-context navigation, and prioritized task completion. In the second stage, we distill the policy into
a student network, named HumanVLA , an end-to-end vision-language-action model for physical
humanoid. Behavior cloning [ 2] is used to train the student HumanVLA, i.e., cloning the teacher
action at each step. A challenge of learning VLA models is the poor perception quality of the
unconstrained camera pose. We propose a novel active rendering technique to improve gaze intention.
To support HumanVLA, we create a novel dataset named Human-in-the-Room (HITR) . It consists of
four different room layouts: bedroom ,livingroom ,kitchen , and warehouse . Each layout is populated
with separated ,instantiable , and replaceable objects from HSSD [ 22] assets to create diverse scenes.
The humanoid agent is placed in the scene with an instruction to rearrange the room. Statistically, the
HITR dataset consists of 50 static objects and 34 movable objects. In our extensive experiments, we
train HumanVLA in IsaacGym [ 28] with tasks from HITR. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method in generalized object rearrangement and vision-language perception.
In summary, our contributions include: (1) We study general object rearrangement by physical
humanoids. Several advanced techniques are introduced to interact with diverse objects. (2) We
propose HumanVLA, the first vision-language-action model on physical humanoids to complete
tasks directed by egocentric vision and natural language instruction. (3) We propose the HITR dataset
to facilitate research in this field. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in HITR to validate the
effectiveness of our method.

Motion Synthesis is a long-term research topic in graphics, vision, and robotics. It can be divided
into two streams: kinematic motion synthesis [ 43,42,17,14,24,18,5,20,54,19,25,1,7] and
physics-based motion synthesis [ 34,36,35,21,50,27,46,56,41,51,33,47,6,26]. Kinematic

methods aim at synthesizing visually plausible motions with less penetration, floating, and being
semantically faithful. It leverages generative neural networks like V AEs [ 14,7], Transformers [ 1,19],
or Diffusions [ 24,18,20] to predict next state. Our work belongs to the physics-based methods, which
have an additional requirement on physical plausibility. It follows a control-then-model paradigm
where the control is typically achieved by a learning algorithm, and the model is constrained by
a physics simulator. DeepMimic [ 34] uses reinforcement learning plus imitation learning to track
motion references and perform versatile motion controls. NCP [ 56] advances motion tracking with
discrete latent prior. Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) [ 36] uses generative adversarial imitation
learning to learn natural state transition from unstructured motion data. It is further extended with a
reusable controller [ 35], high-level language [ 21], expressive control [ 27], and latent conditions [ 46].
Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on the synthesis of interactive motions. InterPhys [ 15]
uses task-conditioned reward plus stylized adversarial reward to perform HSI tasks such as sitting,
lying, and box carrying. InterScene [ 33] extends the paradigm to synthesize long-horizon static
interactions. UniHSI [ 50] leverages the vast knowledge of the language model to provide a unified
interface for static HSI. However, previous works are limited to static objects or specific movable
objects but fail to interact with various objects. In contrast, our research studies general object
rearrangement in a daily room, posed with challenges in diverse object geometries, positions, and
weights.
Room Rearrangement is a crucial application of embodied AI, where an instructed agent is placed
in a room to search, navigate, and interact with desired objects. Recent efforts [ 48,44,53,23,9] have
proposed various platforms and benchmarks to facilitate room rearrangement research. Visual room
rearrangement [48] takes the agent to transverse both goal and initial scenes to recover object states
based on visual observations. OVMM [ 53] presents open-vocabulary pick-and-place manipulation
challenges in pursuit of extreme generalization capability. Recent algorithms [ 49,11] leverage
commonsense knowledge in large language models to plan rearrangements. However, these works
are designed for simple embodiments, such as disc-shaped mobility and gripper manipulation. They
are limited to moving on smooth terrain and handling only small-sized objects. In contrast, our work
pioneers the design of rearrangement tasks in a complex human-like embodiment. It benefits from
bipedal locomotion and stronger interaction motors. For example, our model is capable of carrying
20kgobjects, which is beyond the capabilities of traditional stretches.
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Model maps practical vision-language input to generate action
controls. It has demonstrated impressive results in the fields of embodied AI and robotics [ 12,57,
32,3,55]. Thanks to the robust scalability of the vision and language modalities, VLAs also benefit
from large-scale training [ 57,32], opening up the potential for more general-purpose applications.
However, existing VLAs are designed for simple embodiments, such as desktop gripper manipulation.
The exploration of VLAs for more complex, high-dimensional humanoids is still in its early stages.
Our work is the first to develop humanoid controls directed by practical vision and language.
3 Approach
In this section, we introduce the learning process of HumanVLA. Training HumanVLA directly
through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges, including a high-
dimensional action space, a composite state space, slow rendering speed, and other common issues
associated with large-scale RL. To this end, we utilize a teacher-student framework to train Human-
VLA, which has been validated in applications like dexterous re-oreintation [ 8] and grasping [ 52].

reinforcement learning and adversarial motion prior.
It consists of two phases. In the first phase (Sec. 3.1), we leverage goal-conditioned reinforcement
learning and adversarial motion priors [ 36] to train HumanVLA-Teacher. It is presented with the
oracle scene state, including precise object pose, geometry, navigation waypoint, and goal coordinate.
In the second phase (Sec. 3.2), we operate in a more practical setting, where the egocentric vision is
tasked with perceiving the scene, and natural language instruction is used to specify the goal. In a
blueprint of real-world humanoid robots, observations used by HumanVLA are all accessible in a
real-world deployment. HumanVLA is trained via behavior cloning [ 2] from HumanVLA-Teacher,
where the pre-trained teacher policy significantly reduces the compute demands of the process.
3.1 State-based Teacher Policy Learning
We train HumanVLA-Teacher with complete knowledge of the scene state to enable a variety of
object rearrangement tasks. The rearrangement task is formulated as a reinforcement learning process.
To elaborate, at each time step t, given state stand goal g, HumanVLA-Teacher πtchpredicts an
action atfrom policy distribution πtch(at|st, g). The action atis processed by a physics simulator
f(st+1|at, st)to generate the next state st+1. The learning objective is to maximize the accumulated
reward R(πtch) =PT−1
t=0γtrtwhere γis the discount factor and rtis the step reward at time t.
To train robust policies that enable humanoids to interact with objects and achieve various goals gin a
life-like manner, it is crucial for the humanoids to learn from authentic human motions and generalize
across different tasks. To this end, we use goal-conditioned task reward rG(g, st, st+1)to encourage
the agent to complete the task and style reward rS(s:t+1)to imitate human motion prior.
We employ adversarial motion prior (AMP) [ 36] to model the style reward, which incorporates an
adversarial discriminator Dto discriminate motions from simulated synthesis or tracked motion
dataset. It is trained with the objective:
argmin
D−EdM(st:t+t∗)[log(D(st:t+t∗))]−Edπ(st:t+t∗)[log(1 −D(st:t+t∗))]

,(1)
where dM(st:t+t∗)anddπ(st:t+t∗)are distributions of t∗-frame motion clips from dataset Mand
policy π. The first two items in Eq. 1 are to discriminate motions while the last item with a coefficient
wgpregularizes the gradient penalty [ 30] in adversarial training. The style reward rSto encourage
realistic motion synthesis is then formulated as
rS(s:t+1) =−log(1−D(st+1−t∗:t+1)). (2)
We uniformly conceptualize goal-conditioned object rearrangement as three processes: locomotion
towards the object, contacting the object, and relocating the object to the goal. These steps are
accomplished by unified progressively increasing task rewards.
4Despite the powers of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and adversarial motion prior, gen-
eralized object rearrangement tasks by humanoids still pose significant challenges. Previous
works [ 15,33,50] have been limited to simple tasks such as static sitting, lying, or carrying a
specific box. We propose new techniques to overcome challenges in generalized object rearrange-
ment. Generalized object interaction involves geometrically various objects. However, tracking
motion data for each individual object is labor-intensive, and infeasible to tackle novel objects. We
expect RL to enable automatic object generalization. Thus, we encode object geometry to learn a
geometry-aware policy and design a carry curriculum to facilitate the learning. Due to the misalign-
ment of objects in human motion data and the task, we propose style reward clipping to prioritize
high-level task execution. Navigating in a complex room requires high-level planning to avoid
collisions, we use in-context path planning to enable efficient locomotion. More detailed explanations
of our improved techniques are described in the following:
Geometry Encoding. Object state is crucial in HSI synthesis. Previous studies [ 15,47] primarily
encode object position, rotation, and linear and angular velocities to act on certain objects like
boxes or balls. A general policy for interactions with diverse objects should incorporate geometric
information. Thus, we augment the teacher policy with geometric object representations via Basis
Point Set (BPS) [ 37] encoding. A shared set of basis points is randomly sampled from a unit sphere
and encodes object geometry using delta vectors from each basis point to the nearest object point. In
contrast to geometries encoded by a neural net [ 38], BPS encoding is computationally efficient and
accelerates policy learning. Consequently, we use object geometry, position, rotation, and linear and
angular velocities to form a comprehensive object observation, thereby facilitating a more expressive
policy control.
Carry Curriculum Pre-training. Object rearrangement is conceptualized as a three-step process in
the aforementioned paragraph. However, directly learning the entire three-step rearrangement task
from scratch is challenging due to the long task horizon. Besides, physics-based object movement
presents greater challenges compared to kinematic object movement [ 24], primarily because the
object state is not directly editable. Instead, it requires indirect control of the physical humanoid
to interact. To this end, we draw inspiration from the curriculum learning [ 4] and design an easy
carry curriculum to pre-train the policy. The carry curriculum only includes the first two of three
steps: locomotion towards the object and carrying up the object for an in-the-air holding. The carry
curriculum has a shorter horizon and is empirically easier to converge. Furthermore, the pre-trained
in-the-air carry prior significantly benefits the subsequent object relocation. For the carry curriculum,
we use objects excluding those on the ground, such as tables and chairs, which are easier to move by
pushing and pulling along the ground without a lift. The carry curriculum shares the same learning
paradigm with the rearrangement task, except for a different two-stage reward design.
Style Reward Clipping. General object rearrangement involves manipulating novel objects that are
not recorded in tracked motion data. This creates a misalignment in optimization directions: strictly
imitating reference motion or ensuring high-level task execution. Previous work [ 15] balanced two
items by a weighted sum between task reward and style reward in motion-aligned tasks. However, in
our general object rearrangement setting, goal-conditioned task exploration progress can be stagnant
and the policy may learn actions devoid of task semantics following the logarithmic gradient in Eq. 2.
For instance, when the object is difficult to lift, the policy tends to mimic insignificant hand swings in
the motion data, rather than exploring carry-up actions. We insert a style reward clipping to prioritize
task execution, formulated as follows:
ξt= max( rG(g, st, st+1), ξmin), (3)
rt=wGrG(g, st, st+1) +wSmin(rS(s:t+1), ξt), (4)
where wG, wSare coefficients, and ξtis the upper bound for the style reward. This formulation
prioritizes goal-conditioned task execution over motion imitation in reward maximization. In addition,
we use a minimum upper bound ξmin, to ensure basic motion imitation during the early stages when
the task reward is near zero.
In-context Path Planning. Navigating a populated room requires high-level knowledge since the
dense object cluster may collide with the humanoid agent and obstruct natural locomotion. We use
in-context path planning to guide the navigation. Point clouds of all objects in the scene make up
the spatial occupancy. We perform top-down point projection and grid discretization to derive a 2D
obstacle map of 20cmx20cmgrids. We then plan a navigable path from the starting position to the

waypoints to guide locomotion at each step.
Incorporating all the above features, we present an overview of training HumanVLA-Teacher in Fig. 2.
Navigation waypoint, task goal, object state, and humanoid proprioception are sent to the policy
network to derive an action. The learning process is guided by task reward and motion discrimination
reward. Further details about the learning process can be found in the appendix.
3.2 Distilling into Vision-Language-Action Model
While the HumanVLA-Teacher πtchleverages privileged information such as object state, goal state,
and waypoint in the global coordinates, our biggest goal is towards practical humanoid control free
of privileged information and real-world deployable. To this end, we replace privileged states with
flexible egocentric vision and natural language instruction. Notably, the proprioception observation
is the only kept item from HumanVLA-Teacher to HumanVLA, which is represented in the local
coordinate and can be obtained via forward kinematics and temporal differentiation. The history
action is also used in observation. To obtain egocentric vision, we mount a mobile camera on the
head of the human. It renders a 256 x 256 image with a field of view spanning 90 degrees at each
step. An overview of training HumanVLA is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Behavior Cloning. We train HumanVLA πvlausing a teacher-student framework to distill the
knowledge from HumanVLA-Teacher via behavior cloning [ 2]. HumanVLA employs an EfficientNet-
B0[45] for image encoding and a frozen bert-base-uncased [10] for language encoding, whose
features, along with proprioception, last action, are sent to the action decoder to derive an action.
At each time step t, HumanVLA-Teacher leverages privileged state standgto derive an action
πtch(at|st, g)while HumanVLA derives an action πvla(at|pt, at−1, vt, l)based on proprioception
pt, last action at−1, egocentric image vt, and language instruction l. Behavior cloning bridges
distributions between πvla(at|pt, at−1, vt, l)andπtch(at|st, g), which can be directly implemented
via supervised learning. In the empirical training process, we observe a severe covariate shift problem
in offline behavior cloning. Thus, we opt for a DAgger [ 39] framework to train HumanVLA which
alleviates the problem via online learning.
Active Rendering. Though HumanVLA-Teacher possesses comprehensive knowledge in versatile
control, naive policy distillation still suffers from the gap of observation expressiveness. For instance,
while egocentric vision is used to perceive objects, the humanoid gaze might not properly focus on
the target object but renders a less informative image of the background. Consequently, the perception
quality of HumanVLA is significantly affected by the camera pose. However, an optimal camera
pose, determined by the head pose, is not guaranteed in the teacher policy, which only imitates a
life-like head motion but ignores the vision quality. We propose an active rendering technique to
encourage the camera to focus on the object. We analytically calculate the head-to-object direction in
the global coordinate and then derive a head orientation. Inverse kinematics is used to obtain active
rendering actions aar

4 Human-in-the-Room Dataset
Existing datasets [ 48,53] for object rearrangement are primarily designed for stretches with disc-
shaped mobility and gripper manipulation. Human-like embodiment has different physical attributes,
such as stronger motors to handle large furniture like chairs and tables. Besides, we follow [ 36,15,33,
50] to use a humanoid model with spherical hands, which can struggle with manipulating small-sized
objects, such as picking up a towel. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Human-in-the-
Room (HITR) dataset, designed to facilitate vision-language directed object rearrangement tasks on
a humanoid. The HITR dataset includes carefully designed objects of various sizes, ranging from
21cmto 126 cm, and provides a variety of rearrangement tasks in various rooms. Each task involves
separated, instantiable, and replaceable objects with defined initial and goal states. Additionally, each
task is accompanied by a natural language instruction generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).
In constructing the HITR dataset, we reference common objects used in room designs from [ 23,44,
53] and utilize object models from HSSD [ 22] to create basic assets. Object assets are manually
resized to ensure the interaction friendliness. We adopt the procedural generation pipeline from [ 9]
to generate diverse scenes. First, we manually design four room layouts: bedroom ,livingroom ,
kitchen , and warehouse , then randomly populate replaceable objects within these layout templates
to establish the scene, as well as the goal state. Next, we randomly relocate an object in the scene,
either to the ground or another receptacle. This relocated object is what the physical humanoid is
tasked to rearrange. We concatenate two rendered images of the initial and goal scenes and use
the composite image to prompt gpt-4-vision [31] to generate an instruction. The LLM is asked to
distinguish between two states and provide an instruction to guide the state transition. However, the
LLM still struggles with understanding complex spatial relationships, such as left-right errors. To
ensure the quality of instructions, we manually review and revise them as necessary. Ultimately, we
build the HITR dataset of 615 tasks, with an average of 6.5 objects per task. There are 50 static
objects like bedandcountertop , as well as 34 movable objects like pillow andvase. More details are
in the appendix.
5 Experiments
5.1 Settings
Datasets. Our experiments are conducted on the HITR dataset. It is split into train andtestsubsets
at a ratio of 9:1, containing 552 and 63 tasks respectively. The testsubset is used to evaluate the
generalizability of our method in unseen tasks. For the motion dataset used in training, we utilize
OMOMO [ 24] and a locomotion subset from SAMP [ 14]. OMOMO provides a variety of short-range
motions involving moving different objects, while locomotion motions from SAMP enhance the
locomotion aspect of our dataset. We use 30-minute motions in total. The source motion dataset
features object rearrangement involving only seven different objects, which is far less than those in
the HITR dataset. Despite this, we anticipate that our method can generalize to different objects.
Metrics. We adhere to a 10-second running time limit and follow [ 15] to evaluate methods with
three metrics. (1) Success Rate: the proportion of tasks that are successfully rearranged within an
error margin of θ.(2) Precision: the distance of the final object position to the goal. (3) Execution
Time the average time taken to complete a run. For the Success Rate, a higher value indicates
better performance, but for Precision and Execution Time, the lower the better. All experiments
are evaluated using 10 repeat runs. For state-based methods, we follow [ 15] to set θ= 20 cm.

For vision-language-based methods, where the goal is specified via coarse instructions rather than
precision goal coordinates, we set θ= 40 cm. This criteria relaxation is also adopted in past works [ 8]
for evaluating policies with different observations.
5.2 Implementation Details
We conduct experiments in parallel environments simulated using IsaacGym [ 28], with neural
networks implemented via PyTorch. Our physical humanoid model, following previous works [ 15,
33,50], comprises 15 rigid bodies and 28 joints, each actuated by a PD-Controller. The simulator
runs at 60Hz, and the policy is queried at 30Hz. The teacher policy is optimized using Proximal
Policy Optimization [ 40] and takes two days on eight Tesla V100 GPUs to converge. The student
policy is trained using DAgger [ 39] and takes one day on two GPUs. We provide comprehensive
details about hyperparameters, neural architectures, observation space, and more in the appendix.
5.3 Comparisons in Box Loco-Manipulation
While our work is pioneering in the exploration of vision-language-directed general object rear-
rangement, direct comparisons with previous studies are difficult. The work most similar to ours
is InterPhys [ 15], which delved into state-based box loco-manipulation. Due to the unavailability
of training data, motions, and codes of InterPhys [ 15], we instead refer to a box rearrangement
subset in HITR to conduct experiments. We train a state-based HumanVLA-Teacher using only
box rearrangement tasks, along with an implementation of the InterPhys baseline. Results of box
rearrangement are reported in Tab. 2. Given that the box is the simplest object to interact with, both
methods achieve high success rates. However, our method exhibits superior precision, with a result of
4.2cm, outperforming both the 8.3 cmin the official report [ 15] and the 12.6 cmin our implementation.
We use the standard deviation to evaluate the statistical significance of HumanVLA-Teacher in 10
repeated runs. The values are 0.02, 0.004, and 0.04 for Success Rate, Precision, and Execution Time
respectively. With high task completion rates and low variance, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our method in this first trial.
5.4 Ablation Study
We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the train split to validate each design choice, with
results presented in Tab. 3. Firstly, we evaluate the impact of improved techniques in HumanVLA-
Teacher training, which achieves a success rate of 85.9% and a precision of 14.4 cm. However,
eliminating any component leads to a decline in performance. The inclusion of geometry encoding
and carry curriculum enables the model to manipulate a variety of objects effectively. Without
either of these components, the success rate experiences a drop of approximately 20%. Style reward

clipping prioritizes task execution, whose absence results in a 6% decrease in the success rate. Path
planning helps humans navigate complex scenes. Its removal leads to a significant 18.5% decrease in
the success rate. Subsequently, we validate design choices in training HumanVLA directed by vision
and language. The default HumanVLA achieves a success rate of 74.8% with a precision of 42.6 cm.
However, the absence of active rendering results in a substantial 6.9% success rate drop, emphasizing
the importance of perception quality. We implement an offline behavior cloning baseline using ten
off-the-shell teacher trajectories per task for training. Without online learning, the system suffers
from a severe covariate shift and performs poorly.
5.5 Generalizing to Unseen Tasks
We use the testsplit of HITR to evaluate the generalizability of methods. The unseen data, which
includes novel scene compositions, visual appearances, and language instructions, poses a significant
challenge to our method. Results are presented in Tab. 4. The state-based HumanVLA-Teacher
tends to be more robust in unseen data. Relatively small drops in success rate (6.6%) and precision
(4.9cm) demonstrate strong generalizability of RL when using privileged information. Moreover, it
consistently outperforms the InterPhys [ 15] baseline on all metrics. Applying HumanVLA to unseen
tasks turns out to be more challenging due to the complexity of vision and language modalities.
The success rate of HumanVLA decreases to 60.2%, and the precision drops to 57.0 cm. However,
HumanVLA still consistently outperforms baselines without active rendering and the offline goal-
conditioned behavior-cloning (Offline GC-BC) [29] method.
5.6 Qualitative Results
We provide qualitative visualizations of how HumanVLA performs object rearrangement tasks in
Fig. 4. More results are available in the appendix. We demonstrate that HumanVLA is capable of
moving a pot, vase, chair, and box based on language instructions.
96 Conclusion
We investigate vision-language directed object rearrangement by physical humanoids in this work, a
fundamental technique for HSI synthesis and real-world humanoid robots. Our system is developed
using a teacher-student distillation framework. We propose key insights to facilitate teacher policy
learning with privileged states and introduce a novel active perception technique to favor vision-
language-action model learning. We present a novel HITR dataset to support our task. In extensive
experiments, our HumanVLA model demonstrates superior results in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Future works include dexterous manipulation by physical humanoids and long-horizon
multi-object interaction.

A Limitations
This work inherits the humanoid model from [ 36,35,15,33,50] with spherical hands. It is hard to
manipulate small-sized objects. Dexterous hands can be equipped to facilitate object manipulation in
future works.
As the first work on general object rearrangement, our task settings only include one object movement
at each time. Long-horizon object rearrangement is left for future work.
The current version of our system does not contain explicit memorizing, planning, navigation, and
multi-agent collaboration modules. We leave more ad-hoc designs to future work.
B Broader Impacts
We study simulated physical humans in the work, whose technique holds the potential for extension
to real-world humanoid robots. This could have a significant positive societal impact, as humanoid
robots have the potential to assist humanity in various ways. However, it is crucial to carefully
consider safety concerns associated with the use of humanoid robots.
C Licenses
We use assets from ASE [ 36], HSSD [ 22], OMOMO [ 24], and SAMP [ 14] in this work. ASE is
released under the NVIDIA license. HSSD is released under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license. OMOMO
does not have a specified license. SAMP is released with its license on its GitHub repository.
D Dataset
D.1 Generation Process
Figure 5 provides an illustration of how we construct the Human-in-the-Room (HITR) dataset,
following the procedural generation pipeline [ 9]. First, we manually design four distinct room
layouts: bedroom ,livingroom ,kitchen , and warehouse . These template layouts are subsequently
populated with various object models to create a set of diverse scenes, which serve as the goal states
https://github.com/mohamedhassanmus/SAMP?tab=readme-ov-file#license

Figure 7: Movable objects in HITR dataset.
for the rearrangement tasks. To generate the initial state of each task, we randomly relocate an object
to a different receptacle or to the ground. The initial position of the humanoid is randomly sampled
from the navigable areas. As for the initial orientation, the humanoid heads to the object. Our dataset
guarantees the object visibility in the first view and also covers the target position visibility in 89% of
tasks. Notably, our dataset does not specify the initial humanoid pose; instead, it is sampled from
the training motion dataset. We then concatenate images of the goal and initial states to create a
self-contained information carrier for each task. It is sent to a large language model, specifically
gpt-4-vision , along with language prompts, to generate the corresponding instruction.
D.2 Statistics
The HITR dataset contains 615 unique tasks in various rooms, examples of which are depicted in
Fig. 6. The dataset includes 34 movable objects and 50 static objects, all of which are sourced from
HSSD [ 22]. All movable objects are shown in Fig. 7 and span a wide range of categories such as chair ,
pillow ,plant ,coffeemaker , among others. To facilitate successful interaction with our humanoid
15model, we manually adjust the scale of object models and assign suitable weights. The sizes of the
objects vary from 21 cmto 126 cm, and their weights range from 5 kgto 20 kg. On average, there are
6.5 objects present in each scene.
E Details of the Approach
We describe the complete details of our approach in this section.
E.1 Training HumanVLA-Teacher
E.1.1 Observation Space
The observation space of HumanVLA-Teacher includes proprioception, object, goal, and waypoint.
The 223-dimensional proprioception includes:
•root height ∈ R1•root rotation ∈ R6
•root linear velocity ∈ R3•root angular velocity ∈ R3
•link position ∈ R14×3•link rotation ∈ R14×6
•link linear velocity ∈ R14×3•link angular velocity ∈ R14×3
The object state includes object position ( R3), rotation ( R6), linear velocity ( R3), angular velocity
(R3) and BPS [37] geometry ( R200×3) encoded by delta vectors of 200 basis points.
The goal state includes the goal position ( R3) and rotation ( R6).
The waypoint is denoted by xwp
t∈ R3.
We follow the default AMP [ 36] to use a projected observation space for the discriminator. They
include:
•root height ∈ R1•root rotation ∈ R6
•root linear velocity ∈ R3•root angular velocity ∈ R3
•joint rotation ∈ R12×6•joint velocity ∈ R28×1
•end-effector positions of left/right hand/foot, and head ∈ R5×3
•object position ∈ R3
We send 10 consecutive frames to the discriminator; thus the total dimension is R10×131.
All these features are represented in the local coordinate of the humanoid model. Rotations are
encoded using a 6-D normal-tangent representation.
E.1.2 Action Space
The action space ( R28) of HumanVLA-Teacher consists of the target positions for 28 Proportional-
Derivative controllers. Predicted actions are then utilized by the controllers to generate joint torques
for effective control.
E.1.3 Network Architecture
We adopt MLPs as the basic networks for HumanVLA-Teacher. Each linear layer is followed by
ReLU activation. The 600-dimensional BPS feature is compressed using an MLP of [512,512,128]
layers to generate a low-dimensional representation. This representation is then concatenated with all
other observations to derive the action and value. The actor, critic, and discriminator networks are all
separate MLPs with hidden layers of [1024, 1024, 512]. The actor and critic networks are trained
using default PPO [ 40] losses. The discriminator is trained using a cross-entropy loss via adversarial
learning.
E.1.4 In-context Path Planning
Navigating through intricate scenes is challenging due to the potential for unexpected object collisions.
To mitigate this, we employ in-context path planning to facilitate collision-free locomotion, as depicted
in Fig. 8. This process involves two substreams: planning a path from the humanoid to the object, and
then from the object to the goal. Initially, we sample point clouds from all objects in the scene. These
points are then projected top-down onto the ground and divided into 50 cmx 50cmgrids to construct
16Point Projection

a navigation map. We utilize the A∗algorithm [ 13] to plan two paths: one from the humanoid to
the object, and another from the object to the goal. Each path generated by the A∗algorithm is
represented by a series of densely packed waypoints. We consolidate waypoints that share a consistent
moving direction to create a sparse waypoint set. During task execution, the humanoid model is
guided by a sequence of these waypoints and is encouraged to move toward the waypoint at each
step. Once the humanoid reaches the waypoint within a 50 cmdistance, the waypoint proceeds to the
next. The last waypoint is the goal position. The waypoint is used in reward computation to guide the
movement, described in the following sections.
E.1.5 Carry Curriculum Pre-training
We uniformly conceptualize object rearrangement as a three-step process: locomotion towards the
object, making contact with the object, and then relocating the object to achieve the goal. However,
directly training these three processes from scratch can be exceptionally challenging. The main
difficulty lies in the fact that physical interactions with objects necessitate contacting prior, such
as robust object holding, to enable subsequent object dynamics. Through empirical experiments,
we have found that carrying objects to other receptacles is significantly more difficult than pushing
and pulling objects on the ground. This underscores the need to learn a carry prior to boosting the
subsequent object relocation.
Inspired by the curriculum learning paradigm [ 4], we design a carry curriculum pre-training scheme
to learn the carry prior. It encompasses the initial two steps, namely locomotion and contacting,
which form an easier curriculum compared to the difficult three-step rearrangement task. We exclude
on-ground objects in carry curriculum pre-training, whose initial height and goal height are both
smaller than 0.1 m. These objects, such as small table ,chair , can be relocated by direct on-ground
pushing and pulling without a lift. The goal of the carry curriculum is to enable the agent to walk
towards the object and establish a robust contact, allowing it to securely hold the object in the air;
thus, we define reward as a combination of walking reward and contacting reward:
rt=rwalk
t+rcontact
t (6)
where rwalk
t encourages the humanoid to walk to the object. Specifically, it encourages a closer
distance between root position xroot

t = 0.2 exp(−10||xobj
t−xhand
t||) + 0.5clip(hobj
t−hobj
init,0,∆h)/∆h (8)
E.1.6 Rearrangement Learning
The complete rearrangement task consists of the whole three-step process. The reward is formulated
as a combination of walking reward, contacting reward, and relocation reward:
rt=rwalk
t+rcontact
t +rrelocation
t (9)
where rwalk
t,rcontact
t have similar formulation but different weights and conditions compared to the
carry curriculum pre-training, specifically:
rwalk
t=(
0.1 exp(−0.5||xobj
t−xroot
t||) + 0.1 exp(−2||v∗−vroot
t·xwp
t||2)||xobj
t−xroot

t||) + 0.1clip(hobj
t−hobj
init,0,∆h)/∆h||xobj
t−xobj
goal||>0.5
0.2 otherwise
(11)
In the context of the rearrangement task, we do not set an explicit lifting condition, but instead require
the contact prior to enhance subsequent dynamics. As a result, the height change, ∆his reduced
to 0.1 mfor objects that are going to be carried, and to zero for objects that are consistently on the
ground.
rrelocation
t comprises four components, namely rvel
t,rfar
t,rnear
t, andrrot
t.rvel
tencourages moving
the object to the next waypoint xwp
t.rfar
tencourages a close distance to the next waypoint. rnear

encourages to meet the goal position xgoal.rrot
tencourages to meet the rotation position qgoal. They
are formulated as:

E.1.7 Hyperparameter Setting
We provide a hyperparameter table for HumanVLA-Teacher training in Tab. 5. It is shared for both
the carry curriculum pre-training and rearrangement learning.
E.2 Training HumanVLA
E.2.1 Observation Space
The observation space of HumanVLA includes proprioception, last action, egocentric image, and
language instruction.

The proprioception adheres to the 223-dimensional feature defined in the HumanVLA-Teacher
(Sec. E.1.1).
The last action is denoted by at−1∈ R28. An all-zero feature is used for it at the first step.
The egocentric image has 256 x 256 pixels with a field of view spanning 90 degrees. We mount a
camera on the head of the humanoid model, with the camera position offset from the head being
[0.103, 0, 0.175]. The camera direction aligns with the forward direction of the head.
The natural language instruction specifies the task goal.
E.2.2 Action Space
The action space for HumanVLA aligns with the 28-dimensional HumanVLA-Teacher action space
defined in Sec. E.1.2.
E.2.3 Network Architecture
The HumanVLA network consists of an image encoder, a text encoder, and an action decoder. The
image encoder is an EfficientNet-B0 [45] while the text encoder is a frozen bert-base-uncased [10].
Our primary design choices for these two models are their fast inference speed. The 1280-dimensional
EfficientNet-B0 feature is passed through a linear layer to yield a compressed 128-dimensional feature.
An MLP with [512,128] hidden layers is used to compress the 768-dimensional bert-base-uncased
feature down 128 dimensions. The compressed image and text features are then concatenated with
the proprioception and last action, and this combined feature is sent into the action decoder. The
action decoder is a 6-layer MLP, with each hidden layer being 1024-dimensional. Each linear layer is
followed by BatchNorm and ReLU. Skip connections are used between the first and third layers, as
well as between the third and fifth layers.
E.2.4 Active Rendering Action
We propose the active rendering technique to enhance the quality of visual perception and facilitate
object rearrangement. In this section, we provide more details on how to compute the active rendering
action, specifically applied to the neck to adjust the camera pose. The primary regulation focuses on
the camera’s target view, which is the forward direction. To determine this, we compute the center
of the object point cloud and use it as the target viewpoint. The direction from the camera position
to the point cloud center represents the expected forward direction of both the camera and the head.
Since the neck joint is a 3-DoF spherical joint, a single regulation can lead to ambiguous actions.
To address this, we introduce the second regulation that controls the side direction of the head. It is
perpendicular to the plane formed by the upward torso and the camera view. These two regulations
result in a unique head rotation. Finally, inverse kinematics is used to solve neck actions.
E.2.5 Learning Process
We train HumanVLA by cloning actions from HumanVLA-Teacher. At each step, the HumanVLA-
Teacher predicts an action using privileged information. It is mixed with an active rendering action to
yield the label for supervision. HumanVLA is optimized to minimize the mean square error.
We adopt a DAgger [ 39] framework to manage the online learning process. DAgger iteratively
schedules a mixed policy π=βtπtch+ (1−βt)πstuat epoch tto explore the environment and
expand a training dataset. It can alleviate the covariate shift problem between different policies. We
use an exponential function to schedule the mixing factor βt=β0∗λt.

w/o style reward clipping.

to get close to the sofa, while the yellow humanoid with path guidance learns to go around the central
table. Instruction: Move the pillow to the sofa.
E.2.6 Hyperparameter Setting
We provide a hyperparameter table for HumanVLA training in Tab. 6.
F Additional Results
F.1 Generalization
The primary test set of HITR contains task-level unseen tasks including new compositions of objects
in the scene, new placement of objects, and regenerated new text instructions from LLM describing
new compositions and new spatial relations. We have proven the generalization ability of HumanVLA
in unseen tasks.
However, generalization in any unseen without any similar pattern in the seen data is super challenging,
which is also an ultimate goal of embodied AI research. We build extra tiny unseen data to make
additional analysis and further disclose our method. We make additional testing data: (1) Unseen texts

generated for training tasks, manually reviewed to be distinct from training data. (2) Unseen objects
by changing visual appearance in training tasks. (3) Unseen object category (cup) with different
geometry. (4) Unseen scene layouts by repositioning static large objects.
Results are reported in Tab. 7. We find that our work suffers less from unseen texts and unseen visual
appearance. But generalizing to unseen object categories and execution in the unseen scenes remains
a main challenge.
F.2 Learning Curves
We plot the learning curves in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In Fig. 9,
our method has been proven to converge faster in task completion with style reward clipping. In
Fig. 10, active rendering improves perception quality and facilitates the learning of the student policy.
F.3 Qualitative Ablation
A qualitative ablation about the path planning module is represented in Fig. 11. Specifically, the green
humanoid fails to navigate close to the goal receptacle, i.e., the sofa. However, the yellow humanoid
is guided by planned waypoints to go around the center table and place the pillow on the sofa.
F.4 Additional Qualitative Results
We provide additional qualitative visualizations in Fig. 12 to disclose our results.
21NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This work studies vision-language directed object rearrangement. It have been
described in the abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limitations are in the appendix.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
22Justification: No theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide complete details in the appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
23Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Data and code are publicly available.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide complete details in the appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Statistical significance is reported in Sec. 5.3. We report the standard deviation
in 10 repeated runs to validate the robustness of our method. For a consistent result format
with InterPhys, they are not included in the main table.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
24•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Compute costs are in Sec. 5.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This paper conforms NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Broader impacts are in the appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
25•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited works of related assets. License are mentioned in the appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
26•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets introduced.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing experiment.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing experiment.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
